<span class="tag">12–1</span>The same equations have the same solutions</h3>
<div id="Ch12-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">The total amount of information which has been acquired about the
physical world since the beginning of scientific progress is enormous,
and it seems almost impossible that any one person could know a
reasonable fraction of it. But it is actually quite possible for a
physicist to retain a broad knowledge of the physical world rather
than to become a specialist in some narrow area. The reasons for this
are threefold: First, there are great principles which apply to all
the different kinds of phenomena—such as the principles of the
conservation of energy and of angular momentum. A thorough
understanding of such principles gives an understanding of a great
deal all at once. Second, there is the fact that many complicated
phenomena, such as the behavior of solids under compression, really
basically depend on electrical and quantum-mechanical forces, so that
if one understands the fundamental laws of electricity and quantum
mechanics, there is at least some possibility of understanding many of
the phenomena that occur in complex situations. Finally, there is a
most remarkable coincidence: <em class="emph">The equations for many different
physical situations have exactly the same appearance</em>. Of course, the
symbols may be different—one letter is substituted for another—but
the mathematical form of the equations is the same. This means that
having studied one subject, we immediately have a great deal of direct
and precise knowledge about the solutions of the equations of another.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch12-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We are now finished with the subject of electrostatics, and will soon
go on to study magnetism and electrodynamics. But before doing so, we
would like to show that while learning electrostatics we have
simultaneously learned about a large number of other subjects. We will
find that the equations of electrostatics appear in several other
places in physics. By a direct translation of the solutions (of course
the same mathematical equations must have the same solutions) it is
possible to solve problems in other fields with the same ease—or
with the same difficulty—as in electrostatics.</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The equations of electrostatics, we know, are
\begin{align}
\label{Eq:II:12:1}
\FLPdiv{(\kappa\FLPE)}&=\frac{\rho_{\text{free}}}{\epsO},\\[1ex]
\label{Eq:II:12:2}
\FLPcurl{\FLPE}&=\FLPzero.
\end{align}

(We take the equations of electrostatics with dielectrics so as to
have the most general situation.) The same physics can be expressed in
another mathematical form:
\begin{align}
\label{Eq:II:12:3}
\FLPE=&-\FLPgrad{\phi},\\[1ex]
\label{Eq:II:12:4}
\FLPdiv{(\kappa\,\FLPgrad{\phi})}&=-\frac{\rho_{\text{free}}}{\epsO}.
\end{align}
Now the point is that there are many physics problems whose
mathematical equations have the same form. There is a potential
($\phi$) whose gradient multiplied by a scalar function ($\kappa$) has
a divergence equal to another scalar function
($-\rho_{\text{free}}/\epsO$).</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Whatever we know about electrostatics can immediately be carried over
into that other subject, and <em class="emph">vice versa</em>. (It works both ways,
of course—if the other subject has some particular characteristics
that are known, then we can apply that knowledge to the corresponding
electrostatic problem.) We want to consider a series of examples from
different subjects that produce equations of this form.</p>

<div id="Ch12-S2" class="section">
<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">12–2</span>The flow of heat; a point source near an infinite plane boundary</h3>
<div id="Ch12-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We have discussed one example earlier (Section <a href="II_03.html#Ch3-S4">3–4</a>)—the
flow of heat. Imagine a block of material, which need not be homogeneous
but may consist of different materials at different places, in which the
temperature varies from point to point. As a consequence of these
temperature variations there is a flow of heat, which can be represented
by the vector $\FLPh$. It represents the amount of heat energy which
flows per unit time through a unit area perpendicular to the flow. The
divergence of $\FLPh$ represents the rate per unit volume at which heat
is leaving a region:
\begin{equation*}
\FLPdiv{\FLPh}=\text{rate of heat out per unit volume}.
\end{equation*}

(We could, of course, write the equation in integral form—just as we
did in electrostatics with Gauss’ law—which would say that the flux
through a surface is equal to the rate of change of heat energy inside
the material. We will not bother to translate the equations back and
forth between the differential and the integral forms, because it goes
exactly the same as in electrostatics.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch12-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">The rate at which heat is generated or absorbed at various places
depends, of course, on the problem. Suppose, for example, that there
is a source of heat inside the material (perhaps a radioactive source,
or a resistor heated by an electrical current). Let us call $s$ the
heat energy produced per unit volume per second by this source. There

a pipe with steam condensing inside.) The cylinder is covered with a
concentric sheath of insulating material which has a

<p class="p">How can we solve this problem? We have the differential equations, but
since these are the same as those of electrostatics, we have really
already solved the mathematical problem. The analogous problem is that
of a conductor of radius $a$ at the potential $\phi_1$, separated from
another conductor of radius $b$ at the potential $\phi_2$, with a
concentric layer of dielectric material in between, as drawn in
Fig. <a href="#Ch12-F1">12–1</a>(b). Now since the heat flow $\FLPh$ corresponds
to the electric field $\FLPE$, the quantity $G$ that we want to find
corresponds to the flux of the electric field from a unit length (in
other words, to the electric charge per unit length over $\epsO$). We
have solved the electrostatic problem by using Gauss’ law. We follow the
same procedure for our heat-flow problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch12-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">From the symmetry of the situation, we know that $h$ depends only on
the distance from the center. So we enclose the pipe in a gaussian
cylinder of length $L$ and radius $r$. From Gauss’ law, we know that
the heat flow $h$ multiplied by the area $2\pi rL$ of the surface must
be equal to the total amount of heat generated inside, which is what
we are calling $G$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:12:9}
2\pi rLh=G\quad\text{or}\quad h=\frac{G}{2\pi rL}.
\end{equation}

The heat flow is proportional to the temperature gradient:
\begin{equation*}
\FLPh=-K\,\FLPgrad{T},
\end{equation*}

or, in this case, the radial component of $\FLPh$ is
\begin{equation*}
h=-K\,\ddt{T}{r}.
\end{equation*}

This, together with (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII129">12.9</a>), gives
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:12:10}
\ddt{T}{r}=-\frac{G}{2\pi KLr}.
\end{equation}

Integrating from $r=a$ to $r=b$, we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:12:11}
T_2-T_1=-\frac{G}{2\pi KL}\ln\frac{b}{a}.
\end{equation}

Solving for $G$, we find
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:12:12}
G=\frac{2\pi KL(T_1-T_2)}{\ln(b/a)}.
\end{equation}

This result corresponds exactly to the result for the charge on a
cylindrical condenser:
\begin{equation*}
Q=\frac{2\pi\epsO L(\phi_1-\phi_2)}{\ln(b/a)}.

doesn’t absorb slow neutrons. In it the neutrons are free to wander
around. They travel in a straight line for several centimeters, on the
average, before being scattered by a nucleus and deflected into a new

region of radius $a$ (Fig. <a href="#Ch12-F7">12–7</a>). We would like to
know: What is the density of neutrons everywhere? How uniform is the
density of neutrons in the region where they are being generated? What
is the ratio of the neutron density at the center to the neutron
density at the surface of the source region? Finding the answers is
easy. The source density $S_0$ replaces the charge density $\rho$, so
our problem is the same as the problem of a sphere of uniform charge
density. Finding $N$ is just like finding the potential $\phi$. We
have already worked out the fields inside and outside of a uniformly
charged sphere; we can integrate them to get the potential. Outside,
the potential is $Q/4\pi\epsO r$, with the total charge $Q$ given
by $4\pi a^3\rho/3$. So
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:12:23}
\phi_{\text{outside}}=\frac{\rho a^3}{3\epsO r}.
\end{equation}

For points inside, the field is due only to the charge $Q(r)$ inside
the sphere of radius $r$, $Q(r)=4\pi r^3\rho/3$, so
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:12:24}
E=\frac{\rho r}{3\epsO}.
\end{equation}

The field increases linearly with $r$. Integrating $E$ to get $\phi$,
we have
\begin{equation*}
\phi_{\text{inside}}=-\frac{\rho r^2}{6\epsO}+\text{a constant}.
\end{equation*}

At the radius $a$, $\phi_{\text{inside}}$ must be the same
as $\phi_{\text{outside}}$, so the constant must be $\rho
a^2/2\epsO$. (We are assuming that $\phi$ is zero at large distances
from the source, which will correspond to $N$ being zero for the
neutrons.) Therefore,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:12:25}
\phi_{\text{inside}}=\frac{\rho}{3\epsO}
\biggl(\frac{3a^2}{2}-\frac{r^2}{2}\biggr).

is $3/2$. A uniform source doesn’t produce a uniform density of
neutrons. You see, our knowledge of electrostatics gives us a good

<div id="Ch12-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s now consider an example which is not really a very good one,
because the equations we will use will not really represent the
subject with complete generality but only in an artificial idealized
situation. We take up the problem of <em class="emph">water flow</em>. In the case of
the stretched sheet, our equations were an approximation which was
correct only for <em class="emph">small deflections</em>. For our consideration of
water flow, we will not make that kind of an approximation; we must
make restrictions that do not apply at all to real water. We treat
only the case of the steady flow of an <em class="emph">incompressible,
nonviscous, circulation-free</em> liquid. Then we represent the flow by
giving the velocity $\FLPv(\FLPr)$ as a function of
position $\FLPr$. If the motion is steady (the only case for which there is an
electrostatic analog) $\FLPv$ is independent of time. If $\rho$ is the
density of the fluid, then $\rho\FLPv$ is the amount of mass which
passes per unit time through a unit area. By the conservation of
matter, the divergence of $\rho\FLPv$ will be, in general, the time
rate of change of the mass of the material per unit volume. We will
assume that there are no processes for the continuous creation or
destruction of matter. The conservation of matter then requires
that $\FLPdiv{\rho\FLPv}=0$. (It should, in general, be equal
to $-\ddpl{\rho}{t}$, but since our fluid is incompressible, $\rho$
cannot change.) Since $\rho$ is everywhere the same, we can factor it
out, and our equation is simply
\begin{equation*}
\FLPdiv{\FLPv}=0.

does not tell us enough; we need still an additional equation. To
match electrostatics, we should have also that the <em class="emph">curl</em> of
$\FLPv$ is zero. But that is not generally true for real liquids. Most
liquids will ordinarily develop some circulation. So we are restricted
to the situation in which there is no circulation of the fluid. Such
flow is often called <em class="emph">irrotational</em>. Anyway, if we make all our
assumptions, we can <em class="emph">imagine</em> a case of fluid flow that is
analogous to electrostatics. So we take
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:12:28}

follows these equations is far from the great majority, but there are a few.
They must be cases in which we can neglect surface tension, compressibility, and
viscosity, and in which we can assume that the flow is irrotational. These
assumptions are valid so rarely for real water that the mathematician John
von Neumann said that people who analyze
Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1228">12.28</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1229">12.29</a>) are studying “dry

What is the physical meaning of $\psi$? There isn’t any very useful
meaning. The velocity can be written as the gradient of a potential
simply because the flow is irrotational. And by analogy with
electrostatics, $\psi$ is called the <em class="emph">velocity potential</em>, but it
is not related to a potential energy in the way that $\phi$ is. Since
the divergence of $\FLPv$ is zero, we have

too fast, little whirlpools (turbulence) will appear in its wake and
there will be some circulation of the water. But if the ball is going

out the potential. We want a potential that satisfies
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1231">12.31</a>) everywhere, and which also satisfies two
restrictions: (1) there is no flow in the spherical region inside the
surface of the ball, and (2) the flow is constant at large distances. To
satisfy (1), the component of $\FLPv$ normal to the surface of the
sphere must be zero. That means that $\ddpl{\psi}{r}$ is zero at $r=a$.
To satisfy (2), we must have $\ddpl{\psi}{z}=v_0$ at all points
where $r\gg a$. Strictly speaking, there is no electrostatic case which
corresponds exactly to our problem. It really corresponds to putting a
sphere of dielectric constant <em class="emph">zero</em> in a uniform electric field.
If we had worked out the solution to the problem of a sphere of a
dielectric constant $\kappa$ in a uniform field, then by
putting $\kappa=0$ we would immediately have the solution to this problem.</p>

<p class="p">Our problem involves a new kind of boundary condition, not one for
which $\phi$ is a constant on a surface, but for
which $\ddpl{\phi}{r}$ is a constant. That is a little different. It is not
easy to get the answer immediately. First of all, without the sphere,
$\phi$ would be $-E_0z$. Then $\FLPE$ would be in the $z$-direction
and have the constant magnitude $E_0$, everywhere. Now we have
analyzed the case of a dielectric sphere which has a uniform
polarization inside it, and we found that the field inside such a
polarized sphere is a uniform field, and that outside it is the same
as the field of a point dipole located at the center. So let’s guess
that the solution we want is a superposition of a uniform field plus
the field of a dipole. The potential of a dipole
(Chapter <a href="II_06.html">6</a>) is $pz/4\pi\epsO r^3$. Thus we assume that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:12:33}
\phi=-E_0z+\frac{pz}{4\pi\epsO r^3}.
\end{equation}

Since the dipole field falls off as $1/r^3$, at large distances we
have just the field $E_0$. Our guess will automatically satisfy
condition (2) above. But what do we take for the dipole strength $p$?
To find out, we may use the other condition on $\phi$,
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1232">12.32</a>). We must differentiate $\phi$ with respect
to $r$, but of course we must do so at a constant angle $\theta$, so it is
more convenient if we first express $\phi$ in terms of $r$ and $\theta$,
rather than of $z$ and $r$. Since $z=r\cos\theta$, we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:12:34}
\phi=-E_0r\cos\theta+\frac{p\cos\theta}{4\pi\epsO r^2}.
\end{equation}

The radial component of $\FLPE$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:12:35}
-\ddp{\phi}{r}=+E_0\cos\theta+\frac{p\cos\theta}{2\pi\epsO r^3}.

This must be zero at $r=a$ for all $\theta$. This will be true if

p=-2\pi\epsO a^3E_0.

<p class="p">In this section we turn to a completely different physical
problem—we want to illustrate the great variety of
possibilities. This time we will do something that leads to the same
kind of <em class="emph">integral</em> that we found in electrostatics. (If we have a
mathematical problem which gives us a certain integral, then we know
something about the properties of that integral if it is the same
integral that we had to do for another problem.) We take our example
from illumination engineering. Suppose there is a light source at the
distance $a$ above a plane surface. What is the illumination of the
surface? That is, what is the radiant energy per unit time arriving at
a unit area of the surface? (See Fig. <a href="#Ch12-F9">12–9</a>.) We suppose
that the source is spherically symmetric, so that light is radiated
equally in all directions. Then the amount of radiant energy which
passes through a unit area <em class="emph">at right angles</em> to a light flow
varies inversely as the square of the distance. It is evident that the
intensity of the light in the direction normal to the flow is given by
the same kind of formula as for the electric field from a point
source. If the light rays meet the surface at an angle $\theta$ to the
normal, then $I_n$, the energy arriving <em class="emph">per unit area</em> of the
surface, is only $\cos\theta$ as great, because the same energy goes
onto an area larger by $1/\cos\theta$. If we call the strength of our
light source $S$, then $I_n$, the illumination of a surface, is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:12:39}
I_n=\frac{S}{r^2}\,\FLPe_r\cdot\FLPn,
\end{equation}

where $\FLPe_r$ is the unit vector from the source and $\FLPn$ is the
unit normal to the surface. The illumination $I_n$ corresponds to the
normal component of the electric field from a point charge of
strength $4\pi\epsO S$. Knowing that, we see that for any distribution of light
sources, we can find the answer by solving the corresponding
electrostatic problem. We calculate the vertical component of electric
field on the plane due to a distribution of charge in the same way as
for that of the light sources.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a></p>

<p class="p">Consider the following example. We wish for some special experimental

uniform illumination. We have available long tubular fluorescent
lights which radiate uniformly along their lengths. We can illuminate
the table by placing the fluorescent tubes in a regular array on the
ceiling, which is at the height $z$ above the table. What is the
widest spacing $b$ from tube to tube that we should use if we want the

<div id="Ch12-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">In Chapter <a href="II_07.html">7</a> we saw that the electric field of a grid of
charged wires could be represented as a sum of terms, each one of
which gave a sinusoidal variation of the field with a period of $b/n$,
where $n$ is an integer. The amplitude of any one of these terms is
given by Eq. (<a href="II_07.html#mjx-eqn-EqII744">7.44</a>):
\begin{equation*}
F_n=A_ne^{-2\pi nz/b}.
\end{equation*}

We need consider only $n=1$, so long as we only want the field at
points not too close to the grid. For a complete solution, we would
still need to determine the coefficients $A_n$, which we have not yet
done (although it is a straightforward calculation). Since we need
only $A_1$, we can estimate that its magnitude is roughly the same as
that of the average field. The exponential factor would then give us
directly the <em class="emph">relative</em> amplitude of the variations. If we want
this factor to be $10^{-3}$, we find that $b$ must be $0.91z$. If we
make the spacing of the fluorescent tubes $3/4$ of the distance to the
ceiling, the exponential factor is then $1/4000$, and we have a safety
factor of $4$, so we are fairly sure that we will have the
illumination constant to one part in a thousand. (An exact calculation
shows that $A_1$ is really twice the average field, so
that $b\approx0.83z$.) It is somewhat surprising that for such a uniform
illumination the allowed separation of the tubes comes out so large.</p>

therefore obeys the same equations. That sounds like a good
explanation, but let us think. The electrostatic potential, the
diffusion of neutrons, heat flow—are we really dealing with the same
stuff? Can we really imagine that the electrostatic potential is
<em class="emph">physically</em> identical to the temperature, or to the density of
particles? Certainly $\phi$ is not <em class="emph">exactly the same</em> as the

neutrons running around. Certainly the motion of an individual neutron
is a completely different thing from the smooth variation we get from

which the physics is put? As long as things are reasonably smooth in
space, then the important things that will be involved will be the
rates of change of quantities with position in space. That is why we
always get an equation with a gradient. The derivatives <em class="emph">must</em>
appear in the form of a gradient or a divergence; because the laws of
physics are <em class="emph">independent of direction</em>, they must be expressible
in vector form. The equations of electrostatics are the simplest
vector equations that one can get which involve only the spatial

there is some as yet undiscovered underlying “machinery,” and that
the details of an underlying complexity are hidden in the

neutrons. But no one has yet formulated a successful theory that works
that way.</p>
