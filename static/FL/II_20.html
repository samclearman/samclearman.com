When we put all these equations together, a remarkable new phenomenon
occurs: fields generated by moving charges can leave the sources and
travel alone through space. We considered a special example in which
an infinite current sheet is suddenly turned on. After the current has
been on for the time $t$, there are uniform electric and magnetic
fields extending out the distance $ct$ from the source. Suppose that
the current sheet lies in the $yz$-plane with a surface current
density $J$ going toward positive $y$. The electric field will have
only a $y$-component, and the magnetic field, only a
$z$-component. The field components are given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:2}
E_y=cB_z=-\frac{J}{2\epsO c},
\end{equation}

for positive values of $x$ less than $ct$. For larger $x$ the fields
are zero. There are, of course, similar fields extending the same
distance from the current sheet in the negative $x$-direction. In
Fig. <a href="#Ch20-F1">20–1</a> we show a graph of the magnitude of the
fields as a function of $x$ at the instant $t$. As time goes on, the
“wavefront” at $ct$ moves outward in $x$ at the constant
velocity $c$.</p>

unit strength for a while, then suddenly increase the current strength
to three units, and hold it constant at this value. What do the fields
look like then? We can see what the fields will look like in the
following way. First, we imagine a current of unit strength that is
turned on at $t=0$ and left constant forever. The fields for
positive $x$ are then given by the graph in part (a) of Fig. <a href="#Ch20-F2">20–2</a>.

<p class="p">Now let’s take a more complicated problem. Consider a current which is
turned on to one unit for a while, then turned up to three units, and
later turned off to zero. What are the fields for such a current? We
can find the solution in the same way—by adding the solutions of
three separate problems. First, we find the fields for a step current
of unit strength. (We have solved that problem already.)  Next, we
find the fields produced by a step current of two units. Finally, we
solve for the fields of a step current of <em class="emph">minus</em> three
units. When we add the three solutions, we will have a current which
is one unit strong from $t=0$ to some later time, say $t_1$, then
three units strong until a still later time $t_2$, and then turned
off—that is, to zero. A graph of the current as a function of time
is shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch20-F3">20–3</a>(a). When we add the three
solutions for the electric field, we find that its variation with $x$,
at a given instant $t$, is as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch20-F3">20–3</a>(b). The
field is an exact representation of the current. The field distribution
in space is a nice graph of the current variation with time—only drawn
backwards. As time goes on the whole picture moves outward at the
speed $c$, so there is a little blob of field, travelling toward positive $x$,
which contains a completely detailed memory of the history of all the
current variations. If we were to stand miles away, we could tell from
the variation of the electric or magnetic field exactly how the current
had varied at the source.</p>

completely stopped and all charges and currents are zero, the block of
field continues to travel through space. We have a distribution of
electric and magnetic fields that exist independently of any charges
or currents. That is the new effect that comes from the complete set
of Maxwell’s equations. If we want, we can give a complete
mathematical representation of the analysis we have just done by
writing that the electric field at a given place and a given time is
proportional to the current at the source, only not at the <em class="emph">same</em>
time, but at the <em class="emph">earlier</em> time $t-x/c$. We can write

<p class="p">We have, believe it or not, already derived this same equation from
another point of view in Vol. I, when we were dealing with the
theory of the index of refraction. Then, we had to figure out what
fields were produced by a thin layer of oscillating dipoles in a sheet
of dielectric material with the dipoles set in motion by the electric
field of an incoming electromagnetic wave. Our problem was to
calculate the combined fields of the original wave and the waves
radiated by the oscillating dipoles. How could we have calculated the
fields generated by moving charges when we didn’t have Maxwell’s
equations? At that time we took as our starting point (without any
derivation) a formula for the radiation fields produced at large
distances from an accelerating point charge. If you will look in
Chapter <a href="I_31.html">31</a> of Vol. I, you will see that
Eq. (<a href="I_31.html#mjx-eqn-EqI319">31.9</a>) there is just the same as the
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII203">20.3</a>) that we have just written down. Although our

<p class="p">We want now to look in a general way at the behavior of electric and
magnetic fields in empty space far away from the sources, i.e., from
the currents and charges. Very near the sources—near enough so that
during the delay in transmission, the source has not had time to
change much—the fields are very much the same as we have found in
what we called the electrostatic or magnetostatic cases. If we go out
to distances large enough so that the delays become important,
however, the nature of the fields can be radically different from the
solutions we have found. In a sense, the fields begin to take on a
character of their own when they have gone a long way from all the
sources. So we can begin by discussing the behavior of the fields in a
region where there are no currents or charges.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose we ask: What kind of fields can there be in regions where
$\rho$ and $\FLPj$ are both zero? In Chapter <a href="II_18.html">18</a> we saw
that the physics of Maxwell’s equations could also be expressed in
terms of differential equations for the scalar and vector potentials:
\begin{align}
\label{Eq:II:20:4}
\nabla^2\phi-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial t^2}&=
-\frac{\rho}{\epsO},\\[1ex]
\label{Eq:II:20:5}
\nabla^2\FLPA-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\FLPA}{\partial t^2}&=
-\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO c^2}.
\end{align}

If $\rho$ and $\FLPj$ are zero, these equations take on the simpler
form
\begin{align}
\label{Eq:II:20:6}
\nabla^2\phi-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial t^2}&=0,\\[1ex]
\label{Eq:II:20:7}
\nabla^2\FLPA-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\FLPA}{\partial t^2}&=\FLPzero.
\end{align}

Thus in free space the scalar potential $\phi$ and each component of
the vector potential $\FLPA$ all satisfy the same mathematical
equation. Suppose we let $\psi$ (psi) stand for any one of the four
quantities $\phi$, $A_x$, $A_y$, $A_z$; then we want to investigate
the general solutions of the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:8}
\nabla^2\psi-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial t^2}=0.
\end{equation}

This equation is called the three-dimensional wave
equation—three-dimensional, because the function $\psi$ may depend
in general on $x$, $y$, and $z$, and we need to worry about variations
in all three coordinates. This is made clear if we write out
explicitly the three terms of the Laplacian operator:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:9}
\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2}+
\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial y^2}+
\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial z^2}-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial t^2}=0.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">In free space, the electric fields $\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$ also satisfy
the wave equation. For example, since $\FLPB=\FLPcurl{\FLPA}$, we can
get a differential equation for $\FLPB$ by taking the curl of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII207">20.7</a>). Since the Laplacian is a scalar operator, the
order of the Laplacian and curl operations can be interchanged:
\begin{equation*}
\FLPcurl{(\nabla^2\FLPA)}=\nabla^2(\FLPcurl{\FLPA})=\nabla^2\FLPB.
\end{equation*}

Similarly, the order of the operations curl and $\ddpl{}{t}$ can be
interchanged:
\begin{equation*}
\FLPcurl{\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\FLPA}{\partial t^2}}=
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}(\FLPcurl{\FLPA})=
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\FLPB}{\partial t^2}.
\end{equation*}

Using these results, we get the following differential equation
for $\FLPB$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:10}
\nabla^2\FLPB-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\FLPB}{\partial t^2}=\FLPzero.
\end{equation}

So each component of the magnetic field $\FLPB$ satisfies the
three-dimensional wave equation. Similarly, using the fact that
$\FLPE=-\FLPgrad{\phi}-\ddpl{\FLPA}{t}$, it follows that the electric
field $\FLPE$ in free space also satisfies the three-dimensional wave
equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:11}
\nabla^2\FLPE-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\FLPE}{\partial t^2}=\FLPzero.

<p class="p">All of our electromagnetic fields satisfy the same wave equation,
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII208">20.8</a>). We might well ask: What is the most general
solution to this equation? However, rather than tackling that
difficult question right away, we will look first at what can be said
in general about those solutions in which nothing varies in $y$
and $z$. (Always do an easy case first so that you can see what is going
to happen, and then you can go to the more complicated cases.) Let’s
suppose that the magnitudes of the fields depend only upon $x$—that
there are no <em class="emph">variations</em> of the fields with $y$ and $z$. We are,
of course, considering plane waves again. We should expect to get
results something like those in the previous section. In fact, we will
find precisely the same answers. You may ask: “Why do it all over
again?” It is important to do it again, first, because we did not
show that the waves we found were the most general solutions for plane
waves, and second, because we found the fields only from a very
particular kind of current source. We would like to ask now: What is
the most general kind of one-dimensional wave there can be in free
space? We cannot find that by seeing what happens for this or that
particular source, but must work with greater generality. Also we are
going to work this time with differential equations instead of with
integral forms. Although we will get the same results, it is a way of
practicing back and forth to show that it doesn’t make any difference
which way you go. You should know how to do things every which way,
because when you get a hard problem, you will often find that only one
of the various ways is tractable.</p>

\end{equation}

We are assuming that there are no variations with $y$ and $z$, so the
last two terms are zero. This equation then tells us that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:14}
\ddp{E_x}{x}=0.

Its solution is that $E_x$, the component of the electric field in the

The $x$-component of $\FLPcurl{\FLPE}$ is zero because the derivatives
with respect to $y$ and $z$ are zero. The $y$-component is also zero;
the first term is zero because the derivative with respect to $z$ is
zero, and the second term is zero because $E_z$ is zero. The only
components of the curl of $\FLPE$ that is not zero is the
$z$-component, which is equal to $\ddpl{E_y}{x}$. Setting the three
components of $\FLPcurl{\FLPE}$ equal to the corresponding components
of $-\ddpl{\FLPB}{t}$, we can conclude the following:
\begin{align}

Since the $x$-component of the magnetic field and the $y$-component of
the magnetic field both have zero time derivatives, these two
components are just constant fields and correspond to the
magnetostatic solutions we found earlier. Somebody may have left some
permanent magnets near where the waves are propagating. We will ignore

that the longitudinal component of the magnetic field can have no
variation with $x$. Since we are ignoring such uniform fields in our

We see that $\psi$ does indeed satisfy the one-dimensional wave
equation.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S1-p25" class="para">
<p class="p">You may be wondering: “If I have the wave equation, how do I know
that I should take $f(x-ct)$ as a solution? I don’t like this backward
method. Isn’t there some <em class="emph">forward</em> way to find the solution?”
Well, one good forward way is to know the solution. It is possible to
“cook up” an apparently forward mathematical argument, especially
because we know what the solution is supposed to be, but with an
equation as simple as this we don’t have to play games. Soon you will
get so that when you see Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2020">20.20</a>), you nearly
simultaneously see $\psi=f(x-xt)$ as a solution. (Just as now when you
see the integral of $x^2\,dx$, you know right away that the answer
is $x^3/3$.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S1-p26" class="para">
<p class="p">Actually you should also see a little more. Not only is any function
of $(x-ct)$ a solution, but any function of $(x+ct)$ is also a
solution. Since the wave equation contains only $c^2$, changing the
sign of $c$ makes no difference. In fact, the <em class="emph">most general</em>
solution of the one-dimensional wave equation is the sum of two
arbitrary functions, one of $(x-ct)$ and the other of $(x+ct)$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:24}
\psi=f(x-ct)+g(x+ct).
\end{equation}

The first term represents a wave travelling toward positive $x$, and
the second term an arbitrary wave travelling toward negative $x$. The
general solution is the superposition of two such waves both existing
at the same time.</p>

This equation isn’t in the form of a function of $(x-ct)$ or
of $(x+ct)$. Yet you can easily show that this function is a solution of
the wave equation by direct substitution into Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2020">20.20</a>).

<p class="p">Applying our conclusions about the solution of the wave equation to
the $y$-component of the electric field, $E_y$, we conclude that $E_y$
can vary with $x$ in any arbitrary fashion. However, the fields which
do exist can always be considered as the sum of two patterns. One wave
is sailing through space in one direction with speed $c$, with an
associated magnetic field perpendicular to the electric field; another
wave is travelling in the opposite direction with the same speed. Such
waves correspond to the electromagnetic waves that we know
about—light, radiowaves, infrared radiation, ultraviolet radiation,
x-rays, and so on. We have already discussed the radiation of light in
great detail in Vol. I. Since everything we learned there applies to
any electromagnetic wave, we don’t need to consider in great detail
here the behavior of these waves.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S1-p29" class="para">
<p class="p">We should perhaps make a few further remarks on the question of the
polarization of the electromagnetic waves. In our solution we chose to
consider the special case in which the electric field has only a
$y$-component. There is clearly another solution for waves travelling
in the plus or minus $x$-direction, with an electric field which has
only a $z$-component. Since Maxwell’s equations are linear, the
general solution for one-dimensional waves propagating in the
$x$-direction is the sum of waves of $E_y$ and waves of $E_z$. This
general solution is summarized in the following equations:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:25}
\begin{aligned}
\FLPE&=(0,E_y,E_z)\\[.5ex]
E_y&=f(x-ct)+g(x+ct)\\[.5ex]
E_z&=F(x-ct)+G(x+ct)\\[1ex]
\FLPB&=(0,B_y,B_z)\\[.5ex]
cB_z&=f(x-ct)-g(x+ct)\\[.5ex]
cB_y&=-F(x-ct)+G(x+ct).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Such electromagnetic waves have an $\FLPE$-vector whose direction is
not constant but which gyrates around in some arbitrary way in the
$yz$-plane. At every point the magnetic field is always perpendicular
to the electric field and to the direction of propagation.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S1-p30" class="para">
<p class="p">If there are only waves travelling in one direction, say the positive
$x$-direction, there is a simple rule which tells the relative
orientation of the electric and magnetic fields. The rule is that the
cross product $\FLPE\times\FLPB$—which is, of course, a vector at
right angles to both $\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$—points in the direction in
which the wave is travelling. If $\FLPE$ is rotated into $\FLPB$ by a
right-hand screw, the screw points in the direction of the wave
velocity. (We shall see later that the vector $\FLPE\times\FLPB$ has a
special physical significance: it is a vector which describes the flow
of energy in an electromagnetic field.)</p>

<span class="tag">20–2</span>Three-dimensional waves</h3>
<div id="Ch20-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We want now to turn to the subject of three-dimensional waves. We have
already seen that the vector $\FLPE$ satisfies the wave equation. It
is also easy to arrive at the same conclusion by arguing directly from
Maxwell’s equations. Suppose we start with the equation
\begin{equation*}
\FLPcurl{\FLPE}=-\ddp{\FLPB}{t}
\end{equation*}

and take the curl of both sides:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:26}
\FLPcurl{(\FLPcurl{\FLPE})}=-\ddp{}{t}(\FLPcurl{\FLPB}).
\end{equation}

You will remember that the curl of the curl of any vector can be
written as the sum of two terms, one involving the divergence and the
other the Laplacian,
\begin{equation*}
\FLPcurl{(\FLPcurl{\FLPE})}=\FLPgrad{(\FLPdiv{\FLPE})}-\nabla^2\FLPE.
\end{equation*}

In free space, however, the divergence of $\FLPE$ is zero, so only the
Laplacian term remains. Also, from the fourth of Maxwell’s equations
in free space [Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2012">20.12</a>)] the time derivative
of $c^2\,\FLPcurl{\FLPB}$ is the second derivative of $\FLPE$ with
respect to $t$:
\begin{equation*}
c^2\,\ddp{}{t}(\FLPcurl{\FLPB})=\frac{\partial^2\FLPE}{\partial t^2}.
\end{equation*}

Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2026">20.26</a>) then becomes
\begin{equation*}
\nabla^2\FLPE=\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\FLPE}{\partial t^2},
\end{equation*}

which is the three-dimensional wave equation. Written out in all its
glory, this equation is, of course,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:27}
\frac{\partial^2\FLPE}{\partial x^2}+
\frac{\partial^2\FLPE}{\partial y^2}+
\frac{\partial^2\FLPE}{\partial z^2}-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\FLPE}{\partial t^2}=\FLPzero.
\end{equation}

</div>
<div id="Ch20-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">How shall we find the general wave solution? The answer is that all
the solutions of the three-dimensional wave equation can be
represented as a superposition of the one-dimensional solutions we
have already found. We obtained the equation for waves which move in
the $x$-direction by supposing that the field did not depend on $y$
and $z$. Obviously, there are other solutions in which the fields do
not depend on $x$ and $z$, representing waves going in the
$y$-direction. Then there are solutions which do not depend on $x$
and $y$, representing waves travelling in the $z$-direction. Or in
general, since we have written our equations in vector form, the
three-dimensional wave equation can have solutions which are plane
waves moving in any direction at all. Again, since the equations are
linear, we may have simultaneously as many plane waves as we wish,
travelling in as many different directions. Thus the most general
solution of the three-dimensional wave equation is a superposition of
all sorts of plane waves moving in all sorts of directions.</p>

present in the space in this lecture room. First of all, there is a
steady magnetic field; it comes from the currents in the interior of
the earth—that is, the earth’s steady magnetic field. Then there are
some irregular, nearly static electric fields produced perhaps by
electric charges generated by friction as various people move about in
their chairs and rub their coat sleeves against the chair arms. Then
there are other magnetic fields produced by oscillating currents in
the electrical wiring—fields which vary at a frequency of
$60$ cycles per second, in synchronism with the generator at Boulder
Dam. But more interesting are the electric and magnetic fields varying
at much higher frequencies. For instance, as light travels from window
to floor and wall to wall, there are little wiggles of the electric
and magnetic fields moving along at $186{,}000$ miles per second. Then
there are also infrared waves travelling from the warm foreheads to
the cold blackboard. And we have forgotten the ultraviolet light, the
x-rays, and the radiowaves travelling through the room.</p>

that the room is full of invisible angels? No, it is not like imagining
invisible angels. It requires a much higher degree of imagination to
understand the electromagnetic field than to understand invisible
angels. Why?  Because to make invisible angels understandable, all I
have to do is to alter their properties <em class="emph">a little bit</em>—I make
them slightly visible, and then I can see the shapes of their wings,
and bodies, and halos. Once I succeed in imagining a visible angel,
the abstraction required—which is to take almost invisible angels
and imagine them completely invisible—is relatively easy. So you
say, “Professor, please give me an approximate description of the

that I too can see them as well as I can see almost invisible

of experience thinking about these wiggling waves. When I start
describing the magnetic field moving through space, I speak of the
$\FLPE$- and $\FLPB$-fields and wave my arms and you may imagine that
I can see them. I’ll tell you what I see. I see some kind of vague
shadowy, wiggling lines—here and there is an $E$ and $B$ written on
them somehow, and perhaps some of the lines have arrows on them—an
arrow here or there which disappears when I look too closely at
it. When I talk about the fields swishing through space, I have a
terrible confusion between the symbols I use to describe the objects
and the objects themselves. I cannot really make a picture that is
even nearly like the true waves. So if you have some difficulty in
making such a picture, you should not be worried that your difficulty
is unusual.</p>

<div id="Ch20-S3-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Our science makes terrific demands on the imagination. The degree of
imagination that is required is much more extreme than that required
for some of the ancient ideas. The modern ideas are much harder to
imagine. We use a lot of tools, though. We use mathematical equations

I talk about the electromagnetic field in space, I see some kind of a
superposition of all of the diagrams which I’ve ever seen drawn about
them. I don’t see little bundles of field lines running about because
it worries me that if I ran at a different speed the bundles would
disappear, I don’t even always see the electric and magnetic fields

potential and the scalar potential, for those were perhaps the more
physically significant things that were wiggling.</p>

what is a mathematical view? From a mathematical view, there is an

you imagine six numbers associated with each point in space? That’s
too hard. Can you imagine even <em class="emph">one</em> number associated with every
point?  I cannot! I can imagine such a thing as the temperature at
every point in space. That seems to be understandable. There is a
hotness and coldness that varies from place to place. But I honestly

a piece of jello? Suppose that we were to begin by imagining that the
world was filled with thin jello and that the fields represented some
distortion—say a stretching or twisting—of the jello. Then we could
visualize the field. After we “see” what it is like we could abstract
the jello away. For many years that’s what people tried to do.
Maxwell, Ampère, Faraday, and others tried to understand electromagnetism this way. (Sometimes they
called the abstract jello “ether.”) But it turned out that the attempt
to imagine the electromagnetic field in that way was really standing in
the way of progress. We are unfortunately limited to abstractions, to
using instruments to detect the field, to using mathematical symbols to
describe the field, etc. But nevertheless, in some sense the fields are
real, because after we are all finished fiddling around with
mathematical equations—with or without making pictures and drawings or
trying to visualize the thing—we can still make the instruments detect
the signals from Mariner II and find out about galaxies a billion miles

<p class="p">The whole question of imagination in science is often misunderstood by
people in other disciplines. They try to test our imagination in the
following way. They say, “Here is a picture of some people in a
situation. What do you imagine will happen next?” When we say, “I
can’t imagine,” they may think we have a weak imagination. They
overlook the fact that whatever we are <em class="emph">allowed</em> to imagine in
science must be <em class="emph">consistent with everything else we know:</em> that the
electric fields and the waves we talk about are not just some happy
thoughts which we are free to make as we wish, but ideas which must be
consistent with all the laws of physics we know. We can’t allow
ourselves to seriously imagine things which are obviously in
contradiction to the known laws of nature. And so our kind of
imagination is quite a difficult game. One has to have the imagination
to think of something that has never been seen before, never been heard
of before. At the same time the thoughts are restricted in a strait
jacket, so to speak, limited by the conditions that come from our
knowledge of the way nature really is. The problem of creating something
which is new, but which is consistent with everything which has been
seen before, is one of extreme difficulty.

“Ooh, a rainbow.” (You see how scientific I am. I am afraid to say something
is beautiful unless I have an experimental way of defining it.) But how would we
describe a rainbow if we were blind? We <em class="emph">are</em> blind when we measure the
infrared reflection coefficient of sodium chloride, or when we talk about the
frequency of the waves that are coming from some galaxy that we can’t see—we
make a diagram, we make a plot. For instance, for the rainbow, such a plot would
be the intensity of radiation vs. wavelength measured with a
spectrophotometer for each direction in the sky. Generally, such measurements
would give a curve that was rather flat. Then some day, someone would discover
that for certain conditions of the weather, and at certain angles in the sky,
the spectrum of intensity as a function of wavelength would behave strangely; it
would have a bump. As the angle of the instrument was varied only a little bit,
the maximum of the bump would move from one wavelength to another. Then one day
the physical review of the blind men might publish a technical article with the
title “The Intensity of Radiation as a Function of Angle under Certain
Conditions of the Weather.” In this article there might appear a graph such as
the one in Fig. <a href="#Ch20-F5">20–5</a>. The author would perhaps remark that at the
larger angles there was more radiation at long wavelengths, whereas for the
smaller angles the maximum in the radiation came at shorter wavelengths. (From

<div id="Ch20-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We have seen that there are solutions of the wave equation which
correspond to plane waves, and that any electromagnetic wave can be
described as a superposition of many plane waves. In certain special
cases, however, it is more convenient to describe the wave field in a
different mathematical form. We would like to discuss now the theory
of spherical waves—waves which correspond to spherical surfaces that
are spreading out from some center. When you drop a stone into a lake,
the ripples spread out in circular waves on the surface—they are
two-dimensional waves. A spherical wave is a similar thing except that
it spreads out in three dimensions.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Before we start describing spherical waves, we need a little
mathematics. Suppose we have a function that depends only on the
radial distance $r$ from a certain origin—in other words, a function
that is spherically symmetric. Let’s call the function $\psi(r)$,
where by $r$ we mean
\begin{equation*}
r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2},
\end{equation*}

the radial distance from the origin. In order to find out what
functions $\psi(r)$ satisfy the wave equation, we will need an
expression for the Laplacian of $\psi$. So we want to find the sum of
the second derivatives of $\psi$ with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$. We
will use the notation that $\psi'(r)$ represents the derivative
of $\psi$ with respect to $r$ and $\psi''(r)$ represents the second
derivative of $\psi$ with respect to $r$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">First, we find the derivatives with respect to $x$. The first
derivative is
\begin{equation*}
\ddp{\psi(r)}{x}=\psi'(r)\,\ddp{r}{x}.
\end{equation*}

The second derivative of $\psi$ with respect to $x$ is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2}=
\psi''\biggl(\ddp{r}{x}\biggr)^2+
\psi'\,\frac{\partial^2r}{\partial x^2}.
\end{equation*}

We can evaluate the partial derivatives of $r$ with respect to $x$
from
\begin{equation*}
\ddp{r}{x}=\frac{x}{r},\quad
\frac{\partial^2r}{\partial x^2}=
\frac{1}{r}\biggl(1-\frac{x^2}{r^2}\biggr).
\end{equation*}

So the second derivative of $\psi$ with respect to $x$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:28}
\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2}=\frac{x^2}{r^2}\psi''+\frac{1}{r}\biggl(1-\frac{x^2}{r^2}\biggr)\psi'.

Likewise,
\begin{alignat}{3}
\label{Eq:II:20:29}
\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial y^2}&=
\frac{y^2}{r^2}\,&&\psi''+
\frac{1}{r}\biggl(1-\frac{y^2}{r^2}&&\biggr)\psi',\\[1.5ex]
\label{Eq:II:20:30}
\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial z^2}&=
\frac{z^2}{r^2}\,&&\psi''+
\frac{1}{r}\biggl(1-\frac{z^2}{r^2}&&\biggr)\psi'.
\end{alignat}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">The Laplacian is the sum of these three derivatives. Remembering that
$x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2$, we get

\nabla^2\psi(r)=\psi''(r)+\frac{2}{r}\,\psi'(r).
\end{equation}

It is often more convenient to write this equation in the following
form:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:32}
\nabla^2\psi(r)=\frac{1}{r}\,\frac{d^2}{dr^2}(r\psi).
\end{equation}

If you carry out the differentiation indicated in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2032">20.32</a>), you will see that the right-hand side is the

\frac{1}{r}\,\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}\,(r\psi)-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\,\psi=0.
\end{equation*}

</div>
<div id="Ch20-S4-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">We must now solve this equation, which appears to be much more
complicated than the plane wave case. But notice that if we multiply
this equation by $r$, we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:34}
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}\,(r\psi)-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\,(r\psi)=0.
\end{equation}

This equation tells us that the function $r\psi$ satisfies the
one-dimensional wave equation in the variable $r$. Using the general
principle which we have emphasized so often, that the same equations
always have the same solutions, we know that if $r\psi$ is a function
only of $(r-ct)$ then it will be a solution of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2034">20.34</a>).
So we know that spherical waves must have the form
\begin{equation*}
r\psi(r,t)=f(r-ct).
\end{equation*}

Or, as we have seen before, we can equally well say that $r\psi$ can
have the form
\begin{equation*}
r\psi=f(t-r/c).
\end{equation*}

Dividing by $r$, we find that the field quantity $\psi$ (whatever it
may be) has the following form:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:20:35}
\psi=\frac{f(t-r/c)}{r}.
\end{equation}

Such a function represents a general spherical wave travelling outward
from the origin at the speed $c$. If we forget about the $r$ in the
denominator for a moment, the amplitude of the wave as a function of
the distance from the origin at a given time has a certain shape that
travels outward at the speed $c$. The factor $r$ in the denominator,
however, says that the amplitude of the wave decreases in proportion
to $1/r$ as the wave propagates. In other words, unlike a plane wave
in which the amplitude remains constant as the wave runs along, in a
spherical wave the amplitude steadily decreases, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch20-F6">20–6</a>. This effect is easy to understand from a simple
physical argument.</p>

<p class="p">We know that the energy density in a wave depends on the square of the
wave amplitude. As the wave spreads, its energy is spread over larger
and larger areas proportional to the radial distance squared. If the
total energy is conserved, the energy density must fall as $1/r^2$,
and the amplitude of the wave must decrease as $1/r$. So
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2035">20.35</a>) is the “reasonable” form for a spherical wave.</p>

<p class="p">We have disregarded the second possible solution to the
one-dimensional wave equation:
\begin{equation*}
r\psi=g(t+r/c),
\end{equation*}

or
\begin{equation*}
\psi=\frac{g(t+r/c)}{r}.
\end{equation*}

This also represents a spherical wave, but one which travels
<em class="emph">inward</em> from large $r$ toward the origin.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S4-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">We are now going to make a special assumption. We say, without any
demonstration whatever, that the waves generated by a source are only
the waves which go <em class="emph">outward</em>. Since we know that waves are caused
by the motion of charges, we want to think that the waves proceed
outward from the charges. It would be rather strange to imagine that
before charges were set in motion, a spherical wave started out from
infinity and arrived at the charges just at the time they began to
move. That is a possible solution, but experience shows that when
charges are accelerated the waves travel outward from the
charges. Although Maxwell’s equations would allow either possibility,
we will put in an <em class="emph">additional fact</em>—based on experience—that
only the outgoing wave solution makes “physical sense.”</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S4-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">We should remark, however, that there is an interesting consequence to
this additional assumption: we are removing the symmetry with respect
to time that exists in Maxwell’s equations. The original equations for
$\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$, and also the wave equations we derived from them,
have the property that if we change the sign of $t$, the equation is
unchanged. These equations say that for every solution corresponding
to a wave going in one direction there is an equally valid solution
for a wave travelling in the opposite direction. Our statement that we
will consider only the outgoing spherical waves is an important
additional assumption. (A formulation of electrodynamics in which this
additional assumption is avoided has been carefully
studied. Surprisingly, in many circumstances it does <em class="emph">not</em> lead
to physically absurd conclusions, but it would take us too far astray
to discuss these ideas just now. We will talk about them a little more
in Chapter <a href="II_28.html">28</a>.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S4-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">We must mention another important point. In our solution for an
outgoing wave, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2035">20.35</a>), the function $\psi$ is
infinite at the origin. That is somewhat peculiar. We would like to
have a wave solution which is smooth everywhere. Our solution must
represent physically a situation in which there is some source at the
origin. In other words, we have inadvertently made a mistake. We have
not solved the free wave equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2033">20.33</a>)
<em class="emph">everywhere;</em> we have solved Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2033">20.33</a>) with zero
on the right everywhere, except at the origin. Our mistake crept in
because some of the steps in our derivation are not “legal”
when $r=0$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S4-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s show that it is easy to make the same kind of mistake in an
electrostatic problem. Suppose we want a solution of the equation for
an electrostatic potential in free space, $\nabla^2\phi=0$. The
Laplacian is equal to zero, because we are assuming that there are no
charges anywhere. But what about a spherically symmetric solution to
this equation—that is, some function $\phi$ that depends only
on $r$. Using the formula of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2032">20.32</a>) for the Laplacian,
we have
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{r}\,\frac{d^2}{dr^2}\,(r\phi)=0.
\end{equation*}

Multiplying this equation by $r$, we have an equation which is readily
integrated:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2}{dr^2}\,(r\phi)=0.
\end{equation*}

If we integrate once with respect to $r$, we find that the first
derivative of $r\phi$ is a constant, which we may call $a$:
\begin{equation*}
\ddt{}{r}\,(r\phi)=a.
\end{equation*}

Integrating again, we find that $r\phi$ is of the form
\begin{equation*}
r\phi=ar+b,
\end{equation*}

where $b$ is another constant of integration. So we have found that
the following $\phi$ is a solution for the electrostatic potential in
free space:
\begin{equation*}
\phi=a+\frac{b}{r}.
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch20-S4-p13" class="para">
<p class="p">Something is evidently wrong. In the region where there are no
electric charges, we know the solution for the electrostatic
potential: the potential is everywhere a constant. That corresponds to
the first term in our solution. But we also have the second term,
which says that there is a contribution to the potential that varies
as one over the distance from the origin. We know, however, that such
a potential corresponds to a point charge at the origin. So, although
we thought we were solving for the potential in free space, our
solution also gives the field for a point source at the origin. Do you
see the similarity between what happened now and what happened when we
solved for a spherically symmetric solution to the wave equation? If
there were really no charges or currents at the origin, there would
not be spherical outgoing waves. The spherical waves must, of course,
be produced by sources at the origin. In the next chapter we will
investigate the connection between the outgoing electromagnetic waves
and the currents and voltages which produce them.</p>
