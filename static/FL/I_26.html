                        <em class="emph">electromagnetic radiation</em>. Light, with which we
                        see, is only one small part of a vast spectrum of the same kind of
                        thing, the various parts of this spectrum being distinguished by
                        different values of a certain quantity which varies. This variable
                        quantity could be called the “wavelength.” As it
                        varies in the visible spectrum, the light apparently changes color from
                        red to violet. If we explore the spectrum systematically, from long
                        wavelengths toward shorter ones, we would begin with what are usually
                        called <em class="emph">radiowaves</em>. Radiowaves are technically available in a wide
                        range of wavelengths, some even longer than those used in regular
                        broadcasts; regular broadcasts have wavelengths corresponding to about
                        $500$ meters. Then there are the so-called “short waves,” i.e., radar
                        waves, millimeter waves, and so on. There are no actual boundaries
                        between one range of wavelengths and another, because nature did not
                        present us with sharp edges. The number associated with a given name for
                        the waves are only approximate and, of course, so are the names we give
                        to the different ranges.</p>

                        <p class="p">Then, a long way down through the millimeter waves, we come to what we
                        call the <em class="emph">infrared</em>, and thence to the visible
                        spectrum. Then going in the other direction, we get into a region which
                        is called the <em class="emph">ultraviolet</em>. Where the ultraviolet
                        stops, the x-rays begin, but we
                        cannot define precisely where this is; it is roughly at $10^{-8}$ m, or
                        $10^{-2}$ $\mu$m. These are “soft” x-rays; then there are ordinary
                        x-rays and very hard x-rays; then $\gamma$-rays, and so on, for smaller
                        and smaller values of this dimension called the wavelength.

                        <p class="p">Within this vast range of wavelengths, there are three or more regions
                        of approximation which are especially interesting. In one of these, a
                        condition exists in which the wavelengths involved are very small
                        compared with the dimensions of the equipment available for their
                        study; furthermore, the photon energies, using the quantum theory, are
                        small compared with the energy sensitivity of the equipment. Under
                        these conditions we can make a rough first approximation by a method
                        called <em class="emph">geometrical optics</em>. If, on the other hand, the
                        wavelengths are comparable to the dimensions of the equipment, which is
                        difficult to arrange with visible light but easier with radiowaves, and
                        if the photon energies are still negligibly small, then a very useful
                        approximation can be made by studying the behavior of the waves, still
                        disregarding the quantum mechanics. This method is based on the
                        <em class="emph">classical theory of electromagnetic radiation</em>, which will be
                        discussed in a later chapter. Next, if we go to very short wavelengths,
                        where we can disregard the wave character but the photons have a very
                        <em class="emph">large</em> energy compared with the sensitivity of our equipment,
                        things get simple again. This is the simple <em class="emph">photon</em> picture, which
                        we will describe only very roughly. The complete picture, which unifies
                        the whole thing into one model, will not be available to us for a long
                        time.</p>

                        character of the light, which will all be explained in due time. We do

                        <p class="p">First, light is, of course, familiar to everybody, and has been
                        familiar since time immemorial. Now one problem is, by what process do
                        we <em class="emph">see</em> light? There have been many theories, but it finally
                        settled down to one, which is that there is something which enters the
                        eye—which bounces off objects into the eye. We have heard that idea
                        so long that we accept it, and it is almost impossible for us to
                        realize that very intelligent men have proposed contrary
                        theories—that something comes out of the eye and feels for the
                        object, for example. Some other important observations are that, as
                        light goes from one place to another, it goes in <em class="emph">straight
                            lines</em>, if there is nothing in the way, and that the rays do not seem
                        to interfere with one another. That is, light is crisscrossing in all
                        directions in the room, but the light that is passing across our line
                        of vision does not affect the light that comes to us from some
                        object. This was once a most powerful argument against the corpuscular
                        theory; it was used by Huygens.
                        If light were like a lot of arrows shooting along, how could other
                        arrows go through them so easily? Such philosophical arguments are not
                        of much weight. One could always say that light is made up of arrows
                        which go through each other!</p>

                        <p class="p">The discussion above gives enough of the basic <em class="emph">idea</em> of
                        geometrical optics—now we have to go a little further into the
                        quantitative features. Thus far we have light going only in straight
                        lines between two points; now let us study the behavior of light when
                        it hits various materials. The simplest object is a mirror, and the
                        law for a mirror is that when the light hits the mirror, it does not
                        continue in a straight line, but bounces off the mirror into a new
                        straight line, which changes when we change the inclination of the
                        mirror. The question for the ancients was, what is the relation
                        between the two angles involved? This is a very simple relation,
                        discovered long ago. The light striking a mirror travels in such a way
                        that the two angles, between each beam and the mirror, are equal. For
                        some reason it is customary to measure the angles from the normal to
                        the mirror surface. Thus the so-called law of reflection is
                        \begin{equation}
                        \label{Eq:I:26:1}
                        \theta_i=\theta_r.
                        \end{equation}
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="Ch26-S2-p2" class="para">
                        <p class="p">That is a simple enough proposition, but a more difficult problem is
                        encountered when light goes from one medium into another, for example
                        from air into water; here also, we see that it does not go in a
                        straight line. In the water the ray is at an inclination to its path
                        in the air; if we change the angle $\theta_i$ so that it comes down
                        more nearly vertically, then the angle of “breakage” is not as
                        great. But if we tilt the beam of light at quite an angle, then the
                        deviation angle is very large.  The question is, what is the relation
                        of one angle to the other? This also puzzled the ancients for a long
                        time, and here they never found the answer! It is, however, one of the
                        few places in all of Greek physics that one may find any experimental
                        results listed. Claudius
                        Ptolemy
                        made a list of the angle in water for each of a number of
                        different angles in air. Table <a href="#Ch26-T1">26–1</a> shows the angles in the
                        air, in degrees, and the corresponding angle as measured in the water.
                        (Ordinarily it is said that Greek scientists never did any experiments.
                        But it would be impossible to obtain this table of values without
                        knowing the right law, except by experiment. It should be noted,
                        however, that these do not represent independent careful measurements
                        for each angle but only some numbers interpolated from a few
                        measurements, for they all fit perfectly on a parabola.)</p>

                        found the rule connecting the two angles! The rule, found by
                        Willebrord Snell, a Dutch
                        mathematician, is as follows: if $\theta_i$ is the angle in air and
                        $\theta_r$ is the angle in the water, then it turns out that the sine
                        of $\theta_i$ is equal to some constant multiple of the sine of $\theta_r$:
                        \begin{equation}
                        \label{Eq:I:26:2}
                        \sin\theta_i=n\sin\theta_r.
                        \end{equation}
                        For water the number $n$ is approximately $1.33$.

                        is this: that out of all possible paths that it might take to get from
                        one point to another, light takes the path which requires the

                        this simple principle contains both the law
                        of straight-line propagation and the law for the mirror. So, we are
                        growing in our understanding! Let us try to find the solution to the
                        following problem. In Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F3">26–3</a> are shown two points,
                        $A$ and $B$, and a plane mirror, $MM'$. What is the way to get from
                        $A$ to $B$ in the shortest time?  The answer is to go straight from
                        $A$ to $B$<span class="text italic">!</span> But if we add the extra rule that the light has
                        to <em class="emph">strike the mirror</em> and come back in the shortest time, the
                        answer is not so easy. One way would be to go as quickly as possible
                        to the mirror and then go to $B$, on the path $ADB$. Of course, we
                        then have a long path $DB$. If we move over a little to the right,
                        to $E$, we slightly increase the first distance, but we greatly
                        <em class="emph">decrease</em> the second one, and so the total path length, and
                        therefore the travel time, is less. How can we find the point $C$ for
                        which the time is the shortest? We can find it very nicely by a
                        geometrical trick.</p>

                        <p class="p">We construct on the other side of $MM'$ an artificial point $B'$,
                        which is the same distance below the plane $MM'$ as the point $B$ is
                        above the plane. Then we draw the line $EB'$. Now because $BFM$ is a
                        right angle and $BF = FB'$, $EB$ is equal to $EB'$. Therefore the sum
                        of the two distances, $AE + EB$, which is proportional to the time it
                        will take if the light travels with constant velocity, is also the sum
                        of the two lengths $AE + EB'$. Therefore the problem becomes, when is
                        the sum of these two lengths the least? The answer is easy: when the
                        line goes through point $C$ as a <em class="emph">straight line</em> from $A$
                        to $B'$! In other words, we have to find the point where we go toward the
                        artificial point, and that will be the correct one. Now if $ACB'$ is a
                        straight line, then angle $BCF$ is equal to angle $B'CF$ and thence to
                        angle $ACM$. Thus the statement that the angle of
                        incidence equals
                        the angle of reflection is equivalent to the
                        statement that the light goes to the mirror in such a way that it comes
                        back to the point $B$ in the <em class="emph">least possible time</em>. Originally, the
                        statement was made by Hero of Alexandria that the light travels in such
                        a way that it goes to the mirror and to the other point in the shortest
                        possible <em class="emph">distance</em>, so it is not a modern theory. It was this that
                        inspired Fermat to suggest to
                        himself that perhaps refraction operated on a similar basis. But for
                        refraction, light obviously does not use the path of shortest
                        <em class="emph">distance</em>, so Fermat tried
                        the idea that it takes the shortest <em class="emph">time</em>.</p>

                        <p class="p">Before we go on to analyze refraction, we should make one more remark
                        about the mirror. If we have a source of light at the point $B$ and it
                        sends light toward the mirror, then we see that the light which goes
                        to $A$ from the point $B$ comes to $A$ in exactly the same manner as
                        it would have come to $A$ if there were an object at $B'$, and
                        <em class="emph">no</em> mirror. Now of course the eye detects only the light which
                        enters it physically, so if we have an object at $B$ and a mirror
                        which makes the light come into the eye in exactly the same manner as
                        it would have come into the eye if the object were at $B'$, then the
                        eye-brain system interprets that, assuming it does not know too much,
                        as <em class="emph">being</em> an object at $B'$. So the illusion that there is an
                        object behind the mirror is merely due to the fact that the light
                        which is entering the eye is entering in exactly the same manner,
                        physically, as it would have entered had there <em class="emph">been</em> an object
                        back there (except for the dirt on the mirror, and our knowledge of
                        the existence of the mirror, and so on, which is corrected in the
                        brain).</p>

                        <p class="p">In Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F4">26–4</a>, our problem is again to go from $A$ to $B$
                        in <em class="emph">the shortest time</em>. To illustrate that the best thing to do
                        is not just to go in a straight line, let us imagine that a beautiful
                        girl has fallen out of a boat, and she is screaming for help in the
                        water at point $B$. The line marked $x$ is the shoreline. We are at
                        point $A$ on land, and we see the accident, and we can run and can
                        also swim. But we can run faster than we can swim. What do we do? Do
                        we go in a straight line? (Yes, no doubt!) However, by using a little
                        more intelligence we would realize that it would be advantageous to
                        travel a little greater distance on land in order to decrease the
                        distance in the water, because we go so much slower in the
                        water. (Following this line of reasoning out, we would say the right
                        thing to do is to <em class="emph">compute</em> very carefully what should be done!)
                        At any rate, let us try to show that the final solution to the problem
                        is the path $ACB$, and that this path takes the shortest time of all
                        possible ones. If it is the shortest path, that means that if we take
                        any other, it will be longer. So, if we were to plot the time it takes
                        against the position of point $X$, we would get a curve something like
                        that shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F5">26–5</a>, where point $C$ corresponds to
                        the shortest of all possible times. This means that if we move the
                        point $X$ to points <em class="emph">near</em> $C$, in the first approximation there
                        is essentially <em class="emph">no change</em> in time because the slope is zero at
                        the bottom of the curve. So our way of finding the law will be to
                        consider that we move the place by a very small amount, and to demand
                        that there be essentially no change in time. (Of course there is an
                        infinitesimal change of a <em class="emph">second</em> order; we ought to have a
                        positive increase for displacements in either direction from $C$.) So
                        we consider a nearby point $X$ and we calculate how long it would take
                        to go from $A$ to $B$ by the two paths, and compare the new path with
                        the old path. It is very easy to do. We want the difference, of
                        course, to be nearly zero if the distance $XC$ is short. First, look
                        at the path on land. If we draw a perpendicular $XE$, we see that this
                        path is shortened by the amount $EC$. Let us say we gain by not having
                        to go that extra distance. On the other hand, in the water, by drawing
                        a corresponding perpendicular, $CF$, we find that we have to go the
                        extra distance $XF$, and that is what we lose. Or, in <em class="emph">time</em>, we
                        gain the time it would have taken to go the distance $EC$, but we lose
                        the time it would have taken to go the distance $XF$. Those times must
                        be equal since, in the first approximation, there is to be no change
                        in time. But supposing that in the water the speed is $1/n$ times as
                        fast as in air, then we must have
                        \begin{equation}
                        \label{Eq:I:26:3}
                        EC=n\cdot XF.
                        \end{equation}
                        Therefore we see that when we have the right point, $X\!C\sin E\!X\!C =
                        n\cdot X\!C\sin X\!C\!F$ or, cancelling the common hypotenuse length $XC$
                        and noting that

                        \end{gather*}
                       </span>
                        we have
                        \begin{equation}
                        \label{Eq:I:26:4}
                        \sin\theta_i=n\sin\theta_r.
                        \end{equation}
                        So we see that to get from one point to another in the least time when
                        the ratio of speeds is $n$, the light should enter at such an angle
                        that the ratio of the sines of the angles $\theta_i$ and $\theta_r$ is
                        the ratio of the speeds in the two media.</p>

                        principle of least time. First is the
                        principle of reciprocity. If to go from $A$
                        to $B$ we have found the path of the least time, then to go in the
                        opposite direction (assuming that light goes at the same speed in any
                        direction), the shortest time will be the same path, and therefore, if
                        light can be sent one way, it can be sent the other way.

                        <p class="p">A third interesting phenomenon is the fact that when we see the sun
                        setting, it is already below the horizon! It does not <em class="emph">look</em> as
                        though it is below the horizon, but it is (Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F7">26–7</a>). The
                        earth’s atmosphere is thin at the top and dense at the bottom. Light
                        travels more slowly in air than it does in a vacuum, and so the light of
                        the sun can get to point $S$ beyond the horizon more quickly if, instead
                        of just going in a straight line, it avoids the dense regions where it
                        goes slowly by getting through them at a steeper tilt. When it appears
                        to go below the horizon, it is actually already well below the horizon.
                        Another example of this phenomenon is the mirage that one often sees
                        while driving on hot roads. One sees “water” on the road, but when he
                        gets there, it is as dry as the desert! The phenomenon is the following.
                        What we are really seeing is the sky light “reflected” on the road:
                        light from the sky, heading for the road, can end up in the eye, as
                        shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F8">26–8</a>. Why? The air is very hot just above
                        the road but it is cooler up higher. Hotter air is more expanded than
                        cooler air and is thinner, and this decreases the speed of light less.
                        That is to say, light goes faster in the hot region than in the cool
                        region. Therefore, instead of the light deciding to come in the
                        straightforward way, it also has a least-time path by which it goes into
                        the region where it goes faster for awhile, in order to save time. So,
                        it can go in a curve.</p>

                        situation where we have all the light that comes out of one point,
                        $P$, collected back together at another point, $P'$
                        (Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F9">26–9</a>). That means, of course, that the light can go in
                        a straight line from $P$ to $P'$. That is all right. But how can we
                        arrange that not only does it go straight, but also so that the light
                        starting out from $P$ toward $Q$ also ends up at $P'$? We want to bring
                        all the light back to what we call a <em class="emph">focus</em>. How? If the light
                        always takes the path of least time, then certainly it should not want
                        to go over all these other paths. The only way that the light can be
                        perfectly satisfied to take several adjacent paths is to make those
                        times <em class="emph">exactly equal!</em>  Otherwise, it would select the one of least
                        time. Therefore the problem of making a focusing system is merely to
                        arrange a device so that it takes the same time for the light to go on
                        <em class="emph">all</em> the different paths!</p>

                        light goes slower than it does in the air (Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F10">26–10</a>). Now
                        consider a ray which goes in air in the path $PQP'$. That is a longer
                        path than from $P$ directly to $P'$ and no doubt takes a longer time.
                        But if we were to insert a piece of glass of just the right thickness
                        (we shall later figure out how thick) it might exactly compensate the
                        excess time that it would take the light to go at an angle! In those
                        circumstances we can arrange that the time the light takes to go
                        straight through is the same as the time it takes to go in the
                        path $PQP'$. Likewise, if we take a ray $PRR'P'$ which is partly inclined, it
                        is not quite as long as $PQP'$, and we do not have to compensate as much
                        as for the straight one, but we do have to compensate somewhat. We end
                        up with a piece of glass that looks like Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F10">26–10</a>. With
                        this shape, all the light which comes from $P$ will go to $P'$. This, of
                        course, is well known to us, and we call such a device a converging
                        <em class="emph">lens</em>. In the next chapter we shall actually calculate what shape
                        the lens has to have to make a perfect focus.</p>

                        the light from $P$ always goes to $P'$ (Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F11">26–11</a>). On
                        any path, it goes to some mirror and comes back, and all times must be

                        distance are proportional. Therefore the statement that all the times
                        are the same is the same as the statement that the total distance is
                        the same. Thus the sum of the two distances $r_1$ and $r_2$ must be a

                        the sum of the distances from two points is a constant for every point
                        on the ellipse; thus we can be sure that the light from one focus will
                        come to the other.</p>

                        <p class="p">The same principle works for gathering the light of a star. The great
                        $200$-inch Palomar telescope is built on the following
                        principle. Imagine a star billions of miles away; we would like to
                        cause all the light that comes in to come to a focus. Of course we
                        cannot draw the rays that go all the way up to the star, but we still
                        want to check whether the times are equal. Of course we know that when
                        the various rays have arrived at some plane $KK'$, perpendicular to
                        the rays, all the times in this plane are equal
                        (Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F12">26–12</a>). The rays must then come down to the mirror and
                        proceed toward $P'$ in equal times. That is, we must find a curve which
                        has the property that the sum of the distances $XX' + X'P'$ is a
                        constant, no matter where $X$ is chosen. An easy way to find it is to
                        extend the length of the line $XX'$ down to a plane $LL'$. Now if we
                        arrange our curve so that $A'A'' = A'P'$, $B'B'' = B'P'$, $C'C'' =
                        C'P'$, and so on, we will have our curve, because then of course, $AA' +
                        A'P' = AA' + A'A''$ will be constant. Thus our curve is the locus of all
                        points equidistant from a line and a point. Such a curve is called a
                        <em class="emph">parabola</em>; the mirror is made in the shape of a parabola.</p>

                        theory. When a new theoretical principle is developed, such as the
                        principle of least time, our first
                        inclination might be to say, “Well, that is very pretty; it is
                        delightful; but the question is, does it help at all in understanding
                        the physics?” Someone may say, “Yes, look at how many things we can
                        now understand!” Another says, “Very well, but I can understand
                        mirrors, too. I need a curve such that every tangent plane makes equal
                        angles with the two rays. I can figure out a lens, too, because every
                        ray that comes to it is bent through an angle given by Snell’s
                        law.” Evidently the statement of least time
                        and the statement that angles are equal on reflection, and that the
                        sines of the angles are proportional on refraction, are the same. So is
                        it merely a philosophical question, or one of beauty?  There can be
                        arguments on both sides.

                        <p class="p">It is easy to show that there are a number of new things predicted by
                        Fermat’s principle. First, suppose that
                        there are <em class="emph">three</em> media, glass, water, and air, and we perform a
                        refraction experiment and measure the index $n$ for one medium against
                        another. Let us call $n_{12}$ the index of air ($1$) against water
                        ($2$); $n_{13}$ the index of air ($1$) against glass ($3$). If we
                        measured water against glass, we should find another index, which we
                        shall call $n_{23}$. But there is no <em class="emph">a priori</em> reason why there
                        should be any connection between $n_{12}$, $n_{13}$, and $n_{23}$. On
                        the other hand, according to the idea of least time, there <em class="emph">is</em> a
                        definite relationship. The index $n_{12}$ is the ratio of two things,
                        the speed in air to the speed in water; $n_{13}$ is the ratio of the
                        speed in air to the speed in glass; $n_{23}$ is the ratio of the speed
                        in water to the speed in glass. Therefore we cancel out the air, and
                        get
                        \begin{equation}
                        \label{Eq:I:26:5}
                        n_{23}=\frac{v_2}{v_3}=\frac{v_1/v_3}{v_1/v_2}=\frac{n_{13}}{n_{12}}.
                        \end{equation}
                        In other words, we <em class="emph">predict</em> that the index for a new pair of
                        materials can be obtained from the indexes of the individual
                        materials, both against air or against vacuum. So if we measure the
                        speed of light in all materials, and from this get a single number for
                        each material, namely its index relative to vacuum, called $n_i$
                        ($n_1$ is the speed in vacuum relative to the speed in air, etc.),
                        then our formula is easy. The index for any two materials $i$ and $j$
                        is
                        \begin{equation}
                        \label{Eq:I:26:6}
                        n_{ij}=\frac{v_i}{v_j}=\frac{n_j}{n_i}.
                        \end{equation}
                        Using only Snell’s law, there is no
                        basis for a prediction of this kind.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> But of course this prediction
                        works. The relation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI265">26.5</a>) was known very early, and was a
                        very strong argument for the principle of

                        a completely different type. It is a brilliant prediction, because all

                        prediction which is quite different from the observations from which
                        Fermat deduced the idea of least time. It
                        turns out, in fact, that the speed in water <em class="emph">is</em> slower than the
                        speed in air, by just the proportion that is needed to get the right

                        <p class="p">Actually, we must make the statement of the principle of least time a little more accurately. It was not stated
                        correctly above. It is <em class="emph">incorrectly</em> called the
                        principle of least time and we have gone
                        along with the incorrect description for convenience, but we must now
                        see what the correct statement is. Suppose we had a mirror as in
                        Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F3">26–3</a>. What makes the light think it has to go to
                        the mirror?  The path of <em class="emph">least</em> time is clearly $AB$. So some
                        people might say, “Sometimes it is a maximum time.” It is <em class="emph">not</em>
                        a maximum time, because certainly a curved path would take a still
                        longer time!  The correct statement is the following: a ray going in a
                        certain particular path has the property that if we make a small
                        change (say a one percent shift) in the ray in any manner whatever,
                        say in the location at which it comes to the mirror, or the shape of
                        the curve, or anything, there will be <em class="emph">no</em> first-order change in
                        the time; there will be only a <em class="emph">second</em>-order change in the
                        time. In other words, the principle is that
                        light takes a path such that there are many other paths nearby which
                        take almost exactly the <em class="emph">same</em> time.

                        <p class="p">The following is another difficulty with the principle of least time, and one which people who do not like this
                        kind of a theory could never stomach. With Snell’s theory we can
                        “understand” light. Light goes along, it sees a surface, it bends
                        because it does something at the surface. The idea of causality, that
                        it goes from one point to another, and another, and so on, is easy to
                        understand. But the principle of least time
                        is a completely different philosophical principle about the way nature
                        works. Instead of saying it is a causal thing, that when we do one
                        thing, something else happens, and so on, it says this: we set up the
                        situation, and <em class="emph">light</em> decides which is the shortest time, or the
                        extreme one, and chooses that path. But <em class="emph">what</em> does it do,
                        <em class="emph">how</em> does it find out? Does it <em class="emph">smell</em> the nearby paths,
                        and check them against each other? The answer is, yes, it does, in a
                        way. That is the feature which is, of course, not known in geometrical
                        optics, and which is involved in the idea of <em class="emph">wavelength</em>; the
                        wavelength tells us approximately how far away the light must
                        “smell” the path in order to check it. It is hard to demonstrate
                        this fact on a large scale with light, because the wavelengths are so
                        terribly short. But with radiowaves, say $3$-cm waves, the distances
                        over which the radiowaves are checking are larger. If we have a source
                        of radiowaves, a detector, and a slit, as in Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F13">26–13</a>,
                        the rays of course go from $S$ to $D$ because it is a straight line,
                        and if we close down the slit it is all right—they still go. But now
                        if we move the detector aside to $D'$, the waves will not go through
                        the wide slit from $S$ to $D'$, because they check several paths
                        nearby, and say, “No, my friend, those all correspond to different
                        times.”  On the other hand, if we <em class="emph">prevent</em> the radiation from
                        checking the paths by closing the slit down to a very narrow crack,
                        then there is but one path available, and the radiation takes it! With
                        a narrow slit, more radiation reaches $D'$ than reaches it with a wide
                        slit!</p>

                        a large scale. The effect can be seen under the following simple
                        conditions. Find a small, bright light, say an unfrosted bulb in a
                        street light far away or the reflection of the sun in a curved
                        automobile bumper. Then put two fingers in front of one eye, so as to
                        look through the crack, and squeeze the light to zero very gently. You
                        will see that the image of the light, which was a little dot before,
                        becomes quite elongated, and even stretches into a long line. The
                        reason is that the fingers are very close together, and the light
                        which is supposed to come in a straight line is spread out at an
                        angle, so that when it comes into the eye it comes in from several
                        directions. Also you will notice, if you are very careful, side
                        maxima, a lot of fringes along the edges too. Furthermore, the whole
                        thing is colored. All of this will be explained in due time, but for
                        the present it is a demonstration that light does not always go in
                        straight lines, and it is one that is very easily performed.</p>

                        quantum-dynamically accurate viewpoint, but of course only
                        qualitatively described. In following the light from $A$ to $B$ in
                        Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F3">26–3</a>, we find that the light does not seem to be in
                        the form of waves at all. Instead the rays seem to be made up of
                        photons, and they actually produce clicks in a photon counter, if we
                        are using one. The brightness of the light is proportional to the
                        average number of photons that come in per second, and what we
                        calculate is the <em class="emph">chance</em> that a photon gets from $A$ to $B$, say
                        by hitting the mirror. The <em class="emph">law</em> for that chance is the following
                        very strange one. Take any path and find the time for that path; then
                        make a complex number, or draw a little complex vector, $\rho
                        e^{i\theta}$, <em class="emph">whose angle $\theta$ is proportional to the
                            time</em>. The number of turns per second is the frequency of the
                        light. Now take another path; it has, for instance, a different time,
                        so the vector for it is turned through a different angle—the angle
                        being always proportional to the time. Take <em class="emph">all</em> the available
                        paths and add on a little vector for each one; then the answer is that
                        the chance of arrival of the photon is proportional to the square of
                        the length of the final vector, from the beginning to the end!</p>

                        <p class="p">Now let us show how this implies the principle of least time for a mirror. We consider all rays, all
                        possible paths $ADB$, $AEB$, $ACB$, etc., in Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F3">26–3</a>. The
                        path $ADB$ makes a certain small contribution, but the next path, $AEB$,
                        takes a quite different time, so its angle $\theta$ is quite different.
                        Let us say that point $C$ corresponds to minimum time, where if we
                        change the paths the times do not change. So for awhile the times do
                        change, and then they begin to change less and less as we get near
                        point $C$ (Fig. <a href="#Ch26-F14">26–14</a>). So the arrows which we have to add are
                        coming almost exactly at the same angle for awhile near $C$, and then
                        gradually the time begins to increase again, and the phases go around
                        the other way, and so on. Eventually, we have quite a tight knot. The
                        total probability is the distance from one end to the other, squared.
                        <em class="emph">Almost all of that accumulated probability occurs in the region
                            where all the arrows are in the same direction</em> (or in the same phase).
                        All the contributions from the paths which have very <em class="emph">different</em>
                        times as we change the path, cancel themselves out by pointing in
                        different directions. That is why, if we hide the extreme parts of the
                        mirror, it still reflects almost exactly the same, because all we did
                        was to take out a piece of the diagram inside the spiral ends, and that
                        makes only a very small change in the light. So this is the relationship
                        between the ultimate picture of photons with a probability of arrival
                        depending on an accumulation of arrows, and the principle of least time.
