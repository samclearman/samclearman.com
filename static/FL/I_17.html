                        <p class="p">The theory of relativity
                        shows us that the relationships of positions and times as measured in
                        one coordinate system and another are not what we would have expected on
                        the basis of our intuitive ideas. It is very important that we
                        thoroughly understand the relations of space and time implied by the
                        Lorentz transformation, and therefore we shall consider this matter more

                        relates measurements in two systems, one of which in this instance is

                        In this particular case, Moe and Joe are measuring with axes having an
                        angle $\theta$ between the $x'$- and $x$-axes. In each case, we note
                        that the “primed” quantities are “mixtures” of the “unprimed”
                        ones: the new $x'$ is a mixture of $x$ and $y$, and the new $y'$ is also
                        a mixture of $x$ and $y$.</p>

                        <p class="p">An analogy is useful: When we look at an object, there is an obvious
                        thing we might call the “apparent width,” and another we might call
                        the “depth.” But the two ideas, width and depth, are not
                        <em class="emph">fundamental</em> properties of the object, because if we step aside
                        and look at the same thing from a different angle, we get a different
                        width and a different depth, and we may develop some formulas for
                        computing the new ones from the old ones and the angles involved.
                        Equations (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI172">17.2</a>) are these formulas. One might say that a
                        given depth is a kind of “mixture” of all depth and all width. If it
                        were impossible ever to move, and we always saw a given object from the
                        same position, then this whole business would be irrelevant—we would
                        always see the “true” width and the “true” depth, and they would
                        appear to have quite different qualities, because one appears as a
                        subtended optical angle and the other involves some focusing of the eyes
                        or even intuition; they would seem to be very different things and would
                        never get mixed up. It is because we <em class="emph">can</em> walk around that we
                        realize that depth and width are, somehow or other, just two different
                        aspects of the same thing.</p>

                        Here also we have a mixture—of positions and the time. A difference
                        between a space measurement and a time measurement produces a new space
                        measurement. In other words, in the space measurements of one man there
                        is mixed in a little bit of the time, as seen by the other. Our analogy
                        permits us to generate this idea: The “reality” of an object that we
                        are looking at is somehow greater (speaking crudely and intuitively)
                        than its “width” and its “depth” because <em class="emph">they</em> depend upon
                        <em class="emph">how</em> we look at it; when we move to a new position, our brain
                        immediately recalculates the width and the depth. But our brain does not
                        immediately recalculate coordinates and time when we move at high speed,
                        because we have had no effective experience of going nearly as fast as
                        light to appreciate the fact that time and space are also of the same
                        nature. It is as though we were always stuck in the position of having
                        to look at just the width of something, not being able to move our heads
                        appreciably one way or the other; if we could, we understand now, we
                        would see some of the other man’s time—we would see “behind,” so to
                        speak, a little bit.</p>

                        <p class="p">Thus we shall try to think of objects in a new kind of world, of space
                        and time mixed together, in the same sense that the objects in our
                        ordinary space-world are real, and can be looked at from different
                        directions. We shall then consider that objects occupying space and
                        lasting for a certain length of time occupy a kind of a “blob” in a
                        new kind of world, and that we look at this “blob” from different
                        points of view when we are moving at different velocities. This new
                        world, this geometrical entity in which the “blobs” exist by occupying
                        position and taking up a certain amount of time, is called
                        <em class="emph">space-time</em>. A given point $(x,y,z,t)$ in space-time is called an
                        <em class="emph">event</em>. Imagine, for example, that we plot the $x$-positions
                        horizontally, $y$ and $z$ in two other directions, both mutually at
                        “right angles” and at “right angles” to the paper (!), and time,
                        vertically. Now, how does a moving particle, say, look on such a
                        diagram? If the particle is standing still, then it has a certain $x$,
                        and as time goes on, it has the same $x$, the same $x$, the same $x$; so
                        its “path” is a line that runs parallel to the $t$-axis
                        (Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F1">17–1</a> a). On the other hand, if it drifts outward, then
                        as the time goes on $x$ increases (Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F1">17–1</a> b). So a
                        particle, for example, which starts to drift out and then slows up
                        should have a motion something like that shown in
                        Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F1">17–1</a>(c). A particle, in other words, which is permanent
                        and does not disintegrate is represented by a line in space-time. A
                        particle which disintegrates would be represented by a forked line,
                        because it would turn into two other things which would start from that
                        point.</p>

                        occurred at a certain value of $x$ and a certain value of $t$, then we
                        would expect that, if this makes any sense, we just have to take a new
                        pair of axes and turn them, and that will give us the new $t$ and the
                        new $x$ in our new system, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F2">17–2</a>(a). But
                        this is wrong, because Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI171">17.1</a>) is not <em class="emph">exactly</em> the
                        same mathematical transformation as Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI172">17.2</a>). Note, for
                        example, the difference in sign between the two, and the fact that one
                        is written in terms of $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$, while the other is
                        written with algebraic quantities. (Of course, it is not impossible that
                        the algebraic quantities could be written as cosine and sine, but
                        actually they cannot.) But still, the two expressions <em class="emph">are</em> very
                        similar. As we shall see, it is not really possible to think of
                        space-time as a real, ordinary geometry because of that difference in
                        sign. In fact, although we shall not emphasize this point, it turns out
                        that a man who is moving has to use a set of axes which are inclined
                        equally to the light ray, using a special kind of projection parallel to
                        the $x'$- and $t'$-axes, for his $x'$ and $t'$, as shown in
                        Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F2">17–2</a>(b). We shall not deal with the geometry, since it
                        does not help much; it is easier to work with the equations.</p>

                        <p class="p">Although the geometry of space-time is not Euclidean in the ordinary sense, there <em class="emph">is</em> a geometry which is
                        very similar, but peculiar in certain respects. If this idea of geometry
                        is right, there ought to be some functions of coordinates and time which
                        are independent of the coordinate system. For example, under ordinary
                        rotations, if we take two points, one at the origin, for simplicity, and
                        the other one somewhere else, both systems would have the same origin,
                        and the distance from here to the other point is the same in both. That
                        is one property that is independent of the particular way of measuring
                        it. The square of the distance is $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. Now what about
                        space-time? It is not hard to demonstrate that we have here, also,
                        something which stays the same, namely, the combination $c^2t^2 - x^2 -
                        y^2 - z^2$ is the same before and after the transformation:
                        \begin{equation}
                        \label{Eq:I:17:3}
                        c^2t'^2\!-x'^2\!-y'^2\!-z'^2\!=c^2t^2\!-x^2\!-y^2\!-z^2\!.
                        \end{equation}
                        This quantity is therefore something which, like the distance, is
                        “real” in some sense; it is called the <em class="emph">interval</em> between the two
                        space-time points, one of which is, in this case, at the origin.
                        (Actually, of course, it is the interval squared, just as $x^2 + y^2 +
                        z^2$ is the distance squared.) We give it a different name because it is
                        in a different geometry, but the interesting thing is only that some
                        signs are reversed and there is a $c$ in it.</p>

                        <p class="p">Let us get rid of the $c$; that is an absurdity if we are going to have
                        a wonderful space with $x$’s and $y$’s that can be interchanged. One of
                        the confusions that could be caused by someone with no experience would
                        be to measure widths, say, by the angle subtended at the eye, and
                        measure depth in a different way, like the strain on the muscles needed
                        to focus them, so that the depths would be measured in feet and the
                        widths in meters. Then one would get an enormously complicated mess of
                        equations in making transformations such as (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI172">17.2</a>), and would
                        not be able to see the clarity and simplicity of the thing for a very
                        simple technical reason, that the same thing is being measured in two
                        different units. Now in Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI171">17.1</a>)
                        and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI173">17.3</a>) nature is telling us that time and space are
                        equivalent; time becomes space; <em class="emph">they should be measured in the
                            same units</em>. What distance is a “second”? It is easy to figure out
                        from (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI173">17.3</a>) what it is. It is $3\times10^8$ meters, <em class="emph">the
                            distance that light would go in one second</em>. In other words, if we were
                        to measure all distances and times in the same units, seconds, then our
                        unit of distance would be $3\times10^8$ meters, and the equations would
                        be simpler. Or another way that we could make the units equal is to
                        measure time in meters. What is a meter of time? A meter of time is the
                        time it takes for light to go one meter, and is therefore
                        $1/3\times10^{-8}$ sec, or $3.3$ billionths of a second! We would like,
                        in other words, to put all our equations in a system of units in
                        which $c = 1$. If time and space are measured in the same units, as
                        suggested, then the equations are obviously much simplified. They are
                        \begin{gather}
                        \label{Eq:I:17:4}
                        \begin{aligned}
                        x'&=\frac{x-ut}{\sqrt{1-u^2}},\\
                        y'&=y,\\[1.5ex]
                        z'&=z,\\
                        t'&=\frac{t-ux}{\sqrt{1-u^2}}.
                        \end{aligned}\\[2.25ex]
                        \label{Eq:I:17:5}
                        t'^2\!-x'^2\!-y'^2\!-z'^2\!=t^2\!-x^2\!-y^2\!-z^2\!.
                        \end{gather}
                        If we are ever unsure or “frightened” that after we have this system
                        with $c=1$ we shall never be able to get our equations right again, the
                        answer is quite the opposite. It is much easier to remember them without
                        the $c$’s in them, and it is always easy to put the $c$’s back, by
                        looking after the dimensions. For instance, in $\sqrt{1 - u^2}$, we know
                        that we cannot subtract a velocity squared, which has units, from the
                        pure number $1$, so we know that we must divide $u^2$ by $c^2$ in order
                        to make that unitless, and that is the way it goes.</p>

                        <p class="p">The difference between space-time and ordinary space, and the character
                        of an interval as related to the distance, is very interesting.
                        According to formula (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI175">17.5</a>), if we consider a point which in
                        a given coordinate system had zero time, and only space, then the
                        interval squared would be negative and we would have an imaginary
                        interval, the square root of a negative number. Intervals can be either
                        real or imaginary in the theory. The square of an interval may be either
                        positive or negative, unlike distance, which has a positive square. When
                        an interval is imaginary, we say that the two points have a
                        <em class="emph">space-like interval</em> between them (instead of imaginary), because
                        the interval is more like space than like time. On the other hand, if
                        two objects are at the same place in a given coordinate system, but
                        differ only in time, then the square of the time is positive and the
                        distances are zero and the interval squared is positive; this is called
                        a <em class="emph">time-like interval</em>. In our diagram of space-time, therefore, we
                        would have a representation something like this: at $45^\circ$ there are
                        two lines (actually, in four dimensions these will be “cones,” called
                        light cones) and points on these lines are all at zero
                        interval from the origin. Where light goes from a given point is always
                        separated from it by a zero interval, as we see from
                        Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI175">17.5</a>). Incidentally, we have just proved that if light
                        travels with speed $c$ in one system, it travels with speed $c$ in
                        another, for if the interval is the same in both systems, i.e., zero in
                        one and zero in the other, then to state that the propagation speed of
                        light is invariant is the same as saying that the interval is zero.

                        separated into three regions, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F3">17–3</a>. In one
                        region we have space-like intervals, and in two regions, time-like
                        intervals. Physically, these three regions into which space-time around
                        a given point is divided have an interesting physical relationship to
                        that point: a physical object or a signal can get from a point in
                        region $2$ to the event $O$ by moving along at a speed less than the
                        speed of light. Therefore events in this region can affect the
                        point $O$, can have an influence on it from the past. In fact, of
                        course, an object at $P$ on the negative $t$-axis is precisely in the
                        “past” with respect to $O$; it is the same space-point as $O$, only
                        earlier. What happened there then, affects $O$ now. (Unfortunately, that
                        is the way life is.) Another object at $Q$ can get to $O$ by moving with
                        a certain speed less than $c$, so if this object were in a space ship
                        and moving, it would be, again, the past of the same space-point. That
                        is, in another coordinate system, the axis of time might go through both
                        $O$ and $Q$. So all points of region $2$ are in the “past” of $O$, and
                        anything that happens in this region <em class="emph">can</em> affect $O$. Therefore
                        region $2$ is sometimes called the <em class="emph">affective past</em>, or affecting past; it is the locus of all events which can affect
                        point $O$ in any way.</p>

                        have affected it if we had done something far enough in the past. When
                        we look at the star Alpha Centauri, we see it as it was four years ago;
                        we might wonder what it is like “now.” “Now” means at the same time
                        from our special coordinate system. We can only see Alpha Centauri by
                        the light that has come from our past, up to four years ago, but we do
                        not know what it is doing “now”; it will take four years before what
                        it is doing “now” can affect us. Alpha Centauri “now” is an idea or
                        concept of our mind; it is not something that is really definable
                        physically at the moment, because we have to wait to observe it; we
                        cannot even define it right “now.” Furthermore, the “now” depends on
                        the coordinate system. If, for example, Alpha Centauri were moving, an
                        observer there would not agree with us because he would put his axes at
                        an angle, and his “now” would be a <em class="emph">different</em> time. We have

                        utility of collecting together other quantities which have the same
                        transformation properties as the coordinates, to form what we call

                        are many quantities that transform the same way as $x$, $y$, and $z$
                        under rotation: for example, the velocity has three components, an
                        $x$, $y$, and $z$-component; when seen in a different coordinate system,
                        none of the components is the same, instead they are all transformed to
                        new values. But, somehow or other, the velocity “itself” has a greater
                        reality than do any of its particular components, and we represent it by
                        a directed line.

                        which transform, or which are related, in a moving system and in a
                        nonmoving system, in the same way as $x$, $y$, $z$, and $t$? From our
                        experience with vectors, we know that three of the quantities, like $x$,
                        $y$, $z$, would constitute the three components of an ordinary
                        space-vector, but the fourth quantity would look like an ordinary scalar
                        under space rotation, because it does not change so long as we do not go
                        into a moving coordinate system. Is it possible, then, to associate with
                        some of our known “three-vectors” a fourth object, that we could call
                        the “time component,” in such a manner that the four objects together
                        would “rotate” the same way as position and time in space-time? We
                        shall now show that there is, indeed, at least one such thing (there are
                        many of them, in fact): <em class="emph">the three components of momentum, and the
                            energy as the time component, transform together</em> to make what we call a
                        “four-vector.” In demonstrating this, since it is quite inconvenient
                        to have to write $c$’s everywhere, we shall use the same trick
                        concerning units of the energy, the mass, and the momentum, that we used
                        in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI174">17.4</a>). Energy and mass, for example, differ only by a
                        factor $c^2$ which is merely a question of units, so we can say energy
                        <i>is</i> the mass. Instead of having to write the $c^2$, we put $E = m$, and
                        then, of course, if there were any trouble we would put in the right
                        amounts of $c$ so that the units would straighten out in the last
                        equation, but not in the intermediate ones.</p>

                        <p class="p">Now what would the momentum and energy look like in a new coordinate
                        system? To find out, we shall have to transform Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI176">17.6</a>),
                        which we can do because we know how the velocity transforms. Suppose
                        that, as we measure it, an object has a velocity $v$, but we look upon
                        the same object from the point of view of a space ship which itself is
                        moving with a velocity $u$, and in that system we use a prime to
                        designate the corresponding thing. In order to simplify things at first,
                        we shall take the case that the velocity $v$ is in the direction of $u$.
                        (Later, we can do the more general case.)  What is $v'$, the velocity as
                        seen from the space ship? It is the composite velocity, the
                        “difference” between $v$ and $u$. By the law which we worked out
                        before,
                        \begin{equation}
                        \label{Eq:I:17:8}
                        v'=\frac{v-u}{1-uv}.
                        \end{equation}
                        Now let us calculate the new energy $E'$, the energy as the fellow in
                        the space ship would see it. He would use the same rest mass, of course,
                        but he would use $v'$ for the velocity. What we have to do is
                        square $v'$, subtract it from one, take the square root, and take the
                        reciprocal:
                        \begin{equation*}
                        \begin{aligned}
                        v'^2&=\frac{v^2-2uv+u^2}{1-2uv+u^2v^2},\\[1.5ex]

                        for the four-vector, and $\mu$ stands for the <em class="emph">four</em> possible

                        is $t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2$ (Eq. <a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI173">17.3</a>). How can we write that?
                        One way would be to write some kind of four-dimensional thing with a
                        square dot between, like $A_\mu \boxdot B_\mu$; one of the notations
                        which is actually used is
                        \begin{equation}
                        \label{Eq:I:17:15}
                        \sideset{}{'}\sum_\mu A_\mu A_\mu=A_t^2-A_x^2-A_y^2-A_z^2.
                        \end{equation}
                        The prime on $\sum$ means that the first term, the “time” term, is
                        positive, but the other three terms have minus signs. This quantity,
                        then, will be the same in any coordinate system, and we may call it the
                        square of the length of the four-vector. For instance, what is the
                        square of the length of the four-vector momentum of a single particle?
                        This will be equal to $p_t^2 - p_x^2 - p_y^2 - p_z^2$ or, in other
                        words, $E^2 - p^2$, because we know that $p_t$ is $E$. What is $E^2 -
                        p^2$? It must be something which is the same in every coordinate system.
                        In particular, it must be the same for a coordinate system which is
                        moving right along with the particle, in which the particle is standing
                        still. If the particle is standing still, it would have no momentum. So
                        in that coordinate system, it is purely its energy, which is the same as
                        its rest mass. Thus $E^2 - p^2 = m_0^2$. So we see that the square of
                        the length of this vector, the four-vector momentum, is equal
                        to $m_0^2$.</p>

                        and $b_\mu$ is another four-vector, then the scalar product is

                        <p class="p">Finally, we shall mention certain things whose rest mass $m_0$ is zero.
                        A photon of light, for example. A photon is
                        like a particle, in that it carries an energy and a momentum. The energy
                        of a photon is a certain constant, called Planck’s
                        constant, times the frequency of the
                        photon: $E = h\nu$. Such a photon also carries a momentum,
                        and the momentum of a photon (or of any other particle, in
                        fact) is $h$ divided by the wavelength: $p = h/\lambda$. But, for a
                        photon, there is a definite relationship between the frequency and the
                        wavelength: $\nu= c/\lambda$. (The number of waves per second, times the
                        wavelength of each, is the distance that the light goes in one second,
                        which, of course, is $c$.)  Thus we see immediately that the energy of a
                        photon must be the momentum times $c$, or if $c = 1$, <em class="emph">the energy
                            and momentum are equal</em>. That is to say, the rest mass is zero. Let us
                        look at that again; that is quite curious. If it is a particle of zero
                        rest mass, what happens when it stops? <em class="emph">It never stops!</em> It always
                        goes at the speed $c$. The usual formula for energy is $m_0/\sqrt{1 -
                        v^2}$. Now can we say that $m_0 = 0$ and $v = 1$, so the energy is $0$?
                        We <em class="emph">cannot</em> say that it is zero; the photon really can (and does)
                        have energy even though it has no rest mass, but this it possesses by
                        perpetually going at the speed of light!</p>

                        <p class="p">We also know that the momentum of any particle is equal to its total
                        energy times its velocity: if $c = 1$, $p = vE$ or, in ordinary units,
                        $p = vE/c^2$. For any particle moving at the speed of light, $p = E$ if
                        $c = 1$. The formulas for the energy of a photon as seen from a moving
                        system are, of course, given by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI1712">17.12</a>), but for the
                        momentum we must substitute the energy times $c$ (or times $1$ in this
                        case). The different energies after transformation means that there are
                        different frequencies. This is called the Doppler
                        effect, and one can calculate it easily
                        from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI1712">17.12</a>), using also $E = p$ and $E = h\nu$.
