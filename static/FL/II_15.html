<span class="tag">15–1</span>The forces on a current loop; energy of a dipole</h3>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In the last chapter we studied the magnetic field produced by a small
rectangular current loop. We found that it is a dipole field, with the
dipole moment given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:1}
\mu=IA,
\end{equation}

where $I$ is the current and $A$ is the area of the loop. The
direction of the moment is normal to the plane of the loop, so we can
also write
\begin{equation*}
\FLPmu=IA\FLPn,
\end{equation*}

where $\FLPn$ is the unit normal to the area $A$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">A current loop—or magnetic dipole—not only produces magnetic
fields, but will also experience forces when placed in the magnetic
field of other currents. We will look first at the forces on a
rectangular loop in a uniform magnetic field. Let the $z$-axis be
along the direction of the field, and the plane of the loop be placed
through the $y$-axis, making the angle $\theta$ with the $xy$-plane as
in Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F1">15–1</a>. Then the magnetic moment of the loop—which is normal
to its plane—will make the angle $\theta$ with the magnetic field.</p>

<span class="tag">Fig. 15–1.</span>A rectangular loop carrying the current $I$ sits in a uniform
field $\FigB$ (in the $z$-direction). The torque on the loop
is $\Figtau=\Figmu\times\FigB$, where the magnetic moment $\mu=Iab$.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Since the currents are opposite on opposite sides of the loop, the
forces are also opposite, so there is no net force on the loop (when
the field is uniform). Because of forces on the two sides marked $1$
and $2$ in the figure, however, there is a torque which tends to
rotate the loop about the $y$-axis. The magnitude of these forces
$F_1$ and $F_2$ is
\begin{equation*}
F_1=F_2=IBb.
\end{equation*}

Their moment arm is
\begin{equation*}
a\sin\theta,
\end{equation*}

so the torque is

\begin{equation*}
\tau=IabB\sin\theta.
\end{equation*}

or, since $Iab$ is the magnetic moment of the loop,

\begin{equation*}
\tau=\mu B\sin\theta.
\end{equation*}

The torque can be written in vector notation:

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:2}
\FLPtau=\FLPmu\times\FLPB.
\end{equation}

Although we have only shown that the torque is given by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII152">15.2</a>)
in one rather special case, the result is right for a small loop of any shape,
as we will see. The same kind of relationship holds for the torque of an electric dipole
in an electric field:

\begin{equation*}
\FLPtau=\FLPp\times\FLPE.
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch15-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We now ask about the mechanical energy of our current loop. Since there is a torque,
the energy evidently depends on the orientation. The principle of virtual work says that
the torque is the rate of change of energy with angle, so we can write

\begin{equation*}
dU=\tau\,d\theta.
\end{equation*}

Setting $\tau=\mu B\sin\theta$, and integrating, we can write for the energy

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:3}
U=-\mu B\cos\theta+\text{a constant}.
\end{equation}

(The sign is negative because the torque tries to line up the moment with the field;
the energy is lowest when $\FLPmu$ and $\FLPB$ are parallel.)</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch15-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">For reasons which we will discuss later, this energy is <em class="emph">not</em> the total energy of
a current loop. (We have, for one thing, not taken into account the energy required to
maintain the current in the loop.) We will, therefore, call this energy $U_{\text{mech}}$,
to remind us that it is only part of the energy. Also, since we are leaving out some of
energy anyway, we can set the constant of integration equal to zero in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII153">15.3</a>).
So we rewrite the equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:4}
U_{\text{mech}}=-\FLPmu\cdot\FLPB.
\end{equation}

Again, this corresponds to the result for an electric dipole:

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:5}
U=-\FLPp\cdot\FLPE.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Now the electrostatic energy $U$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII155">15.5</a>) is the
true energy, but $U_{\text{mech}}$ in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII154">15.4</a>) is not the
real energy. It <em class="emph">can</em>, however, be used in computing forces, by
the principle of virtual work, supposing that the current in the
loop—or at least $\mu$—is kept constant.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">We can show for our rectangular loop that $U_{\text{mech}}$ also
corresponds to the mechanical work done in bringing the loop into the
field. The total force on the loop is zero only in a uniform field; in
a nonuniform field there <em class="emph">are</em> net forces on a current loop. In
putting the loop into a region with a field, we must have gone through
places where the field was not uniform, and so work was done. To make
the calculation simple, we shall imagine that the loop is brought into
the field with its moment pointing along the field. (It can be rotated
to its final position after it is in place.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Imagine that we want to move the loop in the $x$-direction—toward a
region of stronger field—and that the loop is oriented as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F2">15–2</a>. We start somewhere where the field is zero and integrate
the force times the distance as we bring the loop into the field.</p>

<span class="tag">Fig. 15–2.</span>A loop is carried along the $x$-direction through the
field $\FigB$, at right angles to $x$.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">First, let’s compute the work done on each side separately and then
take the sum (rather than adding the forces before integrating). The
forces on sides $3$ and $4$ are at right angles to the direction of
motion, so no work is done on them. The force on side $2$ is $IbB(x)$
in the $x$-direction, and to get the work done against the magnetic
forces we must integrate this from some $x$ where the field is zero,
say at $x=-\infty$, to $x_2$, its present position:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:6}
W_2=-\int_{-\infty}^{x_2}F_2\,dx=-Ib\int_{-\infty}^{x_2}B(x)\,dx.
\end{equation}

Similarly, the work done against the forces on side $1$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:7}
W_1=-\int_{-\infty}^{x_1}F_1\,dx=Ib\int_{-\infty}^{x_1}B(x)\,dx.
\end{equation}

To find each integral, we need to know how $B(x)$ depends on $x$. But
notice that side $1$ follows along right behind side $2$, so that its
integral includes most of the work done on side $2$. In fact, the sum
of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII156">15.6</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII157">15.7</a>) is just
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:8}
W=-Ib\int_{x_1}^{x_2}B(x)\,dx.
\end{equation}

But if we are in a region where $B$ is nearly the same on both sides
$1$ and $2$, we can write the integral as
\begin{equation*}
\int_{x_1}^{x_2}B(x)\,dx=(x_2-x_1)B=aB,
\end{equation*}

where $B$ is the field at the center of the loop. The total mechanical
energy we have put in is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:9}
U_{\text{mech}}=W=-Iab\,B=-\mu B.
\end{equation}

The result agrees with the energy we took for Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII154">15.4</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">We would, of course, have gotten the same result if we had added the
forces on the loop before integrating to find the work. If we
let $B_1$ be the field at side $1$ and $B_2$ be the field at side $2$,
then the total force in the $x$-direction is
\begin{equation*}
F_x=Ib(B_2-B_1).
\end{equation*}

If the loop is “small,” that is, if $B_2$ and $B_1$ are not too
different, we can write
\begin{equation*}
B_2=B_1+\ddp{B}{x}\,\Delta x=B_1+\ddp{B}{x}\,a.\notag
\end{equation*}

So the force is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:10}
F_x=Iab\,\ddp{B}{x}.
\end{equation}

The total work done on the loop by <em class="emph">external</em> forces is
\begin{equation*}
-\int_{-\infty}^xF_x\,dx=-Iab\int\ddp{B}{x}\,dx=-IabB,
\end{equation*}

which is again just $-\mu B$. Only now we see why it is that the
<em class="emph">force</em> on a small current loop is proportional to the derivative
of the magnetic field, as we would expect from
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:11}
F_x\,\Delta x=-\Delta U_{\text{mech}}=-\Delta(-\FLPmu\cdot\FLPB).
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">Our result, then, is that even though $U_{\text{mech}}=-\FLPmu\cdot\FLPB$
may not include all the energy of
a system—it is a fake kind of energy—it can still be used with the
principle of virtual work to find the forces on steady current loops.</p>

<div id="Ch15-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We want now to show why the energy $U_{\text{mech}}$ discussed in the
previous section is not the correct energy associated with steady
currents—that it does not keep track of the total energy in the
world. We have, indeed, emphasized that it can be used like the
energy, for computing forces from the principle of virtual work,
<em class="emph">provided</em> that the current in the loop (and all <em class="emph">other</em>
currents) do not change. Let’s see why all this works.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Imagine that the loop in Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F2">15–2</a> is moving in the
$+x$-direction and take the $z$-axis in the direction of $\FLPB$. The
conduction electrons in side $2$ will experience a force along the wire,
in the $y$-direction. But because of their flow—as an electric
current—there is a component of their motion in the same direction as
the force. Each electron is, therefore, having work done on it at the
rate $F_yv_y$, where $v_y$, is the component of the electron velocity
along the wire. We will call this work done on the electrons
<em class="emph">electrical</em> work. Now it turns out that if the loop is moving in a
<em class="emph">uniform</em> field, the total electrical work is zero, since positive
work is done on some parts of the loop and an equal amount of negative
work is done on other parts. But this is not true if the circuit is
moving in a nonuniform field—then there <em class="emph">will</em> be a net amount of
work done on the electrons. In general, this work would tend to change
the flow of the electrons, but if the current is being held constant,
energy must be absorbed or delivered by the battery or other source that
is keeping the current steady. This energy was not included when we
computed $U_{\text{mech}}$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII159">15.9</a>), because our
computations included only the mechanical forces on the body of the
wire.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">You may be thinking: But the force on the electrons depends on how
<em class="emph">fast</em> the wire is moved; perhaps if the wire is moved slowly
enough this electrical energy can be neglected. It is true that the
<em class="emph">rate</em> at which the electrical energy is delivered is
proportional to the speed of the wire, but the <em class="emph">total</em> energy
delivered is proportional also to the <em class="emph">time</em> that this rate goes
on. So the total electrical energy is proportional to the velocity
times the time, which is just the distance moved. For a given
distance moved in a field the same amount of electrical work is done.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s consider a segment of wire of unit length carrying the
current $I$ and moving in a direction perpendicular to itself and to a
magnetic field $\FLPB$ with the speed $v_{\text{wire}}$. Because of
the current the electrons will have a drift velocity $v_{\text{drift}}$
along the wire. The component of the magnetic force
on each electron in the direction of the drift is $q_ev_{\text{wire}}B$.
So the rate at which electrical work is being
done is $Fv_{\text{drift}}=(q_ev_{\text{wire}}B)v_{\text{drift}}$. If
there are $N$ conduction electrons in the unit length of the wire, the
total rate at which electrical work is being done is
\begin{equation*}
\ddt{U_{\text{elect}}}{t}=Nq_ev_{\text{wire}}Bv_{\text{drift}}.
\end{equation*}

But $Nq_ev_{\text{drift}}=I$, the current in the wire, so
\begin{equation*}
\ddt{U_{\text{elect}}}{t}=Iv_{\text{wire}}B.
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now since the current is held constant, the forces on the conduction
electrons do not cause them to accelerate; the electrical energy is
not going into the electrons but into the source that is keeping the
current constant.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">But notice that the force on the <em class="emph">wire</em> is $IB$, so
$IBv_{\text{wire}}$ is also the rate of <em class="emph">mechanical work</em> done on

the mechanical work done on the wire is just equal to the electrical
work done on the current source, so the energy of the loop <em class="emph">is a

<div id="Ch15-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">This is not a coincidence, but a consequence of the law we already

The rate at which work is done is
\begin{equation}

U=\tfrac{1}{2}\int\rho\phi\,dV.

So we may if we wish think of $\FLPA$ as a kind of potential for
currents in magnetostatics. Unfortunately, this idea is not too
useful, because it is true only for static fields. In fact, neither of
the equations (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1520">15.20</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1521">15.21</a>) gives the
correct energy when the fields change with time.</p>

<div id="Ch15-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In this section we would like to discuss the following questions: Is
the vector potential merely a device which is useful in making
calculations—as the scalar potential is useful in
electrostatics—or is the vector potential a “real” field? Isn’t
the magnetic field the “real” field, because it is responsible for
the force on a moving particle? First we should say that the phrase
“a real field” is not very meaningful. For one thing, you probably
don’t feel that the magnetic field is very “real” anyway, because
even the whole idea of a field is a rather abstract thing. You cannot
put out your hand and feel the magnetic field. Furthermore, the value
of the magnetic field is not very definite; by choosing a suitable
moving coordinate system, for instance, you can make a magnetic field
at a given point disappear.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">What we mean here by a “real” field is this: a real field is a
mathematical function we use for avoiding the idea of action at a
distance. If we have a charged particle at the position $P$, it is
affected by other charges located at some distance from $P$. One way
to describe the interaction is to say that the other charges make some
“condition”—whatever it may be—in the environment at $P$. If we
know that condition, which we describe by giving the electric and
magnetic fields, then we can determine completely the behavior of the
particle—with no further reference to how those conditions came
about.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">In other words, if those other charges were altered in some way, but
the conditions at $P$ that are described by the electric and magnetic
field at $P$ remain the same, then the motion of the charge will also
be the same. A “real” field is then a set of numbers we specify in
such a way that what happens <em class="emph">at a point</em> depends only on the
numbers <em class="emph">at that point</em>. We do not need to know any more about
what’s going on at other places. It is in this sense that we will
discuss whether the vector potential is a “real” field.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">You may be wondering about the fact that the vector potential is not
unique—that it can be changed by adding the gradient of any scalar
with no change at all in the forces on particles. That has not,
however, anything to do with the question of reality in the sense that
we are talking about. For instance, the magnetic field is in a sense
altered by a relativity change (as are also $\FLPE$ and $\FLPA$). But
we are not worried about what happens if the field <em class="emph">can</em> be
changed in this way. That doesn’t really make any difference; that has
nothing to do with the question of whether the vector potential is a
proper “real” field for describing magnetic effects, or whether it
is just a useful mathematical tool.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We should also make some remarks on the usefulness of the vector
potential $\FLPA$. We have seen that it can be used in a formal
procedure for calculating the magnetic fields of known currents, just
as $\phi$ can be used to find electric fields. In electrostatics we
saw that $\phi$ was given by the scalar integral
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:22}
\phi(1)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO}\int\frac{\rho(2)}{r_{12}}\,dV_2.
\end{equation}

From this $\phi$, we get the three components of $\FLPE$ by three
differential operations. This procedure is usually easier to handle
than evaluating the three integrals in the vector formula
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:23}
\FLPE(1)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO}\int\frac{\rho(2)\FLPe_{12}}{r_{12}^2}\,dV_2.
\end{equation}

First, there are three integrals; and second, each integral is in
general somewhat more difficult.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S4-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">The advantages are much less clear for magnetostatics. The integral
for $\FLPA$ is already a vector integral:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:24}
\FLPA(1)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO c^2}\int
\frac{\FLPj(2)\,dV_2}{r_{12}},
\end{equation}

which is, of course, three integrals. Also, when we take the curl
of $\FLPA$ to get $\FLPB$, we have six derivatives to do and combine by
pairs. It is not immediately obvious whether in most problems this
procedure is really any easier than computing $\FLPB$ directly from
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:25}
\FLPB(1)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO c^2}\int
\frac{\FLPj(2)\times\FLPe_{12}}{r_{12}^2}\,dV_2.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S4-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Using the vector potential is often more difficult for simple problems
for the following reason. Suppose we are interested only in the
magnetic field $\FLPB$ at one point, and that the problem has some
nice symmetry—say we want the field at a point on the axis of a ring
of current. Because of the symmetry, we can easily get $\FLPB$ by
doing the integral of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1525">15.25</a>). If, however, we were
to find $\FLPA$ first, we would have to compute $\FLPB$ from
<em class="emph">derivatives</em> of $\FLPA$, so we must know what $\FLPA$ is at all
points in the <em class="emph">neighborhood</em> of the point of interest. And most
of these points are off the axis of symmetry, so the integral
for $\FLPA$ gets complicated. In the ring problem, for example, we would
need to use elliptic integrals. In such problems, $\FLPA$ is clearly
not very useful. It is true that in many complex problems it is easier
to work with $\FLPA$, but it would be hard to argue that this ease of
technique would justify making you learn about one more vector field.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S4-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">We have introduced $\FLPA$ because it <em class="emph">does</em> have an important
physical significance. Not only is it related to the energies of
currents, as we saw in the last section, but it is also a “real”
physical field in the sense that we described above. In classical
mechanics it is clear that we can write the force on a particle as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:26}
\FLPF=q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB),
\end{equation}

so that, given the forces, everything about the motion is
determined. In any region where $\FLPB=\FLPzero$ even if $\FLPA$ is
not zero, such as outside a solenoid, there is no discernible effect
of $\FLPA$. Therefore for a long time it was believed that $\FLPA$ was
not a “real” field. It turns out, however, that there are phenomena
involving quantum mechanics which show that the field $\FLPA$ is in
fact a “real” field in the sense we have defined it. In the next
section we will show you how that works.</p>

<span class="tag">15–5</span>The vector potential and quantum mechanics</h3>
<div id="Ch15-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">There are many changes in what concepts are important when we go from
classical to quantum mechanics. We have already discussed some of them
in Vol. I. In particular, the force concept gradually fades away,
while the concepts of energy and momentum become of paramount
importance. You remember that instead of particle motions, one deals
with probability amplitudes which vary in space and time. In these
amplitudes there are wavelengths related to momenta, and frequencies
related to energies. The momenta and energies, which determine the
phases of wave functions, are therefore the important quantities in
quantum mechanics. Instead of forces, we deal with the way
interactions change the wavelength of the waves. The idea of a force
becomes quite secondary—if it is there at all. When people talk
about nuclear forces, for example, what they usually analyze and work
with are the energies of interaction of two nucleons, and not the
force between them. Nobody ever differentiates the energy to find out
what the force looks like. In this section we want to describe how the
vector and scalar potentials enter into quantum mechanics. It is, in
fact, just because momentum and energy play a central role in quantum
mechanics that $\FLPA$ and $\phi$ provide the most direct way of
introducing electromagnetic effects into quantum descriptions.</p>

<span class="tag">Figure 15-5.</span>An interference experiment with electrons (see also
Chapter <a href="I_37.html">37</a> of Vol. I).
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We must review a little how quantum mechanics works. We will consider
again the imaginary experiment described in Chapter <a href="I_37.html">37</a>
of Vol. I, in which electrons are diffracted by two slits. The
arrangement is shown again in Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F5">15–5</a>. Electrons, all of nearly
the same energy, leave the source and travel toward a wall with two
narrow slits. Beyond the wall is a “backstop” with a movable
detector. The detector measures the rate, which we call $I$, at which
electrons arrive at a small region of the backstop at the distance $x$
from the axis of symmetry. The rate is proportional to the probability
that an individual electron that leaves the source will reach that
region of the backstop. This probability has the complicated-looking
distribution shown in the figure, which we understand as due to the
interference of two amplitudes, one from each slit. The interference
of the two amplitudes depends on their phase difference. That is, if
the amplitudes are $C_1e^{i\Phi_1}$ and $C_2e^{i\Phi_2}$, the phase
difference $\delta=\Phi_1-\Phi_2$ determines their interference
pattern [see Eq. (<a href="I_29.html#mjx-eqn-EqI2912">29.12</a>) in Vol. I]. If the distance
between the screen and the slits is $L$, and if the difference in the
path lengths for electrons going through the two slits is $a$, as
shown in the figure, then the phase difference of the two waves is
given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:27}
\delta=\frac{a}{\lambdabar}.
\end{equation}

As usual, we let $\lambdabar=\lambda/2\pi$, where $\lambda$ is the
wavelength of the space variation of the probability amplitude. For
simplicity, we will consider only values of $x$ much less than $L$;
then we can set
\begin{equation}
a=\frac{x}{L}\,d\notag
\end{equation}

and
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:28}
\delta=\frac{x}{L}\,\frac{d}{\lambdabar}.
\end{equation}

When $x$ is zero, $\delta$ is zero; the waves are in phase, and the
probability has a maximum. When $\delta$ is $\pi$, the waves are out
of phase, they interfere destructively, and the probability is a
minimum. So we get the wavy function for the electron intensity.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we would like to state the law that for quantum mechanics replaces
the force law $\FLPF=q\FLPv\times\FLPB$. It will be the law that
determines the behavior of quantum-mechanical particles in an
electromagnetic field. Since what happens is determined by amplitudes,
the law must tell us how the magnetic influences affect the
amplitudes; we are no longer dealing with the acceleration of a
particle. The law is the following: the phase of the amplitude to
arrive via any trajectory is changed by the presence of a magnetic
field by an amount equal to the integral of the vector potential along
the whole trajectory times the charge of the particle over
Planck’s constant. That is,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:29}
\text{Magnetic change in phase}=\frac{q}{\hbar}\kern{-2ex}
\underset{\text{trajectory}}{\int}\kern{-2ex}\FLPA\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation}

If there were no magnetic field there would be a certain phase of
arrival. If there is a magnetic field anywhere, the phase of the
arriving wave is increased by the integral in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1529">15.29</a>).
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Although we will not need to use it for our present discussion, we
mention that the effect of an electrostatic field is to produce a
phase change given by the <em class="emph">negative</em> of the <em class="emph">time</em> integral
of the scalar potential $\phi$:
\begin{equation*}
\text{Electric change in phase}=-\frac{q}{\hbar}\int\phi\,dt.
\end{equation*}

These two expressions are correct not only for static fields, but
together give the correct result for <em class="emph">any</em> electromagnetic field,
static or dynamic. This is the law that
replaces $\FLPF=q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB)$. We want now, however, to consider
only a static magnetic field.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S5-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose that there is a magnetic field present in the two-slit
experiment. We want to ask for the phase of arrival at the screen of
the two waves whose paths pass through the two slits. Their
interference determines where the maxima in the probability will
be. We may call $\Phi_1$ the phase of the wave along
trajectory $(1)$. If $\Phi_1(B=0)$ is the phase without the magnetic field, then
when the field is turned on the phase will be
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:30}
\Phi_1=\Phi_1(B=0)+\frac{q}{\hbar}
\int_{(1)}\FLPA\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation}

Similarly, the phase for trajectory $(2)$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:31}
\Phi_2=\Phi_2(B=0)+\frac{q}{\hbar}
\int_{(2)}\FLPA\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation}

The interference of the waves at the detector depends on the phase
difference
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:32}
\delta=\Phi_1(B=0)-\Phi_2(B=0)+

\end{equation}
</span>
The no-field difference we will call $\delta(B=0)$; it is just the
phase difference we have calculated above in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1528">15.28</a>).
Also, we notice that the two integrals can be written as <em class="emph">one</em>
integral that goes forward along $(1)$ and back along $(2)$; we call
this the closed path $(1–2)$. So we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:33}
\delta=\delta(B=0)+\frac{q}{\hbar}
\oint_{(1–2)}\FLPA\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation}

This equation tells us how the electron motion is changed by the
magnetic field; with it we can find the new positions of the intensity
maxima and minima at the backstop.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S5-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Before we do that, however, we want to raise the following interesting
and important point. You remember that the vector potential function
has some arbitrariness. Two different vector potential functions
$\FLPA$ and $\FLPA'$ whose difference is the gradient of some scalar
function $\FLPgrad{\psi}$, both represent the same magnetic field,
since the curl of a gradient is zero. They give, therefore, the same
classical force $q\FLPv\times\FLPB$. If in quantum mechanics the
effects depend on the vector potential, <em class="emph">which</em> of the many
possible $\FLPA$-functions is correct?</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S5-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">The answer is that the same arbitrariness in $\FLPA$ continues to
exist for quantum mechanics. If in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1533">15.33</a>) we
change $\FLPA$ to $\FLPA'=\FLPA+\FLPgrad{\psi}$, the integral on $\FLPA$
becomes
\begin{equation*}
\oint_{(1–2)}\FLPA'\cdot d\FLPs=
\oint_{(1–2)}\FLPA\cdot d\FLPs+
\oint_{(1–2)}\FLPgrad{\psi}\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation*}

The integral of $\FLPgrad{\psi}$ is around the <em class="emph">closed</em>
path $(1–2)$, but the integral of the tangential component of a
gradient on a closed path is always zero, by Stokes’
theorem. Therefore both $\FLPA$ and $\FLPA'$ give the same phase
differences and the same quantum-mechanical interference effects. In
both classical and quantum theory it is only the curl of $\FLPA$ that
matters; any choice of the function of $\FLPA$ which has the correct
curl gives the correct physics.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S5-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">The same conclusion is evident if we use the results of
Section <a href="II_14.html#Ch14-S1">14–1</a>. There we found that the line integral
of $\FLPA$ around a closed path is the flux of $\FLPB$ through the path,
which here is the flux between paths $(1)$ and $(2)$.
Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1533">15.33</a>) can, if we wish, be written as
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}

of the normal component of $\FLPB$. The result depends only
on $\FLPB$, and therefore only on the curl of $\FLPA$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S5-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Now because we can write the result in terms of $\FLPB$ as well as in
terms of $\FLPA$, you might be inclined to think that the $\FLPB$
holds its own as a “real” field and that the $\FLPA$ can still be
thought of as an artificial construction. But the definition of
“real” field that we originally proposed was based on the idea that
a “real” field would not act on a particle from a distance. We can,
however, give an example in which $\FLPB$ is zero—or at least
arbitrarily small—at any place where there is some chance to find
the particles, so that it is not possible to think of it acting
<em class="emph">directly</em> on them.</p>

the phase difference proportional to the circulation of $\FLPA$
outside the solenoid, which will mean that the pattern of maxima and

difficult experiment. Because the wavelength of the electrons is so
small, the apparatus must be on a tiny scale to observe the
interference. The slits must be very close together, and that means
that one needs an exceedingly small solenoid. It turns out that in
certain circumstances, iron crystals will grow in the form of very
long, microscopically thin filaments called whiskers. When these iron
whiskers are magnetized they are like a tiny solenoid, and there is no
field outside except near the ends. The electron interference

<p class="p">This subject has an interesting history. The theory we have described
was known from the beginning of quantum mechanics in 1926. The fact that
the vector potential appears in the wave equation of quantum mechanics
(called the Schrödinger equation) was obvious from the day it was written. That it cannot be
replaced by the magnetic field in any easy way was observed by one man
after the other who tried to do so. This is also clear from our example
of electrons moving in a region where there is no field and being
affected nevertheless. But because in classical mechanics $\FLPA$ did
not appear to have any direct importance and, furthermore, because it
could be changed by adding a gradient, people repeatedly said that the
vector potential had no direct physical significance—that only the
magnetic and electric fields are “right” even in quantum mechanics. It
seems strange in retrospect that no one thought of discussing this
experiment until 1956, when Bohm and
Aharonov first suggested it and made
the whole question crystal clear. The implication was there all the
time, but no one paid attention to it. Thus many people were rather
shocked when the matter was brought up. That’s why someone thought it
would be worth while to do the experiment to see that it really was
right, even though quantum mechanics, which had been believed for so
many years, gave an unequivocal answer. It is interesting that something
like this can be around for thirty years but, because of certain
prejudices of what is and is not significant, continues to be ignored.</p>

classical formula—to show why it turns out that if we look at things
on a large enough scale it will look as though the particles are acted
on by a force equal to $q\FLPv\times{}$ the curl of $\FLPA$. To get
classical mechanics from quantum mechanics, we need to consider cases
in which all the wavelengths are very small compared with distances
over which external conditions, like fields, vary appreciably. We
shall not prove the result in great generality, but only in a very
simple example, to show how it works. Again we consider the same slit
experiment. But instead of putting all the magnetic field in a very
tiny region between the slits, we imagine a magnetic field that
extends over a larger region behind the slits, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F8">15–8</a>. We will take the idealized case where we have a
magnetic field which is uniform in a narrow strip of width $w$,
considered small as compared with $L$. (That can easily be arranged; the
backstop can be put as far out as we want.) In order to calculate the
shift in phase, we must take the two integrals of $\FLPA$ along the two
trajectories $(1)$ and $(2)$. They differ, as we have seen, merely by
the flux of $\FLPB$ between the paths. To our approximation, the flux
is $Bwd$. The phase difference for the two paths is then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:37}
\delta=\delta(B=0)+\frac{q}{\hbar}\,Bwd.
\end{equation}

We note that, to our approximation, the phase shift is independent of
the angle. So again the effect will be to shift the whole pattern
upward by an amount $\Delta x$. Using Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1535">15.35</a>),
\begin{equation*}
\Delta x=-\frac{L\lambdabar}{d}\,\Delta\delta=
-\frac{L\lambdabar}{d}\,[\delta-\delta(B=0)].
\end{equation*}

Using (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1537">15.37</a>) for $\delta-\delta(B=0)$,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:38}
\Delta x=-L\lambdabar\,\frac{q}{\hbar}\,Bw.
\end{equation}

Such a shift is equivalent to deflecting all the trajectories by the
small angle $\alpha$ (see Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F8">15–8</a>), where
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:39}
\alpha=\frac{\Delta x}{L}=-\frac{\lambdabar}{\hbar}\,qBw.
\end{equation}

<div id="Ch15-S5-p17" class="para">
<p class="p">Now classically we would also expect a thin strip of magnetic field to
deflect all trajectories through some small angle, say $\alpha'$, as
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F9">15–9</a>(a). As the electrons go through the magnetic
field, they feel a transverse force $q\FLPv\times\FLPB$ which lasts
for a time $w/v$. The change in their transverse momentum is just
equal to this impulse, so
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:40}
\Delta p_x=-qwB.
\end{equation}

The angular deflection [Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F9">15–9</a>(b)] is equal to the ratio of this
transverse momentum to the total momentum $p$. We get that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:15:41}
\alpha'=\frac{\Delta p_x}{p}=-\frac{qwB}{p}.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S5-p18" class="para">
<p class="p">We can compare this result with Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1539">15.39</a>), which gives
the same quantity computed quantum-mechanically. But the connection
between classical mechanics and
quantum mechanics is this: A particle of momentum $p$ corresponds to a
quantum amplitude varying with the
wavelength $\lambdabar=\hbar/p$. With this equality, $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ are
identical; the classical and quantum calculations give the same
result.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S5-p19" class="para">
<p class="p">From the analysis we see how it is that the vector potential which
appears in quantum mechanics in an explicit form produces a classical
force which depends only on its derivatives. In quantum mechanics what
matters is the interference between nearby paths; it always turns out
that the effects depend only on how much the field $\FLPA$
<em class="emph">changes</em> from point to point, and therefore only on the
derivatives of $\FLPA$ and not on the value itself. Nevertheless, the
vector potential $\FLPA$ (together with the scalar potential $\phi$
that goes with it) appears to give the most direct description of the
physics. This becomes more and more apparent the more deeply we go
into the quantum theory. In the general theory of quantum
electrodynamics, one takes the vector and scalar potentials as the
fundamental quantities in a set of equations that replace the Maxwell
equations:
$\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$ are slowly disappearing from the modern expression
of physical laws; they are being replaced by $\FLPA$ and $\phi$.

<div id="Ch15-S6-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We are now at the end of our exploration of the subject of static
fields. Already in this chapter we have come perilously close to
having to worry about what happens when fields change with time. We
were barely able to avoid it in our treatment of magnetic energy by
taking refuge in a relativistic argument. Even so, our treatment of
the energy problem was somewhat artificial and perhaps even
mysterious, because we ignored the fact that moving coils must, in
fact, produce changing fields. It is now time to take up the treatment
of time-varying fields—the subject of electrodynamics. We will do so
in the next chapter. First, however, we would like to emphasize a few
points.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Although we began this course with a presentation of the complete and
correct equations of electromagnetism, we immediately began to study
some incomplete pieces—because that was easier. There is a great
advantage in starting with the simpler theory of static fields, and
proceeding only later to the more complicated theory which includes
dynamic fields. There is less new material to learn all at once, and
there is time for you to develop your intellectual muscles in
preparation for the bigger task.</p>

<div id="Ch15-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">But there is the danger in this process that before we get to see the
complete story, the incomplete truths learned on the way may become
ingrained and taken as the whole truth—that what is true and what is
only sometimes true will become confused. So we give in
Table <a href="#Ch15-T1">15–1</a> a summary of the important formulas we have
covered, separating those which are true in general from those which are
true for statics, but false for dynamics. This summary also shows, in
part, where we are going, since as we treat dynamics we will be
developing in detail what we must just state here without proof.</p>

<p class="p">It may be useful to make a few remarks about the table. First, you
should notice that the equations we started with are the <em class="emph">true</em>
equations—we have not misled you there. The electromagnetic force
(often called the <em class="emph">Lorentz force</em>) $\FLPF=q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB)$ is <em class="emph">true</em>. It is only
Coulomb’s law that is false, to be used only for statics. The four
Maxwell equations for $\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$ are also true. The equations we took
for statics are false, of course, because we left off all terms with
time derivatives.

<div id="Ch15-S6-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Gauss’ law, $\FLPdiv{\FLPE}=\rho/\epsO$, remains, but the curl
of $\FLPE$ is <em class="emph">not</em> zero in general. So $\FLPE$ cannot always be
equated to the gradient of a scalar—the electrostatic potential. We
will see that a scalar potential still remains, but it is a
time-varying quantity that must be used together with vector
potentials for a complete description of the electric field. The
equations governing this new scalar potential are, necessarily, also
new.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S6-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">We must also give up the idea that $\FLPE$ is zero in conductors. When
the fields are changing, the charges in conductors do not, in general,
have time to rearrange themselves to make the field zero. They are set
in motion, but never reach equilibrium. The only general statement is:
electric fields in conductors produce currents. So in varying fields a
conductor is <em class="emph">not</em> an equipotential. It also follows that the
idea of a capacitance is no longer precise.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S6-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Since there are no magnetic charges, the divergence of $\FLPB$ is
<em class="emph">always</em> zero. So $\FLPB$ can always be equated
to $\FLPcurl{\FLPA}$. (Everything doesn’t change!) But the generation
of $\FLPB$ is not only from currents; $\FLPcurl{\FLPB}$ is proportional
to the current density <em class="emph">plus</em> a new term $\ddpl{\FLPE}{t}$. This
means that $\FLPA$ is related to currents by a new equation. It is
also related to $\phi$. If we make use of our freedom to
choose $\FLPdiv{\FLPA}$ for our own convenience, the equations for
$\FLPA$ or $\phi$ can be arranged to take on a simple and elegant form. We
therefore make the condition that $c^2\FLPdiv{\FLPA}=-\ddpl{\phi}{t}$,
and the differential equations for $\FLPA$ or $\phi$ appear as shown
in the table.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S6-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">The potentials $\FLPA$ and $\phi$ can still be found by integrals over
the currents and charges, but not the <em class="emph">same</em> integrals as for
statics. Most wonderfully, though, the true integrals are like the
static ones, with only a small and physically appealing
modification. When we do the integrals to find the potentials at some
point, say point $(1)$ in Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F10">15–10</a>, we must use the values of
$\FLPj$ and $\rho$ at the point $(2)$ <em class="emph">at an earlier
time</em> $t'=t-r_{12}/c$. As you would expect, the influences propagate from
point $(2)$ to point $(1)$ at the speed $c$. With this small change,
one can solve for the fields of varying currents and charges, because
once we have $\FLPA$ and $\phi$, we get $\FLPB$ from
$\FLPcurl{\FLPA}$, as before, and $\FLPE$ from
$-\FLPgrad{\phi}-\ddpl{\FLPA}{t}$.</p>

electrodynamics as well as for statics. You should not be misled into
thinking that this is at all “natural.” The validity of any formula
derived in the static case must be demonstrated over again for the
dynamic case. A contrary example is the expression for the
