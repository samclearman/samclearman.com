<div id="Ch6-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">This chapter will describe the behavior of the electric field in a
number of different circumstances. It will provide some experience
with the way the electric field behaves, and will describe some of the
mathematical methods which are used to find this field.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We begin by pointing out that the whole mathematical problem is the
solution of two equations, the Maxwell equations for electrostatics:
\begin{align}
\label{Eq:II:6:1}
\FLPdiv{\FLPE}&=\frac{\rho}{\epsO},\\[1ex]
\label{Eq:II:6:2}
\FLPcurl{\FLPE}&=\FLPzero.
\end{align}

In fact, the two can be combined into a single equation. From the
second equation, we know at once that we can describe the field as the
gradient of a scalar (see Section <a href="II_03.html#Ch3-S7">3–7</a>):
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:3}
\FLPE=-\FLPgrad{\phi}.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We may, if we wish, completely describe any particular electric field in terms
of its potential $\phi$. We obtain the differential equation that $\phi$ must
obey by substituting Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII63">6.3</a>) into (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII61">6.1</a>), to get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:4}
\FLPdiv{\FLPgrad{\phi}}=-\frac{\rho}{\epsO}.
\end{equation}

The divergence of the gradient of $\phi$ is the same as $\nabla^2$
operating on $\phi$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:5}
\FLPdiv{\FLPgrad{\phi}}=\nabla^2\phi=
\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial x^2}+
\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial y^2}+
\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial z^2},
\end{equation}

so we write Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII64">6.4</a>) as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:6}
\nabla^2\phi=-\frac{\rho}{\epsO}.
\end{equation}

The operator $\nabla^2$ is called the Laplacian, and
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII66">6.6</a>) is called the Poisson
equation. The entire subject of
electrostatics, from a mathematical point of view, is merely a study of
the solutions of the single equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII66">6.6</a>). Once $\phi$ is
obtained by solving Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII66">6.6</a>) we can find $\FLPE$
immediately from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII63">6.3</a>).

<div id="Ch6-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We take up first the special class of problems in which $\rho$ is
given as a function of $x$, $y$, $z$. In that case the problem is
almost trivial, for we already know the solution of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII66">6.6</a>) for the general case. We have shown that if $\rho$
is known at every point, the potential at point $(1)$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:7}
\phi(1)=\int\frac{\rho(2)\,dV_2}{4\pi\epsO r_{12}},
\end{equation}

where $\rho(2)$ is the charge density, $dV_2$ is the volume element at
point $(2)$, and $r_{12}$ is the distance between points $(1)$
and $(2)$. The solution of the <em class="emph">differential</em>
equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII66">6.6</a>) is reduced to an <em class="emph">integration</em> over
space. The solution (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII67">6.7</a>) should be especially noted,
because there are many situations in physics that lead to equations like
\begin{equation*}
\nabla^2(\text{something})=(\text{something else}),
\end{equation*}

and Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII67">6.7</a>) is a prototype of the solution for any of
these problems.</p>

We are not going to write out the formula for the electric field, but
we can always calculate it once we have the potential. So we have
solved the problem of two charges.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">There is an important special case in which the two charges are very
close together—which is to say that we are interested in the fields
only at distances from the charges large in comparison with their
separation. We call such a close pair of charges a
<em class="emph">dipole</em>. Dipoles are very common.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">A “dipole” antenna can often be approximated by two charges
separated by a small distance—if we don’t ask about the field too
close to the antenna. (We are usually interested in antennas with

apply, but for some purposes they are an adequate approximation.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">More important perhaps, are atomic dipoles. If there is an electric
field in any material, the electrons and protons feel opposite forces
and are displaced relative to each other. In a conductor, you
remember, some of the electrons move to the surfaces, so that the
field inside becomes zero. In an insulator the electrons cannot move
very far; they are pulled back by the attraction of the nucleus. They
do, however, shift a little bit. So although an atom, or molecule,
remains neutral in an external electric field, there is a very tiny
separation of its positive and negative charges and it becomes a
microscopic dipole. If we are interested in the fields of these atomic
dipoles in the neighborhood of ordinary-sized objects, we are normally
dealing with distances large compared with the separations of the
pairs of charges.</p>

<div id="Ch6-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">In some molecules the charges are somewhat separated even in the
absence of external fields, because of the form of the molecule. In a
water molecule, for example, there is a net negative charge on the
oxygen atom and a net positive charge on each of the two hydrogen
atoms, which are not placed symmetrically but as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6–2</a>. Although the charge of the whole molecule is
zero, there is a charge distribution with a little more negative charge
on one side and a little more positive charge on the other. This
arrangement is certainly not as simple as two point charges, but when
seen from far away the system acts like a dipole.  As we shall see a
little later, the field at large distances is not sensitive to the fine
details.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s look, then, at the field of two opposite charges with a small
separation $d$. If $d$ becomes zero, the two charges are on top of
each other, the two potentials cancel, and there is no field. But if
they are not exactly on top of each other, we can get a good
approximation to the potential by expanding the terms
of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII68">6.8</a>) in a power series in the small quantity $d$ (using
the binomial expansion). Keeping terms only to first order in $d$, we
can write
\begin{equation*}
\biggl(z-\frac{d}{2}\biggr)^2\approx z^2-zd.
\end{equation*}
It is convenient to write
\begin{equation*}
x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2.

Then
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation*}

\frac{1}{r}\biggl(1-\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{zd}{r^2}\biggr).

The difference of these two terms gives for the potential
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:9}
\phi(x,y,z)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO}\,\frac{z}{r^3}\,qd.
\end{equation}
The potential, and hence the field, which is its derivative, is
proportional to $qd$, the product of the charge and the separation. This
product is defined as the <em class="emph">dipole moment</em> of the two charges, for which we
will use the symbol $p$ (do <em class="emph">not</em> confuse with momentum!):

<span class="tag">6–3</span>Remarks on vector equations</h3>
<div id="Ch6-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">This is a good place to make a general remark about vector
analysis. The fundamental proofs can be expressed by elegant equations
in a general form, but in making various calculations and analyses it
is always a good idea to choose the axes in some convenient
way. Notice that when we were finding the potential of a dipole we
chose the $z$-axis along the direction of the dipole, rather than at
some arbitrary angle. This made the work much easier. But then we
wrote the equations in vector form so that they would no longer depend
on any particular coordinate system. After that, we are allowed to
choose any coordinate system we wish, knowing that the relation is, in
general, true. It clearly doesn’t make any sense to bother with an
arbitrary coordinate system at some complicated angle when you can
choose a neat system for the particular problem—provided that the
result can finally be expressed as a vector equation. So by all means
take advantage of the fact that vector equations are independent of
any coordinate system.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">On the other hand, if you are trying to calculate the divergence of a
vector, instead of just looking at $\FLPdiv{\FLPE}$ and wondering what
it is, don’t forget that it can always be spread out as
\begin{equation*}
\ddp{E_x}{x}+\ddp{E_y}{y}+\ddp{E_z}{z}.
\end{equation*}

If you can then work out the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-components of the
electric field and differentiate them, you will have the
divergence. There often seems to be a feeling that there is something
inelegant—some kind of defeat involved—in writing out the
components; that somehow there ought always to be a way to do
everything with the vector operators. There is often no advantage to
it. The first time we encounter a particular kind of problem, it
usually helps to write out the components to be sure we understand
what is going on. There is nothing inelegant about putting numbers
into equations, and nothing inelegant about substituting the
derivatives for the fancy symbols. In fact, there is often a certain
cleverness in doing just that. Of course when you publish a paper in a
professional journal it will look better—and be more easily
understood—if you can write everything in vector form. Besides, it
saves print.</p>

(Let’s leave off the $1/4\pi\epsO$ while we make these arguments; we
can stick it in at the end.) Now if we move the charge $+q$ up a
distance $\Delta z$, the potential at $P$ will change a little, by,
say, $\Delta\phi_+$. How much is $\Delta\phi_+$? Well, it is just the
amount that the potential <em class="emph">would</em> change if we were to
<em class="emph">leave</em> the charge at the origin and move $P$ <em class="emph">downward</em> by

<div id="Ch6-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We can think of our object as an assembly of point charges $q_i$ in a
certain limited region, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F7">6–7</a>. (We can,
later, replace $q_i$ by $\rho\,dV$ if we wish.) Let each charge $q_i$
be located at the displacement $\FLPd_i$ from an origin chosen
somewhere in the middle of the group of charges. What is the potential
at the point $P$, located at $\FLPR$, where $\FLPR$ is much larger
than the maximum $\FLPd_i$? The potential from the whole collection is
given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:21}
\phi=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO}\sum_i\frac{q_i}{r_i},
\end{equation}

where $r_i$ is the distance from $P$ to the charge $q_i$ (the length
of the vector $\FLPR-\FLPd_i$). Now if the distance from the charges
to $P$, the point of observation, is enormous, each of the $r_i$’s can
be approximated by $R$. Each term becomes $q_i/R$, and we can
take $1/R$ out as a factor in front of the summation. This gives us the
simple result
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:22}
\phi=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO}\,\frac{1}{R}\sum_iq_i=
\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsO R},
\end{equation}

where $Q$ is just the total charge of the whole object. Thus we find
that for points far enough from any lump of charge, the lump looks
like a point charge. The result is not too surprising.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">But what if there are equal numbers of positive and negative charges?
Then the total charge $Q$ of the object is zero. This is not an
unusual case; in fact, as we know, objects are usually neutral. The
water molecule is neutral, but the charges are not all at one point,
so if we are close enough we should be able to see some effects of the
separate charges. We need a better approximation than (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII622">6.22</a>)
for the potential from an arbitrary distribution of charge in a neutral
object. Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII621">6.21</a>) is still precise, but we can no
longer just set $r_i=R$. We need a more accurate expression for $r_i$.
If the point $P$ is at a large distance, $r_i$ will differ from $R$ to
an excellent approximation by the projection of $\FLPd$ on $\FLPR$, as
can be seen from Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F7">6–7</a>. (You should imagine that $P$
is really farther away than is shown in the figure.) In other words,
if $\FLPe_R$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\FLPR$, then our next
approximation to $r_i$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:23}
r_i\approx R-\FLPd_i\cdot\FLPe_R.
\end{equation}

What we really want is $1/r_i$, which, since $d_i\ll R$, can be
written to our approximation as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:24}
\frac{1}{r_i}\approx\frac{1}{R}\biggl(1+\frac{\FLPd_i\cdot\FLPe_R}{R}\biggr).
\end{equation}

Substituting this in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII621">6.21</a>), we get that the potential is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:25}
\phi=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO}\biggl(\frac{Q}{R}+
\sum_iq_i\frac{\FLPd_i\cdot\FLPe_R}{R^2}+\dotsb\biggr).
\end{equation}

The three dots indicate the terms of higher order in $d_i/R$ that we
have neglected.  These, as well as the ones we have already obtained,
are successive terms in a Taylor expansion of $1/r_i$
about $1/R$ in powers of $d_i/R$.</p>

<p class="p">The first term in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII625">6.25</a>) is what we got before; it drops

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:26}
\FLPp=\sum_iq_i\FLPd_i
\end{equation}

as a property of the charge distribution, the second term of the

<p class="p">Our result is that, far enough away from <em class="emph">any</em> mess of charges

on the surface? They must distribute themselves so that the potential
of the surface is constant. If the surface were not an equipotential,
there would be an electric field inside the conductor, and the charges
would keep moving until it became zero. The general problem of this
kind can be solved in the following way. We guess at a distribution of
charge and calculate the potential. If the potential turns out to be
constant everywhere on the surface, the problem is finished. If the
surface is not an equipotential, we have guessed the wrong

difficult.  Nature, of course, has time to do it; the charges push and

problem, however, it takes us so long to make each trial that that
method is very tedious. With an arbitrary group of conductors and
charges the problem can be very complicated, and in general it cannot
be solved without rather elaborate numerical methods. Such numerical

positive point charge, some induced negative charges on the conducting
sheet that have been attracted by the positive charge (from large
distances away). Now suppose that for some technical reason—or out
of curiosity—you would like to know how the negative charges are
distributed on the surface. You can find the surface charge density by
using the result we worked out in Section <a href="II_05.html#Ch5-S9">5–9</a> with
Gauss’ law. The normal component of the electric field just outside a
conductor is equal to the density of surface charge $\sigma$ divided
by $\epsO$. We can obtain the density of charge at any point on the
surface by working backwards from the normal component of the electric
field at the surface. We know that, because we know the field
everywhere.</p>

<div id="Ch6-S8-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Consider a point on the surface at the distance $\rho$ from the point

E_{n+}=-\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO}\,\frac{aq}{(a^2+\rho^2)^{3/2}}.

To this we must add the electric field produced by the negative image
charge. That just doubles the normal component (and cancels all
others), so the charge density $\sigma$ at any point on the surface is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:29}
\sigma(\rho)=\epsO E(\rho)=-\frac{2aq}{4\pi(a^2+\rho^2)^{3/2}}.

(from Eq. <a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII629">6.29</a>), we could compute the force on our
positive point charge by an integral. But we also know that the force
acting on the positive charge is exactly the same as it <em class="emph">would

fields in the neighborhood are the same in both cases. The point
charge feels a force toward the plate whose magnitude is
\begin{equation}

center. The sphere will be at zero potential.</p>

<div id="Ch6-S9-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The mathematical reason stems from the fact that a sphere is the locus
of all points for which the distances from two points are in a

\begin{equation*}

and we have put no charge on it? Or if we know that the total

positive charge attracts negative charges to the side closer to itself

attraction by the negative charges exceeds the repulsion from the
positive charges; there is a net attraction. We can find out how large
the attraction is by computing the force on $q$ in the field produced

such solutions. The charges are doubled, the fields are doubled, and
the work done in carrying a unit charge from one point to the other is
also doubled. Therefore the potential difference between any two
points is proportional to the charges. In particular, the potential
difference between the two conductors is proportional to the charges
on them. Someone originally wrote the equation of proportionality the
other way. That is, they wrote
\begin{equation*}
Q=CV,
\end{equation*}

where $C$ is a constant. This coefficient of proportionality is called
the <em class="emph">capacity</em>, and such a system of two
conductors is called a <em class="emph">condenser</em>.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> For our parallel-plate

<p class="p">This formula is not exact, because the field is not really uniform
everywhere between the plates, as we assumed. The field does not just
suddenly quit at the edges, but really is more as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F13">6–13</a>. The total charge is not $\sigma A$, as we have
assumed—there is a little correction for the effects at the edges. To
find out what the correction is, we will have to calculate the field
more exactly and find out just what does happen at the edges. That is a
complicated mathematical problem which can, however, be solved by
techniques which we will not describe now. The result of such
calculations is that the charge density rises somewhat near the edges of
the plates. This means that the capacity of the plates is a little
higher than we computed.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S10-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">We have talked about the capacity for two conductors only. Sometimes
people talk about the capacity of a single object. They say, for
instance, that the capacity of a sphere of radius $a$ is $4\pi\epsO
a$. What they imagine is that the other terminal is another sphere of
infinite radius—that when there is a charge $+Q$ on the sphere, the
opposite charge, $-Q$, is on an infinite sphere. One can also speak of
capacities when there are three or more conductors, a discussion we
shall, however, defer.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S10-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose that we wish to have a condenser with a very large
capacity. We could get a large capacity by taking a very big area and
a very small separation. We could put waxed paper between sheets of
aluminum foil and roll it up. (If we seal it in plastic, we have a
typical radio-type condenser.) What good is it?  It is good for
storing charge. If we try to store charge on a ball, for example, its
potential rises rapidly as we charge it up. It may even get so high
that the charge begins to escape into the air by way of sparks. But if
we put the same charge on a condenser whose capacity is very large,
the voltage developed across the condenser will be small.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S10-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">In many applications in electronic circuits, it is useful to have
something which can absorb or deliver large quantities of charge
without changing its potential much. A condenser (or “capacitor”)
does just that. There are also many applications in electronic
instruments and in computers where a condenser is used to get a
specified change in voltage in response to a particular change in
charge. We have seen a similar application in Chapter <a href="I_23.html">23</a>,
Vol. I, where we described the properties of resonant circuits.</p>

<p class="p">From the definition of $C$, we see that its unit is one coulomb/volt.
This unit is also called a <em class="emph">farad</em>. Looking at
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII634">6.34</a>), we see that one can express the units of $\epsO$
as farad/meter, which is the unit most commonly used. Typical sizes of
condensers run from one micro-microfarad ($1$ picofarad) to millifarads.
Small condensers of a few picofarads are used in high-frequency tuned
circuits, and capacities up to hundreds or thousands of microfarads are
found in power-supply filters. A pair of plates one square centimeter in
area with a one millimeter separation have a capacity of roughly one
micro-microfarad.</p>

<div id="Ch6-S11-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We would like now to discuss qualitatively some of the characteristics
of the fields around conductors. If we charge a conductor that is not
a sphere, but one that has on it a point or a very sharp end, as, for
example, the object sketched in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F14">6–14</a>, the field
around the point is much higher than the field in the other
regions. The reason is, qualitatively, that charges try to spread out
as much as possible on the surface of a conductor, and the tip of a
sharp point is as far away as it is possible to be from most of the
surface. Some of the charges on the plate get pushed all the way to
the tip. A relatively <em class="emph">small</em> amount of charge on the tip can
still provide a large surface <em class="emph">density</em>; a high charge density
means a high field just outside.</p>

<span class="tag">Fig. 6–15.</span>The field of a pointed object can be approximated by that of
two spheres at the same potential.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S11-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">One way to see that the field is highest at those places on a
conductor where the radius of curvature is smallest is to consider the
combination of a big sphere and a little sphere connected by a wire,
as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F15">6–15</a>. It is a somewhat idealized
version of the conductor of Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F14">6–14</a>. The wire will
have little influence on the fields outside; it is there to keep the
spheres at the same potential. Now, which ball has the biggest field
at its surface? If the ball on the left has the radius $a$ and carries
a charge $Q$, its potential is about
\begin{equation*}
\phi_1=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO}\,\frac{Q}{a}.
\end{equation*}

(Of course the presence of one ball changes the charge distribution on
the other, so that the charges are not really spherically symmetric on
either. But if we are interested only in an estimate of the fields, we
can use the potential of a spherical charge.) If the smaller ball,
whose radius is $b$, carries the charge $q$, its potential is about
\begin{equation*}
\phi_2=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO}\,\frac{q}{b}.
\end{equation*}

But $\phi_1=\phi_2$, so
\begin{equation*}
\frac{Q}{a}=\frac{q}{b}.
\end{equation*}

On the other hand, the field at the surface (see Eq. <a href="II_05.html#mjx-eqn-EqII58">5.8</a>) is
proportional to the surface charge density, which is like the total
charge over the radius squared. We get that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:6:35}
\frac{E_a}{E_b}=\frac{Q/a^2}{q/b^2}=\frac{b}{a}.
\end{equation}

Therefore the field is higher at the surface of the small sphere. The
fields are in the inverse proportion of the radii.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S11-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">This result is technically very important, because air will break down
if the electric field is too great. What happens is that a loose
charge (electron, or ion) somewhere in the air is accelerated by the
field, and if the field is very great, the charge can pick up enough
speed before it hits another atom to be able to knock an electron off
that atom. As a result, more and more ions are produced. Their motion
constitutes a discharge, or spark. If you want to charge an object to
a high potential and not have it discharge itself by sparks in the
air, you must be sure that the surface is smooth, so that there is no
place where the field is abnormally large.</p>

<div id="Ch6-S12-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">There is an interesting application of the extremely high electric
field which surrounds any sharp protuberance on a charged
conductor. The <em class="emph">field-emission microscope</em> depends for its
operation on the high fields produced at a sharp metal
point.<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a> It is built in the
following way. A very fine needle, with a tip whose diameter is about
$1000$ angstroms, is placed at the center of an evacuated glass
sphere (Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F16">6–16</a>). The inner surface of the sphere is
coated with a thin conducting layer of fluorescent material, and a
very high potential difference is applied between the fluorescent
coating and the needle.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S12-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s first consider what happens when the needle is negative with
respect to the fluorescent coating. The field lines are highly
concentrated at the sharp point.  The electric field can be as high as
$40$ million volts per centimeter. In such intense fields, electrons
are pulled out of the surface of the needle and accelerated across the
potential difference between the needle and the fluorescent
layer. When they arrive there they cause light to be emitted, just as
in a television picture tube.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S12-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The electrons which arrive at a given point on the fluorescent surface
are, to an excellent approximation, those which leave the other end of
the radial field line, because the electrons will travel along the field
line passing from the point to the surface. Thus we see on the surface
some kind of an image of the tip of the needle.  More precisely, we see
a picture of the <em class="emph">emissivity</em> of the surface of
the needle—that is the ease with which electrons can leave the surface
of the metal tip. If the resolution were high enough, one could hope to
resolve the positions of the individual atoms on the tip of the needle.
With electrons, this resolution is not possible for the following
reasons. First, there is quantum-mechanical diffraction of the electron
waves which blurs the image. Second, due to the internal motions of the
electrons in the metal they have a small sideways initial velocity when
they leave the needle, and this random transverse component of the
velocity causes some smearing of the image. The combination of these two
effects limits the resolution to $25$ Å or so.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S12-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">If, however, we reverse the polarity and introduce a small amount of
helium gas into the bulb, much higher resolutions are possible. When a
helium atom collides with the tip of the needle, the intense field
there strips an electron off the helium atom, leaving it positively
charged. The helium ion is then accelerated outward along a field line
to the fluorescent screen. Since the helium ion is so much heavier
than an electron, the quantum-mechanical wavelengths are much smaller.
If the temperature is not too high, the effect of the thermal
velocities is also smaller than in the electron case. With less
smearing of the image a much sharper picture of the point is
obtained. It has been possible to obtain magnifications up to
$2{,}000{,}000$ times with the positive ion field-emission
microscope—a magnification ten times better than is obtained with
the best electron microscope.</p>

<p class="p">Figure <a href="#Ch6-F17">6–17</a> is an example of the results which were
obtained with a field-ion microscope, using a tungsten needle. The
center of a tungsten atom ionizes a helium atom at a slightly
different rate than the spaces between the tungsten atoms. The pattern
of spots on the fluorescent screen shows the arrangement of the
<em class="emph">individual atoms</em> on the tungsten tip. The reason the spots
appear in rings can be understood by visualizing a large box of balls
packed in a rectangular array, representing the atoms in the metal. If
you cut an approximately spherical section out of this box, you will
see the ring pattern characteristic of the atomic structure.  The
field-ion microscope provided human beings with the means of seeing
atoms for the first time. This is a remarkable achievement,
considering the simplicity of the instrument.</p>
