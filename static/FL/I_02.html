<p class="p">In this chapter, we shall examine the most fundamental ideas
that we have about physics—the nature of things as we see them at the
present time. We shall not discuss the history of how we know that all
these ideas are true; you will learn these details in due time.</p>

<p class="p">The things with which we concern ourselves in science appear in myriad
forms, and with a multitude of attributes. For example, if we stand on
the shore and look at the sea, we see the water, the waves breaking, the
foam, the sloshing motion of the water, the sound, the air, the winds
and the clouds, the sun and the blue sky, and light; there is sand and
there are rocks of various hardness and permanence, color and texture.
There are animals and seaweed, hunger and disease, and the observer on
the beach; there may be even happiness and thought. Any other spot in
nature has a similar variety of things and influences. It is always as
complicated as that, no matter where it is. Curiosity demands that we
ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand
this multitude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a
relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an
infinite variety of combinations.</p>

perhaps nothing but a great number of very tiny stones? Is the moon a

sloshing motion of the water in the sea? What common features do
different movements have? What is common to different kinds of sound?
How many different colors are there? And so on. In this way we try

<p class="p">A few hundred years ago, a method was devised to find partial answers to
such questions. <em class="emph">Observation</em>, <em class="emph">reason</em>, and <em class="emph">experiment</em>
make up what we call the <em class="emph">scientific method</em>. We shall have to limit ourselves to a bare description of our
basic view of what is sometimes called <em class="emph">fundamental physics</em>, or
fundamental ideas which have arisen from the application of the
scientific method.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">What do we mean by “understanding” something? We can imagine that this
complicated array of moving things which constitutes “the world” is
something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are
observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are;
all we are allowed to do is to <em class="emph">watch</em> the playing. Of course, if
we watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules.
<em class="emph">The rules of the game</em> are what we mean by <em class="emph">fundamental
physics</em>. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to
understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it
is too complicated and our minds are limited. If you play chess you must
know that it is easy to learn all the rules, and yet it is often very
hard to select the best move or to understand why a player moves as he
does. So it is in nature, only much more so; but we may be able at least
to find all the rules. Actually, we do not have all the rules now.
(Every once in a while something like castling is going on that we still
do not understand.) Aside from not knowing all of the rules, what we
really can explain in terms of those rules is very limited, because
almost all situations are so enormously complicated that we cannot
follow the plays of the game using the rules, much less tell what is
going to happen next. We must, therefore, limit ourselves to the more
basic question of the rules of the game. If we know the rules, we
consider that we “understand” the world.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">How can we tell whether the rules which we “guess” at are really right
if we cannot analyze the game very well? There are, roughly speaking,
three ways. First, there may be situations where nature has arranged, or
we arrange nature, to be simple and to have so few parts that we can
predict exactly what will happen, and thus we can check how our rules
work. (In one corner of the board there may be only a few chess pieces
at work, and that we can figure out exactly.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">A second good way to check rules is in terms of less specific rules
derived from them. For example, the rule on the move of a bishop on a
chessboard is that it moves only on the diagonal. One can deduce, no
matter how many moves may be made, that a certain bishop will always be
on a red square. So, without being able to follow the details, we can
always check our idea about the bishop’s motion by finding out whether
it is always on a red square. Of course it will be, for a long time,
until all of a sudden we find that it is on a <em class="emph">black</em> square (what
happened of course, is that in the meantime it was captured, another
pawn crossed for queening, and it turned into a bishop on a black
square). That is the way it is in physics. For a long time we will have
a rule that works excellently in an over-all way, even when we cannot
follow the details, and then some time we may discover a <em class="emph">new
rule</em>. From the point of view of basic physics, the most interesting
phenomena are of course in the <em class="emph">new</em> places, the places where the
rules do not work—not the places where they <em class="emph">do</em> work!  That is
the way in which we discover new rules.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">The third way to tell whether our ideas are right is relatively crude
but probably the most powerful of them all. That is, by rough
<em class="emph">approximation</em>. While we may not be able to tell why Alekhine
moves <em class="emph">this particular piece</em>, perhaps we can <em class="emph">roughly</em>
understand that he is gathering his pieces around the king to protect
it, more or less, since that is the sensible thing to do in the
circumstances. In the same way, we can often understand nature, more or
less, without being able to see what <em class="emph">every little piece</em> is doing,
in terms of our understanding of the game.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">At first the phenomena of nature were roughly divided into classes, like
heat, electricity, mechanics, magnetism, properties of substances,
chemical phenomena, light or optics, x-rays, nuclear physics,
gravitation, meson phenomena, etc. However, the aim is to see
<em class="emph">complete nature</em> as different aspects of <em class="emph">one set</em> of
phenomena. That is the problem in basic theoretical physics, today—to
<em class="emph">find the laws behind experiment;</em> to <em class="emph">amalgamate these
classes</em>. Historically, we have always been able to amalgamate
them, but as time goes on new things are found. We were
amalgamating very well, when all of a sudden x-rays were found.
Then we amalgamated some more, and mesons were found. Therefore,
at any stage of the game, it always looks rather messy. A great deal is
amalgamated, but there are always many wires or threads hanging
out in all directions. That is the situation today, which we shall try
to describe.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Some historic examples of amalgamation are the following. First,
take <em class="emph">heat</em> and <em class="emph">mechanics</em>. When atoms are in motion, the
more motion, the more heat the system contains, and so <em class="emph">heat and
all temperature effects can be represented by the laws of mechanics</em>.
Another tremendous amalgamation was the discovery of the relation
between electricity, magnetism, and light, which were found to be
different aspects of the same thing, which we call today the
<em class="emph">electromagnetic field</em>. Another amalgamation
is the unification of chemical phenomena, the various properties of
various substances, and the behavior of atomic particles, which is in
the <em class="emph">quantum mechanics of chemistry</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">The question is, of course, is it going to be possible to
amalgamate <em class="emph">everything</em>, and merely discover that this world
represents different aspects of <em class="emph">one</em> thing? Nobody knows. All we
know is that as we go along, we find that we can amalgamate
pieces, and then we find some pieces that do not fit, and we keep trying
to put the jigsaw puzzle together. Whether there are a finite number of
pieces, and whether there is even a border to the puzzle, is of course
unknown. It will never be known until we finish the picture, if ever.
What we wish to do here is to see to what extent this amalgamation
process has gone on, and what the situation is at present, in
understanding basic phenomena in terms of the smallest set of
principles. To express it in a simple manner, <em class="emph">what are things made
of and how few elements are there?</em>

<span class="tag">2–2</span>Physics before 1920</h3>
<div id="Ch2-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">It is a little difficult to begin at once with the present view, so we
shall first see how things looked in about 1920 and then take a few
things out of that picture. Before 1920, our world picture was something
like this: The “stage” on which the universe goes is the
three-dimensional <em class="emph">space</em> of geometry, as described by
Euclid, and things change in a medium
called <em class="emph">time</em>. The elements on the stage are
<em class="emph">particles</em>, for example the atoms, which have some
<em class="emph">properties</em>. First, the property of inertia: if a
particle is moving it keeps on going in the same direction unless
<em class="emph">forces</em> act upon it. The second element, then, is <em class="emph">forces</em>,
which were then thought to be of two varieties: First, an enormously
complicated, detailed kind of interaction force which held the various
atoms in different combinations in a complicated way, which determined
whether salt would dissolve faster or slower when we raise the
temperature. The other force that was known was a long-range
interaction—a smooth and quiet attraction—which varied inversely as
the square of the distance, and was called
<em class="emph">gravitation</em>. This law was known and was
very simple. <em class="emph">Why</em> things remain in motion when they are moving, or
<em class="emph">why</em> there is a law of gravitation was, of course, not known.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">A description of nature is what we are concerned with here. From this
point of view, then, a gas, and indeed <em class="emph">all</em> matter, is a myriad of
moving particles. Thus many of the things we saw while standing at the
seashore can immediately be connected. First the pressure: this comes
from the collisions of the atoms with the walls or whatever; the drift
of the atoms, if they are all moving in one direction on the average, is
wind; the <em class="emph">random</em> internal motions are the <em class="emph">heat</em>. There are
waves of excess density, where too many particles have collected, and so
as they rush off they push up piles of particles farther out, and so on.
This wave of excess density is <em class="emph">sound</em>. It is a
tremendous achievement to be able to understand so much. Some of these
things were described in the previous chapter.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">What <em class="emph">kinds</em> of particles are there? There were considered to be
$92$ at that time: $92$ different kinds of atoms were ultimately
discovered. They had different names associated with their chemical
properties.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">The next part of the problem was, <em class="emph">what are the short-range
forces?</em> Why does carbon attract one oxygen or perhaps two oxygens, but
not three oxygens? What is the machinery of interaction between atoms?
Is it gravitation? The answer is no. Gravity is entirely too weak. But
imagine a force analogous to gravity, varying inversely with the square
of the distance, but enormously more powerful and having one difference.
In gravity everything attracts everything else, but now imagine that
there are <em class="emph">two kinds</em> of “things,” and that this new force (which
is the electrical force, of course) has the property that likes
<em class="emph">repel</em> but unlikes <em class="emph">attract</em>. The “thing” that carries this
strong interaction is called <em class="emph">charge</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Then what do we have? Suppose that we have two unlikes that attract each
other, a plus and a minus, and that they stick very close together.
Suppose we have another charge some distance away. Would it feel any
attraction? It would feel <em class="emph">practically none</em>, because if the first
two are equal in size, the attraction for the one and the repulsion for
the other balance out. Therefore there is very little force at any
appreciable distance. On the other hand, if we get <em class="emph">very close</em>
with the extra charge, <em class="emph">attraction</em> arises, because the repulsion
of likes and attraction of unlikes will tend to bring unlikes closer
together and push likes farther apart. Then the repulsion will be
<em class="emph">less</em> than the attraction. This is the reason why the atoms, which
are constituted out of plus and minus electric charges, feel very little
force when they are separated by appreciable distance (aside from
gravity). When they come close together, they can “see inside” each
other and rearrange their charges, with the result that they have a very
strong interaction. The ultimate basis of an interaction between the
atoms is <em class="emph">electrical</em>. Since this force is so enormous, all the
plusses and all minuses will normally come together in as intimate a
combination as they can. All things, even ourselves, are made of
fine-grained, enormously strongly interacting plus and minus parts, all
neatly balanced out. Once in a while, by accident, we may rub off a few
minuses or a few plusses (usually it is easier to rub off minuses), and
in those circumstances we find the force of electricity
<em class="emph">unbalanced</em>, and we can then see the effects of these electrical
attractions.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">To give an idea of how much stronger electricity is than gravitation,
consider two grains of sand, a millimeter across, thirty meters apart.
If the force between them were not balanced, if everything attracted
everything else instead of likes repelling, so that there were no
cancellation, how much force would there be? There would be a force of
<em class="emph">three million tons</em> between the two! You see, there is very,
<em class="emph">very</em> little excess or deficit of the number of negative or
positive charges necessary to produce appreciable electrical effects.
This is, of course, the reason why you cannot see the difference between
an electrically charged or uncharged thing—so few particles are
involved that they hardly make a difference in the weight or size of an
object.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">With this picture the atoms were easier to understand. They were thought
to have a “nucleus” at the center, which is positively
electrically charged and very massive, and the nucleus is
surrounded by a certain number of “electrons” which are very light and
negatively charged. Now we go a little ahead in our story to remark that
in the nucleus itself there were found two kinds of
particles, protons and neutrons, almost
of the same weight and very heavy. The protons are electrically charged
and the neutrons are neutral. If we have an atom with
six protons inside its nucleus, and this is surrounded by
six electrons (the negative particles in the ordinary world of matter
are all electrons, and these are very light compared with the protons
and neutrons which make nuclei), this would be atom
number six in the chemical table, and it is called carbon. Atom number
eight is called oxygen, etc., because the chemical properties depend
upon the electrons on the <em class="emph">outside</em>, and in fact only upon
<em class="emph">how many</em> electrons there are. So the <em class="emph">chemical</em> properties
of a substance depend only on a number, the number of electrons. (The
whole list of elements of the chemists really could have been called
$1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, etc. Instead of saying “carbon,” we could say
“element six,” meaning six electrons, but of course, when the elements
were first discovered, it was not known that they could be numbered that
way, and secondly, it would make everything look rather complicated. It
is better to have names and symbols for these things, rather than to
call everything by number.)
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">More was discovered about the electrical force. The natural
interpretation of electrical interaction is that two objects simply
attract each other: plus against minus. However, this was discovered to
be an inadequate idea to represent it. A more adequate representation of
the situation is to say that the existence of the positive charge, in
some sense, distorts, or creates a “condition” in space, so that when
we put the negative charge in, it feels a force. This potentiality for
producing a force is called an <em class="emph">electric field</em>. When we put an
electron in an electric field, we say it is “pulled.”
We then have two rules: (a) charges make a field, and (b) charges in
fields have forces on them and move. The reason for this will become
clear when we discuss the following phenomena: If we were to charge a
body, say a comb, electrically, and then place a charged piece of paper
at a distance and move the comb back and forth, the paper will respond
by always pointing to the comb. If we shake it faster, it will be
discovered that the paper is a little behind, <em class="emph">there is a delay</em> in
the action. (At the first stage, when we move the comb rather slowly, we
find a complication which is <em class="emph">magnetism</em>. Magnetic
influences have to do with <em class="emph">charges in relative motion</em>, so
magnetic forces and electric forces can really be attributed to one
field, as two different aspects of exactly the same thing. A changing
electric field cannot exist without magnetism.)  If we move the charged
paper farther out, the delay is greater. Then an interesting thing is
observed. Although the forces between two charged objects should go
inversely as the <em class="emph">square</em> of the distance, it is found, when we
shake a charge, that the influence extends <em class="emph">very much farther out</em>
than we would guess at first sight. That is, the effect falls off more
slowly than the inverse square.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S2-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Here is an analogy: If we are in a pool of water and there is a floating
cork very close by, we can move it “directly” by pushing the water
with another cork. If you looked only at the two <em class="emph">corks</em>, all you
would see would be that one moved immediately in response to the motion
of the other—there is some kind of “<em class="emph">interaction</em>” between
them. Of course, what we really do is to disturb the <em class="emph">water</em>; the
<em class="emph">water</em> then disturbs the other cork. We could make up a “law”
that if you pushed the water a little bit, an object close by in the
water would move. If it were farther away, of course, the second cork
would scarcely move, for we move the water <em class="emph">locally</em>. On the other
hand, if we jiggle the cork a new phenomenon is involved, in which the
motion of the water moves the water there, etc., and <em class="emph">waves</em> travel
away, so that by jiggling, there is an influence <em class="emph">very much farther
out</em>, an oscillatory influence, that cannot be understood from the
direct interaction. Therefore the idea of direct interaction must be
replaced with the existence of the water, or in the electrical case,
with what we call the <em class="emph">electromagnetic field</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S2-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">The electromagnetic field can carry waves; some of these waves are
<em class="emph">light</em>, others are used in
<em class="emph">radio broadcasts</em>, but the general name is <em class="emph">electromagnetic
waves</em>.
These oscillatory waves can have various <em class="emph">frequencies</em>. The only
thing that is really different from one wave to another is the
<em class="emph">frequency of oscillation</em>. If we shake a
charge back and forth more and more rapidly, and look at the effects, we
get a whole series of different kinds of effects, which are all unified
by specifying but one number, the number of oscillations per second. The
usual “pickup” that we get from electric currents in the circuits in
the walls of a building have a frequency of about one hundred cycles per
second. If we increase the frequency to $500$ or $1000$ kilocycles
($1$ kilocycle${}=1000$ cycles) per second, we are “on the air,” for
this is the frequency range which is used for radio broadcasts. (Of
course it has nothing to do with the <em class="emph">air!</em> We can have radio
broadcasts without any air.) If we again increase the frequency, we come
into the range that is used for FM and TV. Going still further, we use
certain short waves, for example for <em class="emph">radar</em>. Still higher, and we
do not need an instrument to “see” the stuff, we can see it with the
human eye. In the range of frequency from $5\times10^{14}$ to
$10^{15}$ cycles per second our eyes would see the oscillation of the
charged comb, if we could shake it that fast, as red, blue, or violet
light, depending on the frequency. Frequencies below this range are
called infrared, and above it, ultraviolet. The fact that we can see
in a particular frequency range makes that part of the electromagnetic
spectrum no more impressive than the other parts from a physicist’s
standpoint, but from a human standpoint, of course, it <em class="emph">is</em> more
interesting. If we go up even higher in frequency, we get
x-rays.
X-rays are nothing but very
high-frequency light. If we go still higher, we get gamma
rays. These two terms,
x-rays and gamma rays, are used almost synonymously. Usually
electromagnetic rays coming from nuclei are called gamma
rays, while those of high
energy from atoms are called
x-rays, but at the same frequency
they are indistinguishable physically, no matter what their source. If
we go to still higher frequencies, say to $10^{24}$ cycles per second,
we find that we can make those waves artificially, for example with the
synchrotron here at Caltech. We can find
electromagnetic waves with stupendously high frequencies—with even a
thousand times more rapid oscillation—in the waves found in
<em class="emph">cosmic rays</em>.
These waves cannot be controlled by us.</p>

<div id="Ch2-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Having described the idea of the electromagnetic field, and that this
field can carry waves, we soon learn that these waves actually behave in
a strange way which seems very unwavelike. At higher frequencies they
behave much more like <em class="emph">particles!</em> It is <em class="emph">quantum mechanics</em>,
discovered just after 1920, which explains this strange behavior. In the
years before 1920, the picture of space as a three-dimensional space,
and of time as a separate thing, was changed by
Einstein, first into a
combination which we call space-time, and then still
further into a <em class="emph">curved</em> space-time to represent
gravitation. So the “stage” is changed into
space-time, and gravitation is presumably a
modification of space-time. Then it was also found
that the rules for the motions of particles were incorrect. The
mechanical rules of “inertia” and “forces” are
<em class="emph">wrong</em>—Newton’s laws are
<em class="emph">wrong</em>—in the world of atoms. Instead, it was discovered that
things on a small scale behave <em class="emph">nothing like</em> things on a large
scale. That is what makes physics difficult—and very interesting. It
is hard because the way things behave on a small scale is so
“unnatural”; we have no direct experience with it. Here things behave
like nothing we know of, so that it is impossible to describe this
behavior in any other than analytic ways. It is difficult, and takes a
lot of imagination.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Quantum mechanics has many aspects. In the first place, the idea that a
particle has a definite location and a definite speed is no longer
allowed; that is wrong. To give an example of how wrong classical
physics is, there is a rule in quantum mechanics that says that one
cannot know both where something is and how fast it is moving. The
uncertainty of the momentum and the uncertainty of the position are
complementary, and the product of the two is bounded by a small
constant. We can write the law like this: $\Delta x\,\Delta
p\geq\hbar/2$, but
we shall explain it in more detail later. This rule is the explanation
of a very mysterious paradox: if the atoms are made out of plus and
minus charges, why don’t the minus charges simply sit on top of the plus
charges (they attract each other) and get so close as to completely
cancel them out? <em class="emph">Why are atoms so big?</em> Why is the
nucleus at the center with the electrons around it? It
was first thought that this was because the nucleus was
so big; but no, the nucleus is <em class="emph">very small</em>. An atom
has a diameter of about $10^{-8}$ cm. The nucleus has a
diameter of about $10^{-13}$ cm. If we had an atom and wished to see the
nucleus, we would have to magnify it until the whole atom
was the size of a large room, and then the nucleus would
be a bare speck which you could just about make out with the eye, but
very nearly <em class="emph">all the weight</em> of the atom is in that infinitesimal
<em class="emph">nucleus</em>. What keeps the electrons from simply
falling in? This principle: If they were in the nucleus,
we would know their position precisely, and the uncertainty
principle would then require that they have a very <em class="emph">large</em> (but
uncertain) momentum, i.e., a very large <em class="emph">kinetic
energy</em>. With this
energy they would break away from the nucleus. They make
a compromise: they leave themselves a little room for this uncertainty
and then jiggle with a certain amount of minimum motion in accordance
with this rule. (Remember that when a crystal is cooled to absolute
zero, we said that the atoms
do not stop moving, they still jiggle. Why? If they stopped moving, we
would know where they were and that they had zero motion, and that is
against the uncertainty principle. We cannot know where
they are and how fast they are moving, so they must be continually
wiggling in there!)

<div id="Ch2-S3-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Another most interesting change in the ideas and philosophy of science
brought about by quantum mechanics is this: it is not possible to
predict <em class="emph">exactly</em> what will happen in any circumstance. For
example, it is possible to arrange an atom which is ready to emit light,
and we can measure when it has emitted light by picking up a photon
particle, which we shall describe shortly. We cannot, however, predict
<em class="emph">when</em> it is going to emit the light or, with several atoms,
<em class="emph">which one</em> is going to. You may say that this is because there are
some internal “wheels” which we have not looked at closely enough. No,
there <em class="emph">are</em> no internal wheels; nature, as we understand it today,
behaves in such a way that it is <em class="emph">fundamentally impossible</em> to make
a precise prediction of <em class="emph">exactly what will happen</em> in a given
experiment. This is a horrible thing; in fact, philosophers have said
before that one of the fundamental requisites of science is that
whenever you set up the same conditions, the same thing must happen.
This is simply <em class="emph">not true</em>, it is <em class="emph">not</em> a fundamental condition
of science. The fact is that the same thing does not happen, that we can
find only an average, statistically, as to what happens. Nevertheless,
science has not completely collapsed. Philosophers, incidentally, say a
great deal about what is <em class="emph">absolutely necessary</em> for science, and it
is always, so far as one can see, rather naive, and probably wrong. For
example, some philosopher or other said it is fundamental to the
scientific effort that if an experiment is performed in, say, Stockholm,
and then the same experiment is done in, say, Quito, the <em class="emph">same
results</em> must occur. That is quite false. It is not necessary that
<em class="emph">science</em> do that; it may be a <em class="emph">fact of experience</em>, but it is
not necessary. For example, if one of the experiments is to look out at
the sky and see the aurora borealis in Stockholm, you do not see it in
Quito; that is a different phenomenon. “But,” you say, “that is
something that has to do with the outside; can you close yourself up in
a box in Stockholm and pull down the shade and get any difference?”
Surely. If we take a pendulum on a universal joint, and pull it out and
let go, then the pendulum will swing almost in a plane, but not quite.
Slowly the plane keeps changing in Stockholm, but not in Quito. The
blinds are down, too. The fact that this happened does not bring on the
destruction of science. What <em class="emph">is</em> the fundamental hypothesis of
science, the fundamental philosophy? We stated it in the first chapter:
<em class="emph">the sole test of the validity of any idea is experiment</em>. If it
turns out that most experiments work out the same in Quito as they do in
Stockholm, then those “most experiments” will be used to formulate
some general law, and those experiments which do not come out the same
we will say were a result of the environment near Stockholm. We will
invent some way to summarize the results of the experiment, and we do
not have to be told ahead of time what this way will look like. If we
are told that the same experiment will always produce the same result,
that is all very well, but if when we try it, it does <em class="emph">not</em>, then
it does <em class="emph">not</em>. We just have to take what we see, and then formulate
all the rest of our ideas in terms of our actual experience.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S3-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Returning again to quantum mechanics and fundamental physics, we cannot
go into details of the quantum-mechanical principles at this time, of
course, because these are rather difficult to understand. We shall
assume that they are there, and go on to describe what some of the
consequences are. One of the consequences is that things which we used
to consider as waves also behave like particles, and particles behave
like waves; in fact everything behaves the same way. There is no
distinction between a wave and a particle. So quantum mechanics
<em class="emph">unifies</em> the idea of the field and its waves, and the particles,
all into one. Now it is true that when the frequency is low, the field
aspect of the phenomenon is more evident, or more useful as an
approximate description in terms of everyday experiences. But as the
frequency increases, the particle aspects of the phenomenon become more
evident with the equipment with which we usually make the measurements.
In fact, although we mentioned many frequencies, no phenomenon directly
involving a frequency has yet been detected above approximately
$10^{12}$ cycles per second. We only <em class="emph">deduce</em> the higher
frequencies from the energy of the particles, by a rule which assumes
that the particle-wave idea of quantum mechanics is valid.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Thus we have a new view of electromagnetic interaction. We have a new
kind of <em class="emph">particle</em> to add to the electron, the proton, and the
neutron. That new particle is called a <em class="emph">photon</em>. The
new view of the interaction of electrons and photons that is
electromagnetic theory, but with everything quantum-mechanically
correct, is called <em class="emph">quantum electrodynamics</em>. This fundamental theory of the interaction of light
and matter, or electric field and charges, is our greatest success so
far in physics. In this one theory we have the basic rules for all
ordinary phenomena except for gravitation and nuclear processes. For
example, out of quantum electrodynamics
come all known electrical, mechanical, and chemical laws: the laws for
the collision of billiard balls, the motions of wires in magnetic
fields, the specific heat of carbon monoxide, the color of neon signs,
the density of salt, and the reactions of hydrogen and oxygen to make
water are all consequences of this one law. All these details can be
worked out if the situation is simple enough for us to make an
approximation, which is almost never, but often we can understand more
or less what is happening. At the present time no exceptions are found
to the quantum-electrodynamic laws
outside the nucleus, and there we do not know whether
there is an exception because we simply do not know what is going on in
the nucleus.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">In principle, then, quantum electrodynamics is the theory of all chemistry, and of life, if life is
ultimately reduced to chemistry and therefore just to physics because
chemistry is already reduced (the part of physics which is involved in
chemistry being already known). Furthermore, the same quantum
electrodynamics, this great thing,
predicts a lot of new things. In the first place, it tells the
properties of very high-energy photons, gamma rays, etc. It predicted
another very remarkable thing: besides the electron, there should be
another particle of the same mass, but of opposite charge, called a
<em class="emph">positron</em>, and these two, coming together, could annihilate each
other with the emission of light or gamma rays. (After all, light and
gamma rays are all the same, they are just different points on a
frequency scale.) The generalization of this, that for each particle
there is an antiparticle, turns out to be true. In
the case of electrons, the antiparticle has another name—it is called
a positron, but for most other particles, it is called anti-so-and-so,
like antiproton or antineutron. In quantum electrodynamics, <em class="emph">two numbers</em> are put in and most of the other
numbers in the world are supposed to come out. The two numbers that are
put in are called the mass of the electron and the charge of the
electron. Actually, that is not quite true, for we have a whole set of
numbers for chemistry which tells how heavy the nuclei are. That leads
us to the next part.</p>

<span class="tag">2–4</span>Nuclei and particles</h3>
<div id="Ch2-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">What are the nuclei made of, and how are they held together? It is found
that the nuclei are held together by enormous forces. When these are
released, the energy released is tremendous compared with chemical
energy, in the same ratio as the atomic bomb explosion is to a TNT
explosion, because, of course, the atomic bomb has to do with changes
inside the nucleus, while the explosion of TNT has to do with the
changes of the electrons on the outside of the atoms. The question is,
what are the forces which hold the protons and neutrons together in the
nucleus? Just as the electrical interaction can be connected to a
particle, a photon, Yukawa
suggested that the forces between neutrons and protons also have a field
of some kind, and that when this field jiggles it behaves like a
particle. Thus there could be some other particles in the world besides
protons and neutrons, and he was able to deduce the properties of these
particles from the already known characteristics of nuclear forces. For
example, he predicted they should have a mass of two or three hundred
times that of an electron; and lo and behold, in cosmic rays there was
discovered a particle of the right mass! But it later turned out to be
the wrong particle. It was called a $\mu$-meson, or muon.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">However, a little while later, in 1947 or 1948, another particle was
found, the $\pi$-meson, or pion, which satisfied
Yukawa’s criterion. Besides the
proton and the neutron, then, in order to get nuclear forces we must add
the pion. Now, you say, “Oh great!, with this theory we make quantum
nucleodynamics using the pions just like Yukawa wanted to do, and see if it works, and everything will be
explained.” Bad luck. It turns out that the calculations that are
involved in this theory are so difficult that no one has ever been able
to figure out what the consequences of the theory are, or to check it
against experiment, and this has been going on now for almost twenty
years!</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">So we are stuck with a theory, and we do not know whether it is right or
wrong, but we do know that it is a <em class="emph">little</em> wrong, or at least
incomplete. While we have been dawdling around theoretically, trying to
calculate the consequences of this theory, the experimentalists have
been discovering some things. For example, they had already discovered
this $\mu$-meson or muon, and we do not yet know where it fits. Also, in
cosmic rays, a large number of other “extra” particles were found. It
turns out that today we have approximately thirty particles, and it is
very difficult to understand the relationships of all these particles,
and what nature wants them for, or what the connections are from one to
another. We do not today understand these various particles as different
aspects of the same thing, and the fact that we have so many unconnected
particles is a representation of the fact that we have so much
unconnected information without a good theory. After the great successes
of quantum electrodynamics, there is a
certain amount of knowledge of nuclear physics which is rough knowledge,
sort of half experience and half theory, assuming a type of force
between protons and neutrons and seeing what will happen, but not really
understanding where the force comes from. Aside from that, we have made
very little progress. We have collected an enormous number of chemical
elements. In the chemical case, there suddenly appeared a relationship
among these elements which was unexpected, and which is embodied in the
periodic table of Mendeleev. For example, sodium and potassium
are about the same in their chemical properties and are found in the
same column in the Mendeleev chart. We have been seeking a
Mendeleev-type chart for the new particles. One such chart of the new
particles was made independently by Gell-Mann in the U.S.A. and Nishijima in Japan. The basis of their classification is a
new number, like the electric charge, which can be assigned to each
particle, called its “strangeness,” $S$.
This number is conserved, like the electric charge, in reactions which
take place by nuclear forces.

<p class="p">In Table <a href="#Ch2-T2">2–2</a> are listed all the particles. We cannot discuss
them much at this stage, but the table will at least show you how much
we do not know. Underneath each particle its mass is given in a certain
unit, called the MeV. One MeV is equal to
$1.783\times10^{-27}$ gram. The reason this unit was chosen is
historical, and we shall not go into it now. More massive particles are
put higher up on the chart; we see that a neutron and a proton have
almost the same mass. In vertical columns we have put the particles with
the same electrical charge, all neutral objects in one column, all
positively charged ones to the right of this one, and all negatively
charged objects to the left.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Particles are shown with a solid line and “resonances” with a dashed
one. Several particles have been omitted from the table. These include
the important zero-mass, zero-charge particles, the photon and the
graviton, which do not fall into the baryon-meson-lepton classification
scheme, and also some of the newer resonances ($\Kstar$, $\phi$,
$\eta$). The antiparticles of the mesons are listed in the table, but
the antiparticles of the leptons and baryons would have to be listed in
another table which would look exactly like this one reflected on the
zero-charge column. Although all of the particles except the electron,
neutrino, photon, graviton, and proton are unstable, decay products have
been shown only for the resonances. Strangeness assignments are not
applicable for leptons, since they do not interact strongly with nuclei.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S4-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">All particles which are together with the neutrons and protons are
called <em class="emph">baryons</em>, and the following ones exist: There is a
“lambda,” with a mass of $1115$ MeV, and three others, called sigmas,
minus, neutral, and plus, with several masses almost the same. There are
groups or multiplets with almost the same mass, within one or two
percent. Each particle in a multiplet has the same strangeness. The
first multiplet is the proton-neutron doublet, and then there is a
singlet (the lambda) then the sigma triplet, and finally the xi doublet.
Very recently, in 1961, even a few more particles were found. Or
<em class="emph">are</em> they particles? They live so short a time, they disintegrate
almost instantaneously, as soon as they are formed, that we do not know
whether they should be considered as new particles, or some kind of
“resonance” interaction of a certain definite energy between the
$\Lambda$ and $\pi$ products into which they disintegrate.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S4-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">In addition to the baryons the other particles which are involved in the
nuclear interaction are called <em class="emph">mesons</em>. There are first the pions,
which come in three varieties, positive, negative, and neutral; they
form another multiplet. We have also found some new things called
K-mesons, and they occur as a doublet, $\Kplus$ and $\Kzero$. Also, every
particle has its antiparticle, unless a particle <em class="emph">is its own</em>
antiparticle. For example, the $\pi^-$ and the $\pi^+$ are
antiparticles, but the $\pi^0$ is its own antiparticle. The $\Kminus$
and $\Kplus$ are antiparticles, and the $\Kzero$ and $\Kzerobar$. In
addition, in 1961 we also found some more mesons or <em class="emph">maybe</em> mesons
which disintegrate almost immediately.  A thing called $\omega$ which
goes into three pions has a mass $780$ on this scale, and somewhat less
certain is an object which disintegrates into two pions. These
particles, called mesons and baryons, and the antiparticles of the
mesons are on the same chart, but the antiparticles of the baryons must
be put on another chart, “reflected” through the charge-zero column.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S4-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Just as Mendeleev’s chart was very good, except for the fact that there
were a number of rare earth elements which were hanging out loose from
it, so we have a number of things hanging out loose from this
chart—particles which do not interact strongly in nuclei, have nothing
to do with a nuclear interaction, and do not have a strong interaction
(I mean the powerful kind of interaction of nuclear energy). These are
called leptons, and they are the following: there is the electron, which
has a very small mass on this scale, only $0.510$ MeV. Then there is
that other, the $\mu$-meson, the muon, which has a mass much higher,
$206$ times as heavy as an electron. So far as we can tell, by all
experiments so far, the difference between the electron and the muon is
nothing but the mass. Everything works exactly the same for the muon as
for the electron, except that one is heavier than the other. Why is
there another one heavier; what is the use for it? We do not know. In
addition, there is a lepton which is neutral, called a neutrino, and
this particle has zero mass. In fact, it is now known that there are
<em class="emph">two</em> different kinds of neutrinos, one related to electrons and
the other related to muons.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S4-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Finally, we have two other particles which do not interact strongly with
the nuclear ones: one is a photon, and perhaps, if the field of gravity
also has a quantum-mechanical analog (a quantum theory of gravitation
has not yet been worked out), then there will be a particle, a graviton,
which will have zero mass.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S4-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">What is this “zero mass”? The masses given here are
the masses of the particles <em class="emph">at rest</em>. The fact that a particle has
zero mass means, in a way, that it cannot <em class="emph">be</em> at
<em class="emph">rest</em>. A photon is never at rest, it is always moving at
$186{,}000$ miles a second. We will understand more what mass means when
we understand the theory of relativity, which will come in due time.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch2-S4-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">Thus we are confronted with a large number of particles, which together
seem to be the fundamental constituents of matter. Fortunately, these
particles are not <em class="emph">all</em> different in their <em class="emph">interactions</em> with
one another. In fact, there seem to be just <em class="emph">four kinds</em> of
interaction between particles which, in the order of decreasing
strength, are the nuclear force, electrical interactions, the beta-decay
interaction, and gravity. The photon is coupled to all charged particles
and the strength of the interaction is measured by some number, which
is $1/137$. The detailed law of this coupling is known, that is quantum
electrodynamics. Gravity is coupled to
all <em class="emph">energy</em>, but its coupling is extremely weak, much weaker than
that of electricity. This law is also known. Then there are the
so-called weak decays—beta decay, which causes the neutron to
disintegrate into proton, electron, and neutrino, relatively slowly.
This law is only partly known. The so-called strong interaction, the
meson-baryon interaction, has a strength of $1$ in this scale, and the
law is completely unknown, although there are a number of known rules,
such as that the number of baryons does not change in any reaction.</p>

<div id="Ch2-S4-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">This then, is the horrible condition of our physics today. To summarize
it, I would say this: outside the nucleus, we seem to know all; inside
it, quantum mechanics is valid—the principles of quantum mechanics
have not been found to fail. The stage on which we put all of our
knowledge, we would say, is relativistic space-time; perhaps gravity is
involved in space-time. We do not know how the universe got started, and
we have never made experiments which check our ideas of space and time
accurately, below some tiny distance, so we only <em class="emph">know</em> that our
ideas work above that distance. We should also add that the rules of the
game are the quantum-mechanical principles, and those principles apply,
so far as we can tell, to the new particles as well as to the old. The
origin of the forces in nuclei leads us to new particles, but
unfortunately they appear in great profusion and we lack a complete
understanding of their interrelationship, although we already know that
there are some very surprising relationships among them. We seem
gradually to be groping toward an understanding of the world of
subatomic particles, but we really do not know how far we have yet to go
in this task.</p>
