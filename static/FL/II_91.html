		These are the lectures in physics that I gave last year and the year before to
        the freshman and sophomore classes at Caltech. The lectures are, of course, not
        verbatim—they have been edited, sometimes extensively and sometimes less so.
        The lectures form only part of the complete course. The whole group of 180
        students gathered in a big lecture room twice a week to hear these lectures and
        then they broke up into small groups of 15 to 20 students in recitation sections
        under the guidance of a teaching assistant. In addition, there was a laboratory
        session once a week.

		</div>
		<div id="Ch91-S1-p2" class="para">
		<p class="p">
		The special problem we tried to get at with these lectures was to maintain the
        interest of the very enthusiastic and rather smart students coming out of the
        high schools and into Caltech. They have heard a lot about how interesting and
        exciting physics is—the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and other
        modern ideas. By the end of two years of our previous course, many would be very
        discouraged because there were really very few grand, new, modern ideas presented
        to them. They were made to study inclined planes, electrostatics, and so forth,
        and after two years it was quite stultifying. The problem was whether or not we
        could make a course which would save the more advanced and excited student by
        maintaining his enthusiasm.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Ch91-S1-p3" class="para">
		<p class="p">
		The lectures here are not in any way meant to be a survey course, but are very
        serious. I thought to address them to the most intelligent in the class and to
        make sure, if possible, that even the most intelligent student was unable to
        completely encompass everything that was in the lectures—by putting in
        suggestions of applications of the ideas and concepts in various directions
        outside the main line of attack. For this reason, though, I tried very hard to
        make all the statements as accurate as possible, to point out in every case where
        the equations and ideas fitted into the body of physics, and how—when they
        learned more—things would be modified. I also felt that for such students it is
        important to indicate what it is that they should—if they are sufficiently
        clever—be able to understand by deduction from what has been said before, and
        what is being put in as something new. When new ideas came in, I would try either
        to deduce them if they were deducible, or to explain that it&nbsp;<i>was</i> a
        new idea which hadn’t any basis in terms of things they had already learned and
        which was not supposed to be provable—but was just added in.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Ch91-S1-p4" class="para">
		<p class="p">
		At the start of these lectures, I assumed that the students knew something
        when they came out of high school—such things as geometrical optics, simple
        chemistry ideas, and so on. I also didn’t see that there was any reason to make
        the lectures in a definite order, in the sense that I would not be allowed to
        mention something until I was ready to discuss it in detail. There was a great
        deal of mention of things to come, without complete discussions. These more
        complete discussions would come later when the preparation became more advanced.
        Examples are the discussions of inductance, and of energy levels, which are at
        first brought in in a very qualitative way and are later developed more
        completely.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Ch91-S1-p5" class="para">
		<p class="p">
		At the same time that I was aiming at the more active student, I also wanted
        to take care of the fellow for whom the extra fireworks and side applications are
        merely disquieting and who cannot be expected to learn most of the material in
        the lecture at all. For such students I wanted there to be at least a central
        core or backbone of material which he <i>could</i> get. Even if he didn’t
        understand everything in a lecture, I hoped he wouldn’t get nervous. I didn’t
        expect him to understand everything, but only the central and most direct
        features. It takes, of course, a certain intelligence on his part to see which
        are the central theorems and central ideas, and which are the more advanced side
        issues and applications which he may understand only in later years.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Ch91-S1-p6" class="para">
		<p class="p">
		In giving these lectures there was one serious difficulty: in the way the
        course was given, there wasn’t any feedback from the students to the lecturer to
        indicate how well the lectures were going over. This is indeed a very serious
        difficulty, and I don’t know how good the lectures really are. The whole thing
        was essentially an experiment. And if I did it again I wouldn’t do it the same
        way—I hope I <i>don’t</i> have to do it again! I think, though, that things
        worked out—so far as the physics is concerned—quite satisfactorily in the
        first year.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Ch91-S1-p7" class="para">
		<p class="p">
		In the second year I was not so satisfied. In the first part of the course,
        dealing with electricity and magnetism, I couldn’t think of any really unique or
        different way of doing it—of any way that would be particularly more exciting
        than the usual way of presenting it. So I don’t think I did very much in the
        lectures on electricity and magnetism. At the end of the second year I had
        originally intended to go on, after the electricity and magnetism, by giving some
        more lectures on the properties of materials, but mainly to take up things like
        fundamental modes, solutions of the diffusion equation, vibrating systems,
        orthogonal functions,&nbsp;… developing the first
        stages of what are usually called “the mathematical methods of physics.”
        In retrospect, I think that if I were doing it again I would go back to that
        original idea. But since it was not planned that I would be giving these lectures
        again, it was suggested that it might be a good idea to try to give an
        introduction to the quantum mechanics—what you will find in Volume III.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Ch91-S1-p8" class="para">
		<p class="p">
		It is perfectly clear that students who will major in physics can wait until
        their third year for quantum mechanics. On the other hand, the argument was made
        that many of the students in our course study physics as a background for their
        primary interest in other fields. And the usual way of dealing with quantum
        mechanics makes that subject almost unavailable for the great majority of
        students because they have to take so long to learn it. Yet, in its real
        applications—especially in its more complex applications, such as in electrical
        engineering and chemistry—the full machinery of the differential equation
        approach is not actually used. So I tried to describe the principles of quantum
        mechanics in a way which wouldn’t require that one first know the mathematics of
        partial differential equations. Even for a physicist I think that is an
        interesting thing to try to do—to present quantum mechanics in this reverse
        fashion—for several reasons which may be apparent in the lectures themselves.
        However, I think that the experiment in the quantum mechanics part was not
        completely successful—in large part because I really did not have enough time
        at the end (I should, for instance, have had three or four more lectures in order
        to deal more completely with such matters as energy bands and the spatial
        dependence of amplitudes). Also, I had never presented the subject this way
        before, so the lack of feedback was particularly serious. I now believe the
        quantum mechanics should be given at a later time. Maybe I’ll have a chance to do
        it again someday. Then I’ll do it right.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Ch91-S1-p9" class="para">
		<p class="p">
		The reason there are no lectures on how to solve problems is because there
        were recitation sections. Although I did put in three lectures in the first year
        on how to solve problems, they are not included here. Also there was a lecture on
        inertial guidance which certainly belongs after the lecture on rotating systems,
        but which was, unfortunately, omitted. The fifth and sixth lectures are actually
        due to Matthew Sands, as I was out of town. The question, of course, is how well
        this experiment has succeeded. My own point of view—which, however, does not
        seem to be shared by most of the people who worked with the students—is
        pessimistic. I don’t think I did very well by the students. When I look at the
        way the majority of the students handled the problems on the examinations, I
        think that the system is a failure. Of course, my friends point out to me that
        there were one or two dozen students who—very surprisingly—understood almost
        everything in all of the lectures, and who were quite active in working with the
        material and worrying about the many points in an excited and interested way.
        These people have now, I believe, a first-rate background in physics—and they
        are, after all, the ones I was trying to get at. But then,&nbsp;"The power of
        instruction is seldom of much efficacy except in those happy dispositions where
        it is almost superfluous.”&nbsp;(Gibbon)
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Ch91-S1-p10" class="para">
		<p class="p">
		Still, I didn’t want to leave any student completely behind, as perhaps I did.
        I think one way we could help the students more would be by putting more hard
        work into developing a set of problems which would elucidate some of the ideas in
        the lectures. Problems give a good opportunity to fill out the material of the
        lectures and make more realistic, more complete, and more settled in the mind the
        ideas that have been exposed.
		</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Ch91-S1-p11" class="para">
		<p class="p">
		I think, however, that there isn’t any solution to this problem of education
        other than to realize that the best teaching can be done only when there is a
        direct individual relationship between a student and a good teacher—a situation
        in which the student discusses the ideas, thinks about the things, and talks
        about the things. It’s impossible to learn very much by simply sitting in a
        lecture, or even by simply doing problems that are assigned. But in our modern
        times we have so many students to teach that we have to try to find some
        substitute for the ideal. Perhaps my lectures can make some contribution. Perhaps
        in some small place where there are individual teachers and students, they may
        get some inspiration or some ideas from the lectures. Perhaps they will have fun
        thinking them through—or going on to develop some of the ideas further.
