to have discovered the fact that two similar strings under the same
tension and differing only in length, when sounded together give an
effect that is pleasant to the ear <em class="emph">if</em> the lengths of the strings
are in the ratio of two small integers. If the lengths are as one is to
two, they then correspond to the octave in music. If the lengths are as
two is to three, they correspond to the interval between $C$ and $G$,
which is called a fifth. These intervals are generally accepted as
“pleasant” sounding chords.</p>

<p class="p">Pythagoras was so impressed by
this discovery that he made it the basis of a school—Pythagoreans they
were called—which held mystic beliefs in the great powers of numbers.
It was believed that something similar would be found out about the
planets—or “spheres.” We sometimes hear the expression: “the music
of the spheres.” The idea was that there would be some numerical
relationships between the orbits of the planets or between other things
in nature. People usually think that this is just a kind of superstition
held by the Greeks. But is it so different from our own scientific
interest in quantitative relationships?
Pythagoras’ discovery was
the first example, outside geometry,
of any numerical relationship in nature. It must have been very
surprising to suddenly discover that there was a <em class="emph">fact</em> of nature
that involved a simple numerical relationship. Simple measurements of
lengths gave a prediction about something which had no apparent
connection to geometry—the production of pleasant sounds. This
discovery led to the extension that perhaps a good tool for
understanding nature would be arithmetic and mathematical analysis. The
results of modern science justify that point of view.</p>

<p class="p">Pythagoras could only have made
his discovery by making an experimental observation. Yet this important

theory of aesthetics is probably no further advanced now than in the
time of Pythagoras. In this one

<p class="p">Among the sounds that we hear, there is one kind that we call
<em class="emph">noise</em>. Noise corresponds to a sort of irregular vibration of
the eardrum that is produced by the irregular vibration of some object
in the neighborhood. If we make a diagram to indicate the pressure of
the air on the eardrum (and, therefore, the displacement of the drum)
as a function of time, the graph which corresponds to a noise might
look like that shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch50-F1">50–1</a>(a). (Such a noise
might correspond roughly to the sound of a stamped foot.) The sound of
<em class="emph">music</em> has a different character. Music is characterized by
the
presence of more-or-less <em class="emph">sustained tones</em>—or musical
“notes.” (Musical instruments may make noises as well!) The tone may
last for a relatively short time, as when a key is pressed on a piano,
or it may be sustained almost indefinitely, as when a flute player
holds a long note.</p>

that there is a periodicity in its graph. There is some uneven shape
to the variation of the air pressure with time, and the shape repeats
itself over and over again. An example of a pressure-time function

<p class="p">Musicians will usually speak of a musical tone in terms of three
characteristics: the loudness, the pitch, and the “quality.” The
“loudness” is found to correspond to the magnitude of the pressure
changes. The “pitch” corresponds to the period of time for one
repetition of the basic pressure function. (“Low” notes have longer
periods than “high” notes.) The “quality” of a tone has to do with
the differences we may still be able to hear between two notes of the
same loudness and pitch. An oboe, a violin, or a soprano are still
distinguishable even when they sound notes of the same pitch. The
quality has to do with the structure of the repeating pattern.</p>

<p class="p">Let us consider, for a moment, the sound produced by a vibrating
string. If we pluck the string, by pulling it to one side and
releasing it, the subsequent motion will be determined by the motions
of the waves we have produced. We know that these waves will travel in
both directions, and will be reflected at the ends. They will slosh
back and forth for a long time. No matter how complicated the wave is,
however, it will repeat itself. The period of repetition is just the
time $T$ required for the wave to travel two full lengths of the
string. For that is just the time required for any wave, once started,
to reflect off each end and return to its starting position, and be
proceeding in the original direction. The time is the same for waves
which start out in either direction. Each point on the string will,
then, return to its starting position after one period, and again one
period later, etc. The sound wave produced must also have the same
repetition. We see why a plucked string produces a musical tone.</p>

<div id="Ch50-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We have discussed in the preceding chapter another way of looking at
the motion of a vibrating system. We have seen that a string has
various natural modes of oscillation, and that any particular kind of
vibration that may be set up by the starting conditions can be thought
of as a combination—in suitable proportions—of several of the
natural modes, oscillating together. For a string we found that the
normal modes of oscillation had the frequencies $\omega_0$, $2\omega_0$,
$3\omega_0$, … The most general motion of a
plucked string, therefore, is composed of the sum of a sinusoidal
oscillation at the fundamental frequency $\omega_0$, another at the
second harmonic frequency $2\omega_0$, another at the third
harmonic $3\omega_0$, etc. Now the fundamental mode repeats itself every
period $T_1 = 2\pi/\omega_0$. The second harmonic mode repeats itself
every $T_2 = 2\pi/2\omega_0$. It <em class="emph">also</em> repeats itself every $T_1 =
2T_2$, after <em class="emph">two</em> of its periods. Similarly, the third harmonic
mode repeats itself after a time $T_1$ which is $3$ of its periods. We
see again why a plucked string repeats its whole pattern with a
periodicity of $T_1$. It produces a musical tone.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch50-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We have been talking about the motion of the string. But the
<em class="emph">sound</em>, which is the motion of the air, is produced by the
motion of the string, so its vibrations too must be composed of the
same harmonics—though we are no longer thinking about the normal
modes of the air. Also, the relative strength of the harmonics may be
different in the air than in the string, particularly if the string is
“coupled” to the air via a sounding board. The efficiency of the
coupling to the air is different for different harmonics.</p>

<div id="Ch50-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">If we let $f(t)$ represent the air pressure as a function of time for

harmonic functions of time—like $\cos\omega t$—for each of the
various harmonic frequencies. If the period of the vibration is $T$,
the fundamental angular frequency will be $\omega = 2\pi/T$, and the
harmonics will be $2\omega$, $3\omega$, etc.</p>

<div id="Ch50-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">There is one slight complication. For each frequency we may expect
that the starting phases will not necessarily be the same for all

cosine functions for <em class="emph">each</em> frequency. We recall that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:50:1}
\cos\,(\omega t + \phi) = (\cos\phi\cos\omega t - 
\sin\phi\sin\omega t)

where $\omega = 2\pi/T$ and the $a$’s and $b$’s are numerical
constants which tell us how much of each component oscillation is
present in the oscillation $f(t)$. We have added the
“zero-frequency” term $a_0$ so that our formula will be completely
general, although it is usually zero for a musical tone. It represents
a shift of the average value (that is, the “zero” level) of the
sound pressure. With it our formula can take care of any case. The

<p class="p">Now we are able to describe what it is that determines the “quality”
of a musical tone. It is the relative amounts of the various
harmonics—the values of the $a$’s and $b$’s. A tone with only the
first harmonic is a “pure” tone. A tone with many strong harmonics
is a “rich” tone. A violin produces a different proportion of
harmonics than does an oboe.</p>

<div id="Ch50-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We can “manufacture” various musical tones if we connect several

frequencies of the oscillators to be $\omega$, $2\omega$,
$3\omega$, etc. Then by adjusting the volume control on each oscillator, we can
add in any amount we wish of each harmonic—thereby producing tones
of different quality. An electric organ works in much this way. The
“keys” select the frequency of the fundamental oscillator and the
“stops” are switches that control the relative proportions of the
harmonics. By throwing these switches, the organ can be made to sound
like a flute, or an oboe, or a violin.</p>

mainly to the <em class="emph">total</em> of the sine and cosine parts of each
frequency. Our analysis is more accurate than is necessary to explain
the <em class="emph">subjective</em> aspect of music. The response of a microphone or

<p class="p">The “quality” of a spoken sound also determines the vowel sounds
that we recognize in speech. The shape of the mouth determines the
frequencies of the natural modes of vibration of the air in the
mouth. Some of these modes are set into vibration by the sound waves
from the vocal chords. In this way, the amplitudes of some of the
harmonics of the sound are increased with respect to others. When we
change the shape of our mouth, harmonics of different frequencies are
given preference. These effects account for the difference between an
“e–e–e” sound and an “a–a–a” sound.</p>

for an “e–e–e,” and that they <em class="emph">do not</em> change as we change

frequencies of the harmonics. The second harmonic of the lower shorter

not sound pleasant, and why unison of the upper harmonics does sound
pleasant, is something that we do not know how to define or
describe. We cannot say from this knowledge of what <em class="emph">sounds</em>
good, what ought, for example, to <em class="emph">smell</em> good. In other words,
our understanding of it is not anything more general than the

some simple experiments with a piano. Let us label the $3$ successive
C’s near the middle of the keyboard by C, C$'$, and C$''$, and the G’s
just above by G, G$'$, and G$''$. Then the fundamentals will have
relative frequencies as follows:

These harmonic relationships can be demonstrated in the following way:
Suppose we press C$'$ <em class="emph">slowly</em>—so that it does not sound but we
cause the damper to be lifted. If we then sound C, it will produce its
own fundamental <em class="emph">and</em> some second harmonic. The second harmonic
will set the strings of C$'$ into vibration. If we now release C
(keeping C$'$ pressed) the damper will stop the vibration of the C
strings, and we can hear (softly) the note C$'$ as it dies away. In a
similar way, the third harmonic of C can cause a vibration of G$'$. Or
the sixth of C (now getting much weaker) can set up a vibration in the
fundamental of G$''$.</p>

<div id="Ch50-S3-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">A somewhat different result is obtained if we press G quietly and then

B–B$'$, etc.)  has the ratio $1:2$—determine the whole scale for
the “ideal” case, or for what is called “just intonation.”
Keyboard instruments like the piano are <em class="emph">not</em> usually tuned in
this manner, but a little “fudging” is done so that the frequencies
are <em class="emph">approximately</em> correct for all possible starting tones. For
this tuning, which is called “tempered,” the octave (still $1:2$) is
divided into $12$ equal intervals for which the frequency ratio
is $(2)^{1/12}$. A fifth no longer has the frequency ratio $3/2$, but

We have shown above,

This equation is called the “energy theorem,” and says that the total energy
in a wave is just the sum of the energies in all of the Fourier components. For
example, applying this theorem to the series (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI5019">50.19</a>), since $[f(t)]^2
= 1$ we get
\begin{equation*}
T = \frac{T}{2}\cdot\biggl(\frac{4}{\pi}\biggr)^2\biggl(
1 + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{5^2} + \frac{1}{7^2} + \dotsb\biggr),
\end{equation*}
so we learn that the sum of the squares of the reciprocals of the odd integers
is $\pi^2/8$. In a similar way, by first obtaining the Fourier series for the
function $f(t)=(t-T/2)^2$ and using the energy theorem, we can prove that $1 +
1/2^4 + 1/3^4 + \dotsb$ is $\pi^4/90$, a result we needed in

<p class="p">Finally, in the theory of harmonics there is an important phenomenon
which should be remarked upon because of its practical
importance—that of nonlinear effects. In all the systems that we
have been considering so far, we have supposed that everything was
linear, that the responses to forces, say the displacements or the
accelerations, were always proportional to the forces. Or that the
currents in the circuits were proportional to the voltages, and so
on. We now wish to consider cases where there is not a strict
proportionality. We think, at the moment, of some device in which the
response, which we will call $x_{\text{out}}$ at the time $t$, is
determined by the input $x_{\text{in}}$ at the time $t$. For example,
$x_{\text{in}}$ might be the force and $x_{\text{out}}$ might be the
displacement. Or $x_{\text{in}}$ might be the current
and $x_{\text{out}}$ the voltage. If the device is linear, we would have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:50:24}
x_{\text{out}}(t) = Kx_{\text{in}}(t),
\end{equation}
where $K$ is a constant independent of $t$ and
of $x_{\text{in}}$. Suppose, however, that the device is nearly, but not
exactly, linear, so that we can write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:50:25}
x_{\text{out}}(t) = K[x_{\text{in}}(t) + \epsilon x_{\text{in}}^2(t)],
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon$ is small in comparison with unity. Such linear and
nonlinear responses are shown in the graphs of Fig. <a href="#Ch50-F4">50–4</a>.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch50-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Nonlinear responses have several important practical consequences. We
shall discuss some of them now. First we consider what happens if we
apply a pure tone at the input. We let $x_{\text{in}} = \cos\omega
t$. If we plot $x_{\text{out}}$ as a function of time we get the solid
curve shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch50-F5">50–5</a>. The dashed curve gives, for
comparison, the response of a linear system. We see that the output is
no longer a cosine function. It is more peaked at the top and flatter
at the bottom. We say that the output is <em class="emph">distorted</em>. We know,
however, that such a wave is no longer a pure tone, that it will have
harmonics. We can find what the harmonics are. Using $x_{\text{in}} =
\cos\omega t$ with Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI5025">50.25</a>), we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:50:26}
x_{\text{out}}(t) = K(\cos\omega t + \epsilon\cos^2\omega t).
\end{equation}
From the equality $\cos^2\theta = \tfrac{1}{2}(1 + \cos2\theta)$, we
have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:50:27}
x_{\text{out}}(t) = K\Bigl(\cos\omega t + \frac{\epsilon}{2} +
\frac{\epsilon}{2}\cos2\omega t\Bigr).
\end{equation}
The output has not only a component at the fundamental frequency, that
was present at the input, but also has some of its second
harmonic. There has also appeared at the output a constant
term $K(\epsilon/2)$, which corresponds to the shift of the average value,
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch50-F5">50–5</a>. The process of producing a shift of
the average value is called <em class="emph">rectification</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch50-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">A nonlinear response will rectify and will produce harmonics of the
frequencies at its input. Although the nonlinearity we assumed
produced only second harmonics, nonlinearities of higher order—those

example—will produce harmonics higher than the second.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch50-S6-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Another effect which results from a nonlinear response is
<em class="emph">modulation</em>. If our input function contains two (or more) pure
tones, the output will have not only their harmonics, but still other
frequency components. Let $x_{\text{in}} = A\cos\omega_1t +
B\cos\omega_2t$, where now $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are <em class="emph">not</em>
intended to be in a harmonic relation. In addition to the linear term
(which is $K$ times the input) we shall have a component in the output
given by

<p class="p">We can look at this new “cross term” $AB\cos\omega_1t\cos\omega_2t$
in two ways. First, if the two frequencies are widely different (for
example, if $\omega_1$ is much greater than $\omega_2$) we can
consider that the cross term represents a cosine oscillation of
varying amplitude. That is, we can think of the factors in this way:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:50:30}
AB\cos\omega_1t\cos\omega_2t = C(t)\cos\omega_1t,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:50:31}
C(t)=AB\cos\omega_2t.

We say that the amplitude of $\cos\omega_1t$ is <i>modulated</i> with the
frequency $\omega_2$.</p>

x$. Second, we expand the integrand in a series $1/(1 + x^2) = 1 - x^2
