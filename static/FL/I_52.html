<div id="Ch52-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">The subject of this chapter is what we may call
<em class="emph">symmetry in physical laws</em>. We have already discussed certain
features of symmetry in physical laws in connection with vector analysis
(Chapter <a href="I_11.html">11</a>), the theory of relativity
(Chapter <a href="I_16.html">16</a>), and rotation (Chapter <a href="I_20.html">20</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Why should we be concerned with symmetry? In the first place, symmetry
is fascinating to the human mind, and everyone likes objects or patterns
that are in some way symmetrical. It is an interesting fact that nature
often exhibits certain kinds of symmetry in the objects we find in the
world around us. Perhaps the most symmetrical object imaginable is a
sphere, and nature is full of spheres—stars, planets, water droplets
in clouds. The crystals found in rocks exhibit many different kinds of
symmetry, the study of which tells us some important things about the
structure of solids. Even the animal and vegetable worlds show some
degree of symmetry, although the symmetry of a flower or of a bee is not
as perfect or as fundamental as is that of a crystal.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">But our main concern here is not with the fact that the <em class="emph">objects</em>
of nature are often symmetrical. Rather, we wish to examine some of the
even more remarkable symmetries of the universe—the symmetries that
exist in the <em class="emph">basic laws themselves</em> which govern the operation of
the physical world.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">First, what <em class="emph">is</em> symmetry? How can a physical <em class="emph">law</em> be
“symmetrical”? The problem of defining symmetry is an interesting one
and we have already noted that Weyl gave a good definition, the substance of which is that a
thing is symmetrical if there is something we can do to it so that after
we have done it, it looks the same as it did before. For example, a
symmetrical vase is of such a kind that if we reflect or turn it, it
will look the same as it did before. The question we wish to consider
here is what we can do to physical phenomena, or to a physical situation
in an experiment, and yet leave the result the same. A list of the known
operations under which various physical phenomena remain invariant is
shown in Table <a href="#Ch52-T1">52–1</a>.</p>

<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">52–2</span>Symmetry in space and time</h3>
<div id="Ch52-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">The first thing we might try to do, for example, is to <em class="emph">translate</em>
the phenomenon in space. If we do an experiment in a certain region, and
then build another apparatus at another place in space (or move the
original one over) then, whatever went on in one apparatus, in a certain
order in time, will occur in the same way if we have arranged the same
condition, with all due attention to the restrictions that we mentioned
before: that all of those features of the environment which make it not
behave the same way have also been moved over—we talked about how to
define how much we should include in those circumstances, and we shall
not go into those details again.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">In the same way, we also believe today that <em class="emph">displacement in time</em>
will have no effect on physical laws. (That is, <em class="emph">as far as we know
today</em>—all of these things are as far as we know today!) That means
that if we build a certain apparatus and start it at a certain time, say
on Thursday at 10:00 a.m., and then build the same apparatus and start
it, say, three days later in the same condition, the two apparatuses
will go through the same motions in exactly the same way as a function
of time no matter what the starting time, provided again, of course,
that the relevant features of the environment are also modified
appropriately in <em class="emph">time</em>. That symmetry means, of course, that if
one bought General Motors stock three months ago, the same thing would
happen to it if he bought it now!</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We have to watch out for geographical differences too, for there are, of
course, variations in the characteristics of the earth’s surface. So,
for example, if we measure the magnetic field in a certain region and
move the apparatus to some other region, it may not work in precisely
the same way because the magnetic field is different, but we say that is
because the magnetic field is associated with the earth. We can imagine
that if we move the whole earth and the equipment, it would make no
difference in the operation of the apparatus.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Another thing that we discussed in considerable detail was rotation in
space: if we turn an apparatus at an angle it works just as well,
provided we turn everything else that is relevant along with it. In
fact, we discussed the problem of symmetry under rotation in space in
some detail in Chapter <a href="I_11.html">11</a>, and we invented a mathematical
system called <em class="emph">vector analysis</em> to handle it as neatly as possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">On a more advanced level we had another symmetry—the symmetry under
uniform velocity in a straight line. That is to say—a rather
remarkable effect—that if we have a piece of apparatus working a
certain way and then take the same apparatus and put it in a car, and
move the whole car, plus all the relevant surroundings, at a uniform
velocity in a straight line, then so far as the phenomena inside the car
are concerned there is no difference: all the laws of physics appear the
same. We even know how to express this more technically, and that is
that the mathematical equations of the physical laws must be unchanged
under a <em class="emph">Lorentz
transformation</em>. As a matter of
fact, it was a study of the relativity problem that concentrated
physicists’ attention most sharply on symmetry in physical laws.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Now the above-mentioned symmetries have all been of a geometrical
nature, time and space being more or less the same, but there are other
symmetries of a different kind. For example, there is a symmetry which
describes the fact that we can replace one atom by another of the same
kind; to put it differently, there <em class="emph">are</em> atoms of the same kind. It
is possible to find groups of atoms such that if we change a pair
around, it makes no difference—the atoms are identical. Whatever one
atom of oxygen of a certain type will do, another atom of oxygen of that
type will do. One may say, “That is ridiculous, that is the
<em class="emph">definition</em> of equal types!” That may be merely the definition,
but then we still do not know whether there <em class="emph">are</em> any “atoms of
the same type”; the <em class="emph">fact</em> is that there are many, many atoms of
the same type. Thus it does mean something to say that it makes no
difference if we replace one atom by another of the same type. The
so-called elementary particles of which the atoms are made are also
identical particles in the above sense—all electrons are the same; all
protons are the same; all positive pions are the same; and so on.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">After such a long list of things that can be done without changing the
phenomena, one might think we could do practically anything; so let us
give some examples to the contrary, just to see the difference. Suppose
that we ask: “Are the physical laws symmetrical under a change of
scale?” Suppose we build a certain piece of apparatus, and then build
another apparatus five times bigger in every part, will it work exactly
the same way? The answer is, in this case, <em class="emph">no</em>! The wavelength of
light emitted, for example, by the atoms inside one box of sodium atoms
and the wavelength of light emitted by a gas of sodium atoms five times
in volume is not five times longer, but is in fact exactly the same as
the other. So the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the emitter
will change.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Another example: we see in the newspaper, every once in a while pictures
of a great cathedral made with little matchsticks—a tremendous work of
art by some retired fellow who keeps gluing matchsticks together. It is
much more elaborate and wonderful than any real cathedral. If we imagine
that this wooden cathedral were actually built on the scale of a real
cathedral, we see where the trouble is; it would not last—the whole
thing would collapse because of the fact that scaled-up matchsticks are
just not strong enough. “Yes,” one might say, “but we also know that
when there is an influence from the outside, it also must be changed in
proportion!” We are talking about the ability of the object to
withstand gravitation. So what we should do is first to take the model
cathedral of real matchsticks and the real earth, and then we know it is
stable. Then we should take the larger cathedral and take a bigger
earth. But then it is even worse, because the gravitation is increased
still more!</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S2-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Today, of course, we understand the fact that phenomena depend on the
scale on the grounds that matter is atomic in nature, and certainly if
we built an apparatus that was so small there were only five atoms in
it, it would clearly be something we could not scale up and down
arbitrarily. The scale of an individual atom is not at all
arbitrary—it is quite definite.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S2-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">The fact that the laws of physics are not unchanged under a change of
scale was discovered by Galileo.
He realized that the strengths of materials were not in exactly the
right proportion to their sizes, and he illustrated this property that
we were just discussing, about the cathedral of matchsticks, by drawing
two bones, the bone of one dog, in the right proportion for holding up
his weight, and the imaginary bone of a “super dog” that would be,
say, ten or a hundred times bigger—that bone was a big, solid thing
with quite different proportions. We do not know whether he ever carried
the argument quite to the conclusion that the laws of nature must have a
definite scale, but he was so impressed with this discovery that he
considered it to be as important as the discovery of the laws of motion,
because he published them both in the same volume, called “On Two New
Sciences.”</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S2-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">Another example in which the laws are not symmetrical, that we know
quite well, is this: a system in rotation at a uniform angular velocity
does not give the same apparent laws as one that is not rotating. If we
make an experiment and then put everything in a space ship and have the
space ship spinning in empty space, all alone at a constant angular
velocity, the apparatus will not work the same way because, as we know,
things inside the equipment will be thrown to the outside, and so on, by
the centrifugal
or Coriolis forces,
etc. In fact, we can tell that the earth is rotating by using a
so-called Foucault pendulum, without looking outside.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S2-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">Next we mention a very interesting symmetry which is obviously false,
i.e., <em class="emph">reversibility in time</em>. The physical laws apparently cannot
be reversible in time, because, as we know, all obvious phenomena are
irreversible on a large scale: “The moving finger writes, and having
writ, moves on.” So far as we can tell, this irreversibility is due to
the very large number of particles involved, and if we could see the
individual molecules, we would not be able to discern whether the
machinery was working forward or backwards. To make it more precise: we
build a small apparatus in which we know what all the atoms are doing,
in which we can watch them jiggling. Now we build another apparatus like
it, but which starts its motion in the final condition of the other one,
with all the velocities precisely reversed. <em class="emph">It will then go
through the same motions, but exactly in reverse</em>. Putting it another
way: if we take a motion picture, with sufficient detail, of all the
inner works of a piece of material and shine it on a screen and run it
backwards, no physicist will be able to say, “That is against the laws
of physics, that is doing something wrong!” If we do not see all the
details, of course, the situation will be perfectly clear. If we see the
egg splattering on the sidewalk and the shell cracking open, and so on,
then we will surely say, “That is irreversible, because if we run the
moving picture backwards the egg will all collect together and the shell
will go back together, and that is obviously ridiculous!” But if we
look at the individual atoms themselves, the laws look completely
reversible. This is, of course, a much harder discovery to have made,
but apparently it is true that the fundamental physical laws, on a
microscopic and fundamental level, are completely reversible in time!</p>

<span class="tag">52–3</span>Symmetry and conservation laws</h3>
<div id="Ch52-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">The symmetries of the physical laws are very interesting at this level,
but they turn out, in the end, to be even more interesting and exciting
when we come to quantum mechanics. For a reason which we cannot make
clear at the level of the present discussion—a fact that most
physicists still find somewhat staggering, a most profound and beautiful
thing, is that, in quantum mechanics, <em class="emph">for each of the rules of
symmetry there is a corresponding conservation law;</em> there is a definite
connection between the laws of conservation and the symmetries of
physical laws. We can only state this at present, without any attempt at
explanation.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">The fact, for example, that the laws are symmetrical for translation in
space when we add the principles of quantum mechanics, turns out to mean
that <em class="emph">momentum is conserved</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S3-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">That the laws are symmetrical under translation in time means, in
quantum mechanics, that <em class="emph">energy is conserved</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S3-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Invariance under rotation through a fixed angle in space corresponds to
the <em class="emph">conservation of angular momentum</em>. These connections are very
interesting and beautiful things, among the most beautiful and profound
things in physics.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Incidentally, there are a number of symmetries which appear in quantum
mechanics which have no classical analog, which have no method of
description in classical physics. One of these is as follows: If $\psi$
is the amplitude for some process or other, we know that the absolute
square of $\psi$ is the probability that the process will occur. Now if
someone else were to make his calculations, not with this $\psi$, but
with a $\psi'$ which differs merely by a change in phase (let $\Delta$
be some constant, and multiply $e^{i\Delta}$ times the old $\psi$), the
absolute square of $\psi'$, which is the probability of the event, is
then equal to the absolute square of $\psi$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:52:1}
\psi' = \psi e^{i\Delta};\quad
\abs{\psi'}^2 = \abs{\psi}^2.
\end{equation}
Therefore the physical laws are unchanged if the phase of the wave
function is shifted by an arbitrary constant. That is another symmetry.
Physical laws must be of such a nature that a shift in the
quantum-mechanical phase makes no difference. As we have just mentioned,
in quantum mechanics there is a conservation law for every symmetry. The
conservation law which is connected with the quantum-mechanical phase
seems to be the <em class="emph">conservation of electrical charge</em>. This is
altogether a very interesting business!</p>

<div id="Ch52-S4" class="section">
<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">52–4</span>Mirror reflections</h3>
<div id="Ch52-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now the next question, which is going to concern us for most of the rest
of this chapter, is the question of symmetry under <em class="emph">reflection in
space</em>. The problem is this: Are the physical laws symmetrical under
reflection? We may put it this way: Suppose we build a piece of
equipment, let us say a clock, with lots of wheels and hands and
numbers; it ticks, it works, and it has things wound up inside. We look
at the clock in the mirror. How it <em class="emph">looks</em> in the mirror is not the
question. But let us actually <em class="emph">build</em> another clock which is
exactly the same as the first clock looks in the mirror—every time
there is a screw with a right-hand thread in one, we use a screw with a
left-hand thread in the corresponding place of the other; where one is
marked “$2$” on the face, we mark a “<img src="img/mirror_2.svgz" class="reflectbox">” on the face
of the other; each coiled spring is twisted one way in one clock and the
other way in the mirror-image clock; when we are all finished, we have
two clocks, both physical, which bear to each other the relation of an
object and its mirror image, although they are both actual, material
objects, we emphasize. Now the question is: If the two clocks are
started in the same condition, the springs wound to corresponding
tightnesses, will the two clocks tick and go around, forever after, as
exact mirror images? (This is a physical question, not a philosophical
question.) Our intuition about the laws of physics would suggest that
they <em class="emph">would</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We would suspect that, at least in the case of these clocks, reflection
in space is one of the symmetries of physical laws, that if we change
everything from “right” to “left” and leave it otherwise the same,
we cannot tell the difference. Let us, then, suppose for a moment that
this is true. If it is true, then it would be impossible to distinguish
“right” and “left” by any physical phenomenon, just as it is, for
example, impossible to define a particular absolute velocity by a
physical phenomenon. So it should be impossible, by any physical
phenomenon, to define absolutely what we mean by “right” as opposed to
“left,” because the physical laws should be symmetrical.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Of course, the world does not <em class="emph">have</em> to be symmetrical. For
example, using what we may call “geography,” surely “right” can be
defined. For instance, we stand in New Orleans and look at Chicago, and
Florida is to our right (when our feet are on the ground!). So we can
define “right” and “left” by geography. Of course, the actual
situation in any system does not have to have the symmetry that we are
talking about; it is a question of whether the <em class="emph">laws</em> are
symmetrical—in other words, whether it is <em class="emph">against the physical
laws</em> to have a sphere like the earth with “left-handed dirt” on it
and a person like ourselves standing looking at a city like Chicago from
a place like New Orleans, but with everything the other way around, so
Florida is on the other side. It clearly seems not impossible, not
against the physical laws, to have everything changed left for right.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Another point is that our definition of “right” should not depend on
history. An easy way to distinguish right from left is to go to a
machine shop and pick up a screw at random. The odds are it has a
right-hand thread—not necessarily, but it is much more likely to have
a right-hand thread than a left-hand one. This is a question of history
or convention, or the way things happen to be, and is again not a
question of fundamental laws. As we can well appreciate, everyone could
have started out making left-handed screws!</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">So we must try to find some phenomenon in which “right hand” is
involved fundamentally. The next possibility we discuss is the fact that
polarized light rotates its plane of polarization as it goes through,
say, sugar water. As we saw in Chapter <a href="I_33.html">33</a>, it rotates, let
us say, to the right in a certain sugar solution. That is a way of
defining “right-hand,” because we may dissolve some sugar in the water
and then the polarization goes to the right. But sugar has come from
living things, and if we try to make the sugar artificially, then we
discover that it <em class="emph">does not</em> rotate the plane of polarization!  But
if we then take that same sugar which is made artificially and which
does not rotate the plane of polarization, and put bacteria in it (they
eat some of the sugar) and then filter out the bacteria, we find that we
still have sugar left (almost half as much as we had before), and this
time it does rotate the plane of polarization, but <em class="emph">the other way</em>!
It seems very confusing, but is easily explained.</p>

<div id="Ch52-F1" class="figure">
<img src="img/FLP_I/f52-01/f52-01_small.jpg"><div class="caption">
<span class="tag">Fig. 52–1.</span>(a) L-alanine (left), and (b) D-alanine (right).
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S4-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Take another example: One of the substances which is common to all
living creatures and that is fundamental to life is protein. Proteins
consist of chains of amino acids. Figure <a href="#Ch52-F1">52–1</a> shows a model
of an amino acid that comes out of a protein. This amino acid is called
alanine, and the molecular arrangement would look like that in
Fig. <a href="#Ch52-F1">52–1</a>(a) if it came out of a protein of a real living
thing. On the other hand, if we try to make alanine from carbon dioxide,
ethane, and ammonia (and we <em class="emph">can</em> make it, it is not a complicated
molecule), we discover that we are making equal amounts of this molecule
and the one shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch52-F1">52–1</a>(b)! The first molecule, the
one that comes from the living thing, is called <em class="emph">L-alanine</em>. The
other one, which is the same chemically, in that it has the same kinds
of atoms and the same connections of the atoms, is a “right-hand”
molecule, compared with the “left-hand” L-alanine, and it is called
<em class="emph">D-alanine</em>. The interesting thing is that when we make alanine at
home in a laboratory from simple gases, we get an equal mixture of both
kinds. However, the only thing that life uses is L-alanine. (This is not
exactly true. Here and there in living creatures there is a special use
for D-alanine, but it is very rare. All proteins use L-alanine
exclusively.) Now if we make both kinds, and we feed the mixture to some
animal which likes to “eat,” or use up, alanine, it cannot use
D-alanine, so it only uses the L-alanine; that is what happened to our
sugar—after the bacteria eat the sugar that works well for them, only
the “wrong” kind is left! (Left-handed sugar tastes sweet, but not the
same as right-handed sugar.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S4-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">So it looks as though the phenomena of life permit a distinction between
“right” and “left,” or chemistry permits a distinction, because the
two molecules are chemically different. But no, it does not! So far as
physical measurements can be made, such as of energy, the rates of
chemical reactions, and so on, the two kinds work exactly the same way
if we make everything else in a mirror image too. One molecule will
rotate light to the right, and the other will rotate it to the left in
precisely the same amount, through the same amount of fluid. Thus, so
far as physics is concerned, these two amino acids are equally
satisfactory. So far as we understand things today, the fundamentals of
the Schrödinger equation have it that the two molecules should behave in
exactly corresponding ways, so that one is to the right as the other is
to the left. Nevertheless, in life it is all one way!</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S4-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">It is presumed that the reason for this is the following. Let us
suppose, for example, that life is somehow at one moment in a certain
condition in which all the proteins in some creatures have left-handed
amino acids, and all the enzymes are lopsided—every substance in the
living creature is lopsided—it is not symmetrical. So when the
digestive enzymes try to change the chemicals in the food from one kind
to another, one kind of chemical “fits” into the enzyme, but the other
kind does not (like Cinderella and the slipper, except that it is a
“left foot” that we are testing). So far as we know, in principle, we
could build a frog, for example, in which every molecule is reversed,
everything is like the “left-hand” mirror image of a real frog; we
have a left-hand frog. This left-hand frog would go on all right for a
while, but he would find nothing to eat, because if he swallows a fly,
his enzymes are not built to digest it. The fly has the wrong “kind”
of amino acids (unless we give him a left-hand fly). So as far as we
know, the chemical and life processes would continue in the same manner
if everything were reversed.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S4-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">If life is entirely a physical and chemical phenomenon, then we can
understand that the proteins are all made in the same corkscrew only
from the idea that at the very beginning some living molecules, by
accident, got started and a few won. Somewhere, once, one organic
molecule was lopsided in a certain way, and from this particular thing
the “right” happened to evolve in our particular geography; a
particular historical accident was one-sided, and ever since then the
lopsidedness has propagated itself. Once having arrived at the state
that it is in now, of course, it will always continue—all the enzymes
digest the right things, manufacture the right things: when the carbon
dioxide and the water vapor, and so on, go in the plant leaves, the
enzymes that make the sugars make them lopsided because the enzymes are
lopsided. If any new kind of virus or living thing were to originate at
a later time, it would survive only if it could “eat” the kind of
living matter already present. Thus it, too, must be of the same kind.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S4-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">There is no conservation of the number of right-handed molecules. Once
started, we could keep increasing the number of right-handed molecules.
So the presumption is, then, that the phenomena in the case of life do
not show a lack of symmetry in physical laws, but do show, on the
contrary, the universal nature and the commonness of ultimate origin of
all creatures on earth, in the sense described above.</p>

<span class="tag">52–5</span>Polar and axial vectors</h3>
<div id="Ch52-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we go further. We observe that in physics there are a lot of other
places where we have “right” and “left” hand rules. As a matter of
fact, when we learned about vector analysis we learned about the
right-hand rules we have to use in order to get the angular momentum,
torque, magnetic field, and so on, to come out right. The force on a
charge moving in a magnetic field, for example, is $\FLPF =
q\FLPv\times\FLPB$. In a given situation, in which we know
$\FLPF$, $\FLPv$, and $\FLPB$, isn’t that equation enough to define
right-handedness?  As a matter of fact, if we go back and look at where
the vectors came from, we know that the “right-hand rule” was merely a
convention; it was a trick. The original quantities, like the angular
momenta and the angular velocities, and things of this kind, were not
really vectors at all! They are all somehow associated with a certain
plane, and it is just because there are three dimensions in space that
we can associate the quantity with a direction perpendicular to that
plane. Of the two possible directions, we chose the “right-hand”
direction.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">So if the laws of physics are symmetrical, we should find that if some
demon were to sneak into all the physics laboratories and replace the
word “right” for “left” in every book in which “right-hand rules”
are given, and instead we were to use all “left-hand rules,”
uniformly, then it should make no difference whatever in the physical
laws.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Let us give an illustration. There are two kinds of vectors. There are
“honest” vectors, for example a step $\FLPr$ in space. If in our
apparatus there is a piece here and something else there, then in a
mirror apparatus there will be the image piece and the image something
else, and if we draw a vector from the “piece” to the “something
else,” one vector is the mirror image of the other
(Fig. <a href="#Ch52-F2">52–2</a>). The vector arrow changes its head, just as the
whole space turns inside out; such a vector we call a <em class="emph">polar
vector</em>.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch52-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">But the other kind of vector, which has to do with rotations, is of a
different nature. For example, suppose that in three dimensions
something is rotating as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch52-F3">52–3</a>. Then if we look
at it in a mirror, it will be rotating as indicated, namely, as the
mirror image of the original rotation. Now we have agreed to represent
the mirror rotation by the same rule, it is a “vector” which, on
reflection, does <em class="emph">not</em> change about as the polar vector does, but
is reversed relative to the polar vectors and to the geometry of the
space; such a vector is called an <em class="emph">axial vector</em>.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch52-S5-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now if the law of reflection symmetry is right in physics, then it must
be true that the equations must be so designed that if we change the
sign of each axial vector and each cross-product of
vectors, which would be what corresponds to reflection, nothing will
happen. For instance, when we write a formula which says that the
angular momentum is $\FLPL = \FLPr\times\FLPp$, that equation is all
right, because if we change to a left-hand coordinate system, we change
the sign of $\FLPL$, but $\FLPp$ and $\FLPr$ do not change; the
cross-product sign is changed, since we must change from a right-hand
rule to a left-hand rule. As another example, we know that the force on
a charge moving in a magnetic field is $\FLPF = q\FLPv\times\FLPB$, but
if we change from a right- to a left-handed system, since $\FLPF$
and $\FLPv$ are known to be polar vectors the sign change required by
the cross-product must be cancelled by a sign change in $\FLPB$, which
means that $\FLPB$ must be an axial vector. In other
words, if we make such a reflection, $\FLPB$ must go to $-\FLPB$. So if
we change our coordinates from right to left, we must also change the
poles of magnets from north to south.

</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S5-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Let us see how that works in an example. Suppose that we have two
magnets, as in Fig. <a href="#Ch52-F4">52–4</a>. One is a magnet with the coils
going around a certain way, and with current in a given direction. The
other magnet looks like the reflection of the first magnet in a
mirror—the coil will wind the other way, everything that happens
inside the coil is exactly reversed, and the current goes as shown. Now,
from the laws for the production of magnetic fields, which we do not
know yet officially, but which we most likely learned in high school, it
turns out that the magnetic field is as shown in the figure. In one case
the pole is a south magnetic pole, while in the other magnet the current
is going the other way and the magnetic field is reversed—it is a
north magnetic pole. So we see that when we go from right to left we
must indeed change from north to south!</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S5-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Never mind changing north to south; these too are mere conventions. Let
us talk about <em class="emph">phenomena</em>. Suppose, now, that we have an electron
moving through one field, going into the page. Then, if we use the
formula for the force, $\FLPv\times\FLPB$ (remember the charge is
minus), we find that the electron will deviate in the indicated
direction according to the physical law. So the phenomenon is that we
have a coil with a current going in a specified sense and an electron
curves in a certain way—that is the physics—never mind how we label
everything.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S5-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let us do the same experiment with a mirror: we send an electron
through in a corresponding direction and now the force is reversed, if
we calculate it from the same rule, and that is very good because the
corresponding <em class="emph">motions</em> are then mirror images!</p>

<span class="tag">52–6</span>Which hand is right?</h3>
<div id="Ch52-S6-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">So the fact of the matter is that in studying any phenomenon there are
always two right-hand rules, or an even number of them, and the net
result is that the phenomena always look symmetrical. In short,
therefore, we cannot tell right from left if we also are not able to
tell north from south. However, it may seem that we <em class="emph">can</em> tell the
north pole of a magnet. The north pole of a compass needle, for example,
is one that points to the north. But of course that is again a local
property that has to do with geography of the earth; that is just like
talking about in which direction is Chicago, so it does not count. If we
have seen compass needles, we may have noticed that the north-seeking
pole is a sort of bluish color. But that is just due to the man who
painted the magnet. These are all local, conventional criteria.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">However, if a magnet were to have the property that if we looked at it
closely enough we would see small hairs growing on its north pole but
not on its south pole, if that were the general rule, or if there were
<em class="emph">any</em> unique way to distinguish the north from the south pole of a
magnet, then we could tell which of the two cases we actually had, and
<em class="emph">that would be the end of the law of reflection symmetry</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">To illustrate the whole problem still more clearly, imagine that we were
talking to a Martian, or someone very far away, by telephone. We are not
allowed to send him any actual samples to inspect; for instance, if we
could send light, we could send him right-hand circularly polarized
light and say, “That is right-hand light—just watch the way it is
going.” But we cannot <em class="emph">give</em> him anything, we can only talk to
him. He is far away, or in some strange location, and he cannot see
anything we can see. For instance, we cannot say, “Look at Ursa major;
now see how those stars are arranged. What we mean by ‘right’ is
…” We are only allowed to telephone him.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S6-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we want to tell him all about us. Of course, first we start defining
numbers, and say, “Tick, tick, <em class="emph">two</em>, tick, tick, tick,
<em class="emph">three</em>, …,” so that gradually he can understand a couple of
words, and so on. After a while we may become very familiar with this
fellow, and he says, “What do you guys look like?” We start to
describe ourselves, and say, “Well, we are six feet tall.” He says,
“Wait a minute, what is six feet?” Is it possible to tell him what six
feet is? Certainly!  We say, “You know about the diameter of hydrogen
atoms—we are $17{,}000{,}000{,}000$ hydrogen atoms high!” That is
possible because physical laws are not invariant under change of scale,
and therefore we <em class="emph">can</em> define an absolute length. And so we define
the size of the body, and tell him what the general shape is—it has
prongs with five bumps sticking out on the ends, and so on, and he
follows us along, and we finish describing how we look on the outside,
presumably without encountering any particular difficulties. He is even
making a model of us as we go along. He says, “My, you are certainly
very handsome fellows; now what is on the inside?” So we start to
describe the various organs on the inside, and we come to the heart, and
we carefully describe the shape of it, and say, “Now put the heart on
the left side.” He says, “Duhhh—the left side?” Now our problem is
to describe to him which side the heart goes on without his ever seeing
anything that we see, and without our ever sending any sample to him of
what we mean by “right”—no standard right-handed object. Can we do
it?</p>

<span class="tag">52–7</span>Parity is not conserved!</h3>
<div id="Ch52-S7-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">It turns out that the laws of gravitation, the laws of electricity and
magnetism, nuclear forces, all satisfy the principle of reflection
symmetry, so these laws, or anything derived from them, cannot be used.
But associated with the many particles that are found in nature there is
a phenomenon called <em class="emph">beta decay</em>, or <em class="emph">weak decay</em>. One of the
examples of weak decay, in connection with a particle discovered in
about 1954, posed a strange puzzle. There was a certain charged particle
which disintegrated into three $\pi$-mesons, as shown schematically in
Fig. <a href="#Ch52-F5">52–5</a>. This particle was called, for a while, a
$\tau$-meson. Now in Fig. <a href="#Ch52-F5">52–5</a> we also see another particle
which disintegrates into <em class="emph">two</em> mesons; one must be neutral, from
the conservation of charge. This particle was called a $\theta$-meson.
So on the one hand we have a particle called a $\tau$, which
disintegrates into three $\pi$-mesons, and a $\theta$, which
disintegrates into two $\pi$-mesons. Now it was soon discovered that
the $\tau$ and the $\theta$ are almost equal in mass; in fact, within
the experimental error, they are equal. Next, the length of time it took
for them to disintegrate into three $\pi$’s and two $\pi$’s was found to
be almost exactly the same; they live the same length of time. Next,
whenever they were made, they were made in the same proportions, say,
$14$ percent $\tau$’s to $86$ percent $\theta$’s.</p>

<p class="p">Anyone in his right mind realizes immediately that they must be the same
particle, that we merely produce an object which has two different ways
of disintegrating—not two different particles. This object that can
disintegrate in two different ways has, therefore, the same lifetime and
the same production ratio (because this is simply the ratio of the odds
with which it disintegrates into these two kinds).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S7-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">However, it was possible to prove (and we cannot here explain at all
<em class="emph">how</em>), from the principle of reflection symmetry in quantum
mechanics, that it was <em class="emph">impossible</em> to have these both come from
the same particle—the same particle <em class="emph">could not</em> disintegrate in
both of these ways. The conservation law corresponding to the principle
of reflection symmetry is something which has no classical analog, and
so this kind of quantum-mechanical conservation was called the
<em class="emph">conservation of parity</em>. So, it was a result of the conservation
of parity or, more precisely, from the symmetry of the
quantum-mechanical equations of the weak decays under reflection, that
the same particle could not go into both, so it must be some kind of
coincidence of masses, lifetimes, and so on. But the more it was
studied, the more remarkable the coincidence, and the suspicion
gradually grew that possibly the deep law of the reflection symmetry of
nature may be false.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S7-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">As a result of this apparent failure, the physicists Lee and Yang
suggested that other experiments be done in related decays to try to
test whether the law was correct in other cases. The first such
experiment was carried out by Miss Wu from Columbia, and was done as
follows. Using a very strong magnet at a very low temperature, it turns
out that a certain isotope of cobalt, which
disintegrates by emitting an electron, is magnetic, and if the
temperature is low enough that the thermal oscillations do not jiggle
the atomic magnets about too much, they line up in the magnetic field.
So the cobalt atoms will all line up in this strong field. They then
disintegrate, emitting an electron, and it was discovered that when the
atoms were lined up in a field whose $\FLPB$ vector points upward, most
of the electrons were emitted in a downward direction.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S7-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">If one is not really “hep” to the world, such a remark does not sound
like anything of significance, but if one appreciates the problems and
interesting things in the world, then he sees that it is a most dramatic
discovery: When we put cobalt atoms in an extremely strong magnetic
field, more disintegration electrons go down than up. Therefore if we
were to put it in a corresponding experiment in a “mirror,” in which
the cobalt atoms would be lined up in the opposite direction, they would
spit their electrons <em class="emph">up</em>, not <em class="emph">down;</em> the action is
<em class="emph">unsymmetrical</em>. <em class="emph">The magnet has grown hairs!</em>  The south pole
of a magnet is of such a kind that the electrons in a
$\beta$-disintegration tend to go away from it; that distinguishes, in a
physical way, the north pole from the south pole.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S7-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">After this, a lot of other experiments were done: the disintegration of
the $\pi$ into $\mu$ and $\nu$; $\mu$ into an electron and two
neutrinos; nowadays, the $\Lambda$ into proton and $\pi$; disintegration
of $\Sigma$’s; and many other disintegrations. In fact, in almost all
cases where it could be expected, all have been found <em class="emph">not</em> to obey
reflection symmetry!  Fundamentally, the law of reflection symmetry, at
this level in physics, is incorrect.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S7-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">In short, we can tell a Martian where to put the heart: we say,
“Listen, build yourself a magnet, and put the coils in, and put the
current on, and then take some cobalt and lower the temperature. Arrange
the experiment so the electrons go from the foot to the head, then the
direction in which the current goes through the coils is the direction
that goes in on what we call the right and comes out on the left.”  So
it is possible to define right and left, now, by doing an experiment of
this kind.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S7-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">There are a lot of other features that were predicted. For example, it
turns out that the spin, the angular momentum, of the cobalt nucleus
before disintegration is $5$ units of $\hbar$, and after disintegration
it is $4$ units. The electron carries spin angular momentum, and there
is also a neutrino involved. It is easy to see from this that the
electron must carry its spin angular momentum aligned along its
direction of motion, the neutrino likewise. So it looks as though the
electron is spinning to the left, and that was also checked. In fact, it
was checked right here at Caltech by Boehm and Wapstra,
that the electrons spin mostly to the left. (There were some other
experiments that gave the opposite answer, but they were wrong!)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S7-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">The next problem, of course, was to find the law of the failure of
parity conservation. What is the rule that tells us how strong the
failure is going to be? The rule is this: it occurs only in these very
slow reactions, called weak decays, and when it occurs, the rule is that
the particles which carry spin, like the electron, neutrino, and so on,
come out with a spin tending to the left. That is a lopsided rule; it
connects a polar vector velocity and an axial vector
angular momentum, and says that the angular momentum is more likely to
be opposite to the velocity than along it.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S7-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Now that is the rule, but today we do not really understand the whys and
wherefores of it. <em class="emph">Why</em> is this the right rule, what is the
fundamental reason for it, and how is it connected to anything else? At
the moment we have been so shocked by the fact that this thing is
unsymmetrical that we have not been able to recover enough to understand
what it means with regard to all the other rules. However, the subject
is interesting, modern, and still unsolved, so it seems appropriate that
we discuss some of the questions associated with it.</p>

<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">52–8</span>Antimatter</h3>
<div id="Ch52-S8-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">The first thing to do when one of the symmetries is lost is to
immediately go back over the list of known or assumed symmetries and ask
whether any of the others are lost. Now we did not mention one operation
on our list, which must necessarily be questioned, and that is the
relation between matter and antimatter. Dirac predicted that in addition to electrons there
must be another particle, called the positron (discovered at Caltech by
Anderson), that is necessarily
related to the electron. All the properties of these two particles obey
certain rules of correspondence: the energies are equal; the masses are
equal; the charges are reversed; but, more important than anything, the
two of them, when they come together, can annihilate each other and
liberate their entire mass in the form of energy, say $\gamma$-rays. The
positron is called an <em class="emph">antiparticle</em> to the electron, and these are
the characteristics of a particle and its antiparticle. It was clear
from Dirac’s argument that all the rest of the particles in the world
should also have corresponding antiparticles. For instance, for the
proton there should be an antiproton, which is now symbolized by
a $\overline{p}$. The $\overline{p}$ would have a negative electrical
charge and the same mass as a proton, and so on. The most important
feature, however, is that a proton and an antiproton coming together can
annihilate each other. The reason we emphasize this is that people do
not understand it when we say there is a neutron and also an
antineutron, because they say, “A neutron is neutral, so how <em class="emph">can</em>
it have the opposite charge?” The rule of the “anti” is not just that
it has the opposite charge, it has a certain set of properties, the
whole lot of which are opposite. The antineutron is distinguished from
the neutron in this way: if we bring two neutrons together, they just
stay as two neutrons, but if we bring a neutron and an antineutron
together, they annihilate each other with a great explosion of energy
being liberated, with various $\pi$-mesons, $\gamma$-rays, and whatnot.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S8-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now if we have antineutrons, antiprotons, and antielectrons, we can make
antiatoms, in principle. They have not been made yet, but it is possible
in principle. For instance, a hydrogen atom has a proton in the center
with an electron going around outside. Now imagine that somewhere we can
make an antiproton with a positron going around, would it go around?
Well, first of all, the antiproton is electrically negative and the
antielectron is electrically positive, so they attract each other in a
corresponding manner—the masses are all the same; everything is the
same. It is one of the principles of the symmetry of physics, the
equations seem to show, that if a clock, say, were made of matter on one
hand, and then we made the same clock of antimatter, it would run in
this way. (Of course, if we put the clocks together, they would
annihilate each other, but that is different.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S8-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">An immediate question then arises. We can build, out of matter, two
clocks, one which is “left-hand” and one which is “right-hand.” For
example, we could build a clock which is not built in a simple way, but
has cobalt and magnets and electron detectors which detect the presence
of $\beta$-decay electrons and count them. Each time one is counted, the
second hand moves over. Then the mirror clock, receiving fewer
electrons, will not run at the same rate. So evidently we can make two
clocks such that the left-hand clock does not agree with the right-hand
one. Let us make, out of matter, a clock which we call the standard or
right-hand clock. Now let us make, also out of matter, a clock which we
call the left-hand clock. We have just discovered that, in general,
these two will <em class="emph">not</em> run the same way; prior to that famous
physical discovery, it was thought that they would. Now it was also
supposed that matter and antimatter were equivalent. That is, if we made
an antimatter clock, right-hand, the same shape, then it would run the
same as the right-hand matter clock, and if we made the same clock to
the left it would run the same. In other words, in the beginning it was
believed that <em class="emph">all four</em> of these clocks were the same; now of
course we know that the right-hand and left-hand matter are not the
same. Presumably, therefore, the right-handed antimatter and the
left-handed antimatter are not the same.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S8-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">So the obvious question is, which goes with which, if either? In other
words, does the right-handed matter behave the same way as the
right-handed antimatter? Or does the right-handed matter behave the same
as the left-handed antimatter? $\beta$-decay experiments, using positron
decay instead of electron decay, indicate that this is the
interconnection: matter to the “right” works the same way as
antimatter to the “left.”</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S8-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Therefore, at long last, it is really true that right and left symmetry
is still maintained! If we made a left-hand clock, but made it out of
the other kind of matter, antimatter instead of matter, it would run in
the same way. So what has happened is that instead of having two
independent rules in our list of symmetries, two of these rules go
together to make a new rule, which says that matter to the right is
symmetrical with antimatter to the left.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S8-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">So if our Martian is made of antimatter and we give him instructions to
make this “right” handed model like us, it will, of course, come out
the other way around. What would happen when, after much conversation
back and forth, we each have taught the other to make space ships and we
meet halfway in empty space? We have instructed each other on our
traditions, and so forth, and the two of us come rushing out to shake
hands. Well, if he puts out his left hand, watch out!</p>

<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">52–9</span>Broken symmetries</h3>
<div id="Ch52-S9-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">The next question is, what can we make out of laws which are
<em class="emph">nearly</em> symmetrical? The marvelous thing about it all is that for
such a wide range of important, strong phenomena—nuclear forces,
electrical phenomena, and even weak ones like gravitation—over a
tremendous range of physics, all the laws for these seem to be
symmetrical. On the other hand, this little extra piece says, “No, the
laws are not symmetrical!” How is it that nature can be almost
symmetrical, but not perfectly symmetrical? What shall we make of this?
First, do we have any other examples? The answer is, we do, in fact,
have a few other examples. For instance, the nuclear part of the force
between proton and proton, between neutron and neutron, and between
neutron and proton, is all exactly the same—there is a symmetry for
nuclear forces, a new one, that we can interchange neutron and
proton—but it evidently is not a general symmetry, for the electrical
repulsion between two protons at a distance does not exist for neutrons.
So it is not generally true that we can <em class="emph">always</em> replace a proton
with a neutron, but only to a good approximation. Why <em class="emph">good?</em>
Because the nuclear forces are much stronger than the electrical forces.
So this is an “almost” symmetry also. So we do have examples in other
things.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S9-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We have, in our minds, a tendency to accept symmetry as some kind of
perfection. In fact it is like the old idea of the Greeks that circles
were perfect, and it was rather horrible to believe that the planetary
orbits were not circles, but only nearly circles. The difference between
being a circle and being nearly a circle is not a small difference, it
is a fundamental change so far as the mind is concerned. There is a sign
of perfection and symmetry in a circle that is not there the moment the
circle is slightly off—that is the end of it—it is no longer
symmetrical. Then the question is why it is only <em class="emph">nearly</em> a
circle—that is a much more difficult question. The actual motion of
the planets, in general, should be ellipses, but during the ages,
because of tidal forces, and so on, they have been made almost
symmetrical. Now the question is whether we have a similar problem here.
The problem from the point of view of the circles is if they were
perfect circles there would be nothing to explain, that is clearly
simple. But since they are only nearly circles, there is a lot to
explain, and the result turned out to be a big dynamical problem, and
now our problem is to explain why they are nearly symmetrical by looking
at tidal forces and so on.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch52-S9-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">So our problem is to explain where symmetry comes from. Why is nature so
nearly symmetrical? No one has any idea why. The only thing we might
suggest is something like this: There is a gate in Japan, a gate in
Neiko, which is sometimes called by the Japanese the most beautiful gate
in all Japan; it was built in a time when there was great influence from
Chinese art. This gate is very elaborate, with lots of gables and
beautiful carving and lots of columns and dragon heads and princes
carved into the pillars, and so on. But when one looks closely he sees
that in the elaborate and complex design along one of the pillars, one
of the small design elements is carved upside down; otherwise the thing
is completely symmetrical. If one asks why this is, the story is that it
was carved upside down so that the gods will not be jealous of the
