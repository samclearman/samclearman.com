<p class="p">The physicist needs a facility in looking at problems from several
points of view. The exact analysis of real physical problems is
usually quite complicated, and any particular physical situation may
be too complicated to analyze directly by solving the differential
equation. But one can still get a very good idea of the behavior of a
system if one has some feel for the character of the solution in
different circumstances. Ideas such as the field lines, capacitance,
resistance, and inductance are, for such purposes, very useful. So we
will spend much of our time analyzing them. In this way we will get a
feel as to what should happen in different electromagnetic
situations. On the other hand, none of the heuristic models, such as
field lines, is really adequate and accurate for all situations. There
is only one precise way of presenting the laws, and that is by means
of differential equations. They have the advantage of being
fundamental and, so far as we know, precise. If you have learned the
differential equations you can always go back to them. There is
nothing to unlearn.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch2-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">It will take you some time to understand what should happen in
different circumstances. You will have to solve the equations. Each
time you solve the equations, you will learn something about the
character of the solutions. To keep these solutions in mind, it will
be useful also to study their meaning in terms of field lines and of
other concepts. This is the way you will really “understand” the
equations. That is the difference between mathematics and
physics. Mathematicians, or people who have very mathematical minds,
are often led astray when “studying” physics because they lose sight
of the physics. They say: “Look, these differential equations—the
Maxwell equations—are all there is to electrodynamics; it is admitted by the
physicists that there is nothing which is not contained in the
equations. The equations are complicated, but after all they are only
mathematical equations and if I understand them mathematically inside
out, I will understand the physics inside out.” Only it doesn’t work
that way. Mathematicians who study physics with that point of view—and
there have been many of them—usually make little contribution to
physics and, in fact, little to mathematics. They fail because the
actual physical situations in the real world are so complicated that it
is necessary to have a much broader understanding of the equations.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch2-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">What it means really to understand an equation—that is, in more than
a strictly mathematical sense—was described by
Dirac. He said: “I
understand what an equation means if I have a way of figuring out the
characteristics of its solution without actually solving it.” So if
we have a way of knowing what should happen in given circumstances
without actually solving the equations, then we “understand” the
equations, as applied to these circumstances. A physical understanding
is a completely unmathematical, imprecise, and inexact thing, but
absolutely necessary for a physicist.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch2-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Ordinarily, a course like this is given by developing gradually the
physical ideas—by starting with simple situations and going on to
more and more complicated situations. This requires that you
continuously forget things you previously learned—things that are
true in certain situations, but which are not true in general. For
example, the “law” that the electrical force depends on the square
of the distance is not <em class="emph">always</em> true. We prefer the opposite
approach. We prefer to take first the <em class="emph">complete</em> laws, and then
to step back and apply them to simple situations, developing the
physical ideas as we go along. And that is what we are going to do.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch2-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Our approach is completely opposite to the historical approach in
which one develops the subject in terms of the experiments by which
the information was obtained. But the subject of physics has been
developed over the past 200&nbsp;years by some very ingenious people, and
as we have only a limited time to acquire our knowledge, we cannot
possibly cover everything they did. Unfortunately one of the things
that we shall have a tendency to lose in these lectures is the
historical, experimental development. It is hoped that in the
laboratory some of this lack can be corrected. You can also fill in
what we must leave out by reading the Encyclopedia Britannica, which
has excellent historical articles on electricity and on other parts of
physics. You will also find historical information in many textbooks
on electricity and magnetism.

<p class="p">We begin now with the abstract, mathematical view of the theory of
electricity and magnetism. The ultimate idea is to explain the meaning
of the laws given in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="II_01.html">1</a>. But to do this we must
first explain a new and peculiar notation that we want to use. So let
us forget electromagnetism for the moment and discuss the mathematics
of vector fields. It is of very great importance, not only for
electromagnetism, but for all kinds of physical circumstances. Just as
ordinary differential and integral calculus is so important to all
branches of physics, so also is the differential calculus of
vectors. We turn to that subject.

<p class="p">The simplest possible physical field is a scalar field. By a field,
you remember, we mean a quantity which depends upon position in
space. By a <em class="emph">scalar field</em> we merely mean a field which is
characterized at each point by a single number—a scalar. Of course
the number may change in time, but we need not worry about that for
the moment. We will talk about what the field looks like at a given
instant. As an example of a scalar field, consider a solid block of
material which has been heated at some places and cooled at others, so
that the temperature of the body varies from point to point in a
complicated way. Then the temperature will be a function of $x$,&nbsp;$y$,
and&nbsp;$z$, the position in space measured in a rectangular coordinate
system. Temperature is a scalar field.

Temperature&nbsp;$T$ is an example of a scalar field. With each
point&nbsp;$(x,y,z)$ in space there is associated a number&nbsp;$T(x,y,z)$. All
points on the surface marked&nbsp;$T=20^\circ$ (shown as a curve at&nbsp;$z=0$)
are at the same temperature. The arrows are samples of the heat flow
vector&nbsp;$\Figh$.
</div>
</div>

<div id="Ch2-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">One way of thinking about scalar fields is to imagine “contours” which
are imaginary surfaces drawn through all points for which the field has
the same value, just as contour lines on a map connect points with the
same height. For a temperature field the contours are called
“isothermal surfaces” or
isotherms. Figure&nbsp;<a href="#Ch2-F1">2–1</a> illustrates a
temperature field and shows the dependence of $T$ on $x$ and $y$ when
$z=0$. Several isotherms are drawn.

The velocity of the atoms in a rotating object is an example
of a vector field.

</div>

<div id="Ch2-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">There are also vector fields. The idea is very simple. A vector is
given for each point in space. The vector varies from point to
point. As an example, consider a rotating body. The velocity of the
material of the body at any point is a vector which is a function of
position (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch2-F2">2–2</a>). As a second example, consider the
flow of heat in a block of material. If the temperature in the block
is high at one place and low at another, there will be a flow of heat
from the hotter places to the colder. The heat will be flowing in
different directions in different parts of the block. The heat flow is
a directional quantity which we call&nbsp;$\FLPh$. Its magnitude is a
measure of how much heat is flowing. Examples of the heat flow vector
are also shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch2-F1">2–1</a>.

</div>

<div id="Ch2-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s make a more precise definition of&nbsp;$\FLPh$: The magnitude of the
vector heat flow at a point is the amount of thermal energy that
passes, per unit time and per unit area, through an infinitesimal
surface element at right angles to the direction of flow. The vector
points in the direction of flow (see Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch2-F3">2–3</a>). In
symbols: If&nbsp;$\Delta J$ is the thermal energy that passes per unit time
through the surface element&nbsp;$\Delta a$, then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:2:9}
\FLPh=\frac{\Delta J}{\Delta a}\,\FLPe_f,

<div id="Ch2-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">The vector&nbsp;$\FLPh$ can be defined in another way—in terms of its
components. We ask how much heat flows through a small surface at
<em class="emph">any</em> angle with respect to the flow. In Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch2-F4">2–4</a>
we show a small surface&nbsp;$\Delta a_2$ inclined with respect to&nbsp;$\Delta
a_1$, which is perpendicular to the flow. The <em class="emph">unit vector</em>&nbsp;$\FLPn$

is normal to the surface&nbsp;$\Delta a_2$. The angle&nbsp;$\theta$ between
$\FLPn$ and&nbsp;$\FLPh$ is the same as the angle between the surfaces
(since&nbsp;$\FLPh$ is normal to&nbsp;$\Delta a_1$). Now what is the heat flow <em class="emph">per
unit area</em> through&nbsp;$\Delta a_2$? The flow through&nbsp;$\Delta a_2$ is the
same as through&nbsp;$\Delta a_1$; only the areas are different. In
fact,&nbsp;$\Delta a_1=\Delta a_2\cos\theta$. The heat flow through&nbsp;$\Delta a_2$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:2:10}
\frac{\Delta J}{\Delta a_2}=\frac{\Delta J}{\Delta a_1}\cos\theta=
\FLPh\cdot\FLPn.
\end{equation}
We interpret this equation: the heat flow (per unit time and per unit
area) through <em class="emph">any</em> surface element whose unit normal is&nbsp;$\FLPn$,
is given by&nbsp;$\FLPh\cdot\FLPn$. Equally, we could say: the component of
the heat flow perpendicular to the surface element&nbsp;$\Delta a_2$
is&nbsp;$\FLPh\cdot\FLPn$. We can, if we wish, consider that these statements
<em class="emph">define</em>&nbsp;$\FLPh$. We will be applying the same ideas to other
vector fields.

<p class="p">When fields vary in time, we can describe the variation by giving
their derivatives with respect to&nbsp;$t$. We want to describe the
variations with position in a similar way, because we are interested
in the relationship between, say, the temperature in one place and the

temperature with respect to position? Do we differentiate the
temperature with respect to&nbsp;$x$? Or with respect to&nbsp;$y$, or&nbsp;$z$?

<p class="p">Useful physical laws do not depend upon the orientation of the
coordinate system. They should, therefore, be written in a form in

or a vector, or what? It is neither a scalar nor a vector, as you can
easily appreciate, because if we took a different $x$-axis,&nbsp;$\ddpl{T}{x}$
would certainly be different. But notice: We have three
possible derivatives: $\ddpl{T}{x}$,&nbsp;$\ddpl{T}{y}$, and&nbsp;$\ddpl{T}{z}$.
Since there are three kinds of derivatives and we know

by a rotation of the coordinate system. We shall show
that&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII211">2.11</a>) is indeed a vector. The derivatives do transform
in the correct way when the coordinate system is rotated.

<div id="Ch2-S3-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We can see this in several ways. One way is to ask a question whose

<div id="Ch2-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we can do something that is extremely amusing and ingenious—and
characteristic of the things that make mathematics beautiful. The
argument that $\grad T$, or&nbsp;$\FLPgrad{T}$, is a vector did not depend
upon <em class="emph">what</em> scalar field we were differentiating. All the
arguments would go the same if&nbsp;$T$ were replaced by <em class="emph">any scalar
field</em>. Since the transformation equations are the same no matter what
we differentiate, we could just as well omit the&nbsp;$T$ and replace
Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII226">2.26</a>) by the operator equation
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:2:27}
\ddp{}{x}=\ddp{}{x'}\cos\theta-\ddp{}{y'}\sin\theta.
\end{equation}
We leave the operators, as Jeans
said, “hungry for something to differentiate.”

<div id="Ch2-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Since the differential operators themselves transform as the components
of a vector should, we can call them components of a <em class="emph">vector

write
\begin{equation}

\FLPnabla=\biggl(\ddp{}{x},\ddp{}{y},\ddp{}{z}\biggr),
\end{equation}
which means, of course,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:2:29}
\nabla_x=\ddp{}{x},\quad\nabla_y=\ddp{}{y},\quad\nabla_z=\ddp{}{z}.
\end{equation}
We have abstracted the gradient away from the&nbsp;$T$—that is the
wonderful idea.

<div id="Ch2-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">You must always remember, of course, that&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$ is an
operator. Alone, it means nothing. If&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$ by itself means
nothing, what does it mean if we multiply <em class="emph">it</em> by a scalar—say&nbsp;$T$—to
get the product&nbsp;$T\FLPnabla$? (One can always multiply a
vector by a scalar.) It still does not mean anything. Its
$x$-component is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:2:30}
T\ddp{}{x},
\end{equation}
which is not a number, but is still some kind of operator. However,
according to the algebra of vectors we would still call&nbsp;$T\FLPnabla$ a
vector.

<div id="Ch2-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let’s multiply&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$ by a scalar on the other side, so that
we have the product&nbsp;$(\FLPgrad{T})$. In ordinary algebra
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:2:31}
T\FLPA=\FLPA T,
\end{equation}
but we have to remember that operator algebra is a little different
from ordinary vector algebra.
With operators we must always keep the
sequence right, so that the operations make proper sense. You will
have no difficulty if you just remember that the operator&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$
obeys the same convention as the derivative notation. What is to be
differentiated must be placed on the right of the&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$. The
order is important.

<div id="Ch2-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Keeping in mind this problem of order, we understand that&nbsp;$T\FLPnabla$
is an operator, but the product&nbsp;$\FLPgrad{T}$ is no longer a hungry
operator; the operator is completely satisfied. It is indeed a
physical vector having a meaning. It represents the spatial rate of
change of&nbsp;$T$. The $x$-component of&nbsp;$\FLPgrad{T}$ is how fast&nbsp;$T$
changes in the $x$-direction. What is the direction of the
vector&nbsp;$\FLPgrad{T}$? We know that the rate of change of&nbsp;$T$ in any direction
is the component of&nbsp;$\FLPgrad{T}$ in that direction (see
Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII215">2.15</a>)). It follows that the direction of&nbsp;$\FLPgrad{T}$ is
that in which it has the largest possible component—in other words,
the direction in which&nbsp;$T$ changes the fastest. The gradient of&nbsp;$T$ has
the direction of the steepest uphill slope (in&nbsp;$T$).

<div id="Ch2-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Can we do any other algebra with the vector operator&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$? Let
us try combining it with a vector. We can combine two vectors by
making a dot product. We could make the products

\end{equation*}
The first one doesn’t mean anything yet, because it is still an
operator. What it might ultimately mean would depend on what it is
made to operate on. The second product is some scalar
field. ($\FLPA\cdot\FLPB$ is always a scalar.)

<div id="Ch2-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s try the dot product of&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$ with a vector field we know,

\begin{equation}

Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII233">2.33</a>), even though it looks different. That is,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:2:35}
\FLPnabla'\cdot\FLPh=\FLPdiv{\FLPh}

for every point in space. So&nbsp;$\FLPdiv{\FLPh}$ is a scalar field, which
must represent some physical quantity. You should realize that the
combination of derivatives in&nbsp;$\FLPdiv{\FLPh}$ is rather
special. There are all sorts of other combinations like&nbsp;$\ddpl{h_y}{x}$,
which are neither scalars nor components of vectors.

<span class="tag">2–6</span>The differential equation of heat flow</h3>

<div id="Ch2-S6-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Let us give another example of a law of physics written in vector
notation. The law is not a precise one, but for many metals and a
number of other substances that conduct heat it is quite accurate. You
know that if you take a slab of material and heat one face to
temperature&nbsp;$T_2$ and cool the other to a different temperature&nbsp;$T_1$
the heat will flow through the material from $T_2$ to&nbsp;$T_1$
[Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch2-F7">2–7</a>(a)]. The heat flow is proportional to the
area&nbsp;$A$ of the faces, and to the temperature difference. It is also
inversely proportional to&nbsp;$d$, the distance between the plates. (For a
given temperature difference, the thinner the slab the greater the heat
flow.) Letting&nbsp;$J$ be the thermal energy that passes per unit time
through the slab, we write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:2:42}
J=\kappa(T_2-T_1)\,\frac{A}{d}.

<p class="p">What will happen in a more complicated case? Say in an odd-shaped
block of material in which the temperature varies in peculiar ways?
Suppose we look at a tiny piece of the block and imagine a slab like
that of Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch2-F7">2–7</a>(a) on a miniature scale. We orient the
faces parallel to the isothermal surfaces, as in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch2-F7">2–7</a>(b), so that Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII242">2.42</a>) is correct
for the small slab.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch2-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">If the area of the small slab is&nbsp;$\Delta A$, the heat flow per unit
time is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:2:43}
\Delta J=\kappa\,\Delta T\,\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta s},
\end{equation}
where&nbsp;$\Delta s$ is the thickness of the slab. Now&nbsp;$\Delta J/\Delta A$
we have defined earlier as the magnitude of&nbsp;$\FLPh$, whose direction
is the heat flow. The heat flow will be from $T_1+\Delta T$
toward&nbsp;$T_1$ and so it will be perpendicular to the isotherms, as drawn in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch2-F7">2–7</a>(b). Also,&nbsp;$\Delta T/\Delta s$ is just the rate
of change of&nbsp;$T$ with position. And since the position change is
perpendicular to the isotherms, our&nbsp;$\Delta T/\Delta s$ is the maximum
rate of change. It is, therefore, just the magnitude of&nbsp;$\FLPgrad{T}$.
Now since the direction of&nbsp;$\FLPgrad{T}$ is opposite to
that of&nbsp;$\FLPh$, we can write&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII243">2.43</a>) as a vector equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:2:44}
\FLPh=-\kappa\,\FLPgrad{T}.
\end{equation}
(The minus sign is necessary because heat flows “downhill” in
temperature.) Equation&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII244">2.44</a>) is the differential equation
of heat conduction in bulk materials. You see that it is a proper
vector equation. Each side is a vector if&nbsp;$\kappa$ is just a
number. It is the generalization to arbitrary cases of the special
relation&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII242">2.42</a>) for rectangular slabs. Later we should
learn to write all sorts of elementary physics relations
like&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII242">2.42</a>) in the more sophisticated vector notation. This
notation is useful not only because it makes the equations <em class="emph">look</em>
simpler. It also shows most clearly the <em class="emph">physical content</em> of the
equations without reference to any arbitrarily chosen coordinate system.

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:2:46}
\curl(\grad T)=\FLPcurl{(\FLPgrad{T})}=\FLPzero.

We can see how this equation comes about if we go through once with

\nabla_x(\FLPgrad{T})_y-\nabla_y(\FLPgrad{T})_x\notag\\[1ex]

other components. So $\FLPcurl{(\FLPgrad{T})}=\FLPzero$, for any
temperature distribution—in fact, for <em class="emph">any</em> scalar function.

<div id="Ch2-S7-p3" class="para">

<span class="tag">2–8</span>Pitfalls</h3>

<div id="Ch2-S8-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We have been applying our knowledge of ordinary
vector algebra to the
algebra of the operator&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$. We have to be careful, though,
because it is possible to go astray. There are two pitfalls which we
will mention, although they will not come up in this course. What
would you say about the following expression, that involves the two
scalar functions $\psi$ and&nbsp;$\phi$ (phi):
\begin{equation*}
(\FLPgrad{\psi})\times(\FLPgrad{\phi})?
\end{equation*}
You might want to say: it must be zero because it’s just like
\begin{equation*}
(\FLPA a)\times(\FLPA b),
\end{equation*}
which is zero because the cross product of two <em class="emph">equal</em>
vectors&nbsp;$\FLPA\times\FLPA$ is always zero. But in our example the two
operators&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$ are not equal! The first one operates on one
function,&nbsp;$\psi$; the other operates on a different function,&nbsp;$\phi$.
So although we represent them by the same symbol&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$,
they must be considered as different operators. Clearly, the direction
of&nbsp;$\FLPgrad{\psi}$ depends on the function&nbsp;$\psi$, so it is not
likely to be parallel to&nbsp;$\FLPgrad{\phi}$:
\begin{equation*}
(\FLPgrad{\psi})\times(\FLPgrad{\phi})\neq0\quad(\text{generally}).
\end{equation*}
Fortunately, we won’t have to use such expressions. (What we have said
doesn’t change the fact that $\FLPcurl{\FLPgrad{\psi}}=\FLPzero$ for
any scalar field, because here both&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$’s operate on the same
function.)

<div id="Ch2-S8-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Pitfall number two (which, again, we need not get into in our course)
is the following: The rules that we have outlined here are simple and
nice when we use rectangular coordinates. For example, if we
have&nbsp;$\nabla^2\FLPh$ and we want the $x$-component, it is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:2:60}
(\nabla^2\FLPh)_x=\biggl(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial
x^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial
z^2}\biggr)h_x=\nabla^2h_x.
\end{equation}
The same expression would <em class="emph">not</em> work if we were to ask for the
<em class="emph">radial</em> component of&nbsp;$\nabla^2\FLPh$. The radial component
of&nbsp;$\nabla^2\FLPh$ is not equal to&nbsp;$\nabla^2h_r$. The reason is that when
we are dealing with the algebra of
vectors,
the directions of the
vectors are all quite definite. But when we are dealing with vector
fields, their directions are different at different places. If we try
to describe a vector field in, say, polar coordinates, what we call
the “radial” direction varies from point to point. So we can get
into a lot of trouble when we start to differentiate the
components. For example, even for a <em class="emph">constant</em> vector field, the
radial component changes from point to point.

<div id="Ch2-S8-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">It is usually safest and simplest just to stick to rectangular
coordinates and avoid trouble, but there is one exception worth
mentioning: Since the Laplacian&nbsp;$\nabla^2$, is a scalar, we can write
it in any coordinate system we want to (for example, in polar
coordinates). But since it is a differential operator, we should use
it only on vectors whose components are in a fixed direction—that
means rectangular coordinates. So we shall express all of our vector
fields in terms of their $x$-,&nbsp;$y$-, and $z$-components when we write
our vector differential equations out in components.

		In our

		$a$,&nbsp;$b$, and&nbsp;$c$. If you like to use the unit vectors $\FLPi$,&nbsp;$\FLPj$,
		and&nbsp;$\FLPk$, you may write
		\begin{equation*}
		\FLPgrad{T}=\FLPi\ddp{T}{x}+\FLPj\ddp{T}{y}+\FLPk\ddp{T}{z}.

		We think of&nbsp;$\FLPh$ as a <em class="emph">physical</em> quantity that
		depends on position in space, and not strictly as a mathematical
		function of three variables. When&nbsp;$\FLPh$ is “differentiated” with
		respect to $x$,&nbsp;$y$, and&nbsp;$z$, or with respect to $x'$,&nbsp;$y'$, and&nbsp;$z'$,
		the mathematical expression for&nbsp;$\FLPh$ must first be expressed as a
		function of the appropriate variables.
