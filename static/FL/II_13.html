<p class="p">The force on an electric charge depends not only on where it
is, but also on how fast it is moving. Every point in space is
characterized by two vector quantities which determine the force on any
charge. First, there is the <em class="emph">electric force</em>, which gives a force component
independent of the motion of the charge. We describe it by the electric
field, $\FLPE$. Second, there is an additional force component, called
the <em class="emph">magnetic force</em>, which depends on the velocity of the charge. This magnetic
force has a strange directional character: At any particular point in
space, both the <em class="emph">direction</em> of the force and its <em class="emph">magnitude</em>
depend on the direction of motion of the particle: at every instant the
force is always at right angles to the velocity vector; also, at any
particular point, the force is always at right angles to a <em class="emph">fixed
direction in space</em> (see Fig. <a href="#Ch13-F1">13–1</a>); and finally, the
magnitude of the force is proportional to the <em class="emph">component</em> of the
velocity at right angles to this unique direction. It is possible to
describe all of this behavior by defining the magnetic field
vector $\FLPB$, which specifies both the unique direction in space and
the constant of proportionality with the velocity, and to write the
magnetic force as $q\FLPv\times\FLPB$. The total electromagnetic force
on a charge can, then, be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:13:1}
\FLPF=q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB).

carrying electric currents. In order to do this, we define what is meant
by the current density. Electric currents are electrons or other charges
in motion with a net drift or flow. We can represent the charge flow by
a vector which gives the amount of charge passing per unit area and per
unit time through a surface element at right angles to the flow (just as
we did for the case of heat flow). We call this the <em class="emph">current
density</em> and
represent it by the vector $\FLPj$. It is directed along the motion of
the charges. If we take a small area $\Delta S$ at a given place in the

the charge contained in a parallelepiped whose base is $\Delta S$ and
whose height is $v\,\Delta t$, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch13-F2">13–2</a>. The
volume of the parallelepiped is the projection of $\Delta S$ at right

<p class="p">Now we are ready to find the force on a current-carrying wire in a
magnetic field. The current consists of charged particles moving with
the velocity $\FLPv$ along the wire. Each charge feels a transverse
force
\begin{equation*}
\FLPF=q\FLPv\times\FLPB

(Fig. <a href="#Ch13-F5">13–5</a>a). If there are $N$ such charges per unit

<div id="Ch13-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We have seen that there is a force on a wire in the presence of a
magnetic field, produced, say, by a magnet. From the principle that
action equals reaction we might expect that there should be a force on
the source of the magnetic field, i.e., on the magnet, when there is a
current through the wire.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> There are indeed such forces, as is seen by the deflection of a
compass needle near a current-carrying wire. Now we know that magnets
feel forces from other magnets, so that means that when there is a
current in a wire, the wire itself generates a magnetic field. Moving
charges, then, <em class="emph">produce</em> a magnetic field. We would like now to try
to discover the laws that determine how such magnetic fields are
created. The question is: Given a current, what magnetic field does it
make? The answer to this question was determined experimentally by three
critical experiments and a brilliant theoretical argument given by
Amp&egrave;re. We will pass
over this interesting historical development and simply say that a large
number of experiments have demonstrated the validity of
Maxwell’s equations. We take
them as our starting point. If we drop the terms involving time
derivatives in these equations we get the equations of
<em class="emph">magnetostatics</em>:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:13:12}
\FLPdiv{\FLPB}=0
\end{equation}

and
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:13:13}
c^2\FLPcurl{\FLPB}=\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO}.
\end{equation}

These equations are valid only if all electric charge densities are
constant and all currents are steady, so that the electric and
magnetic fields are not changing with time—all of the fields are
“static.”</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We may remark that it is rather dangerous to think that there is such
a thing as a static magnetic situation, because there must be currents
in order to get a magnetic field at all—and currents can come only
from moving charges. “Magnetostatics” is, therefore, an
approximation. It refers to a special kind of dynamic situation with
<em class="emph">large numbers</em> of charges in motion, which we can approximate by
a <em class="emph">steady</em> flow of charge. Only then can we speak of a current
density $\FLPj$ which does not change with time. The subject should
more accurately be called the study of steady currents. Assuming that
all fields are steady, we drop all terms in $\ddpl{\FLPE}{t}$
and $\ddpl{\FLPB}{t}$ from the complete Maxwell
equations,
Eqs. (<a href="II_02.html#mjx-eqn-EqII241">2.41</a>), and obtain the two equations
(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1312">13.12</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1313">13.13</a>) above. Also notice that
since the divergence of the curl of any vector is necessarily zero,
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1313">13.13</a>) requires that $\FLPdiv{\FLPj}=0$. This is true,
by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII138">13.8</a>), only if $\ddpl{\rho}{t}$ is zero. But that
must be so if $\FLPE$ is not changing with time, so our assumptions are
consistent.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The requirement that $\FLPdiv{\FLPj}=0$ means that we may only have
charges which flow in paths that close back on themselves. They may,
for instance, flow in wires that form complete loops—called
circuits. The circuits may, of course, contain generators or batteries
that keep the charges flowing. But they may not include condensers
which are charging or discharging. (We will, of course, extend the
theory later to include dynamic fields, but we want first to take the
simpler case of steady currents.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let us look at Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1312">13.12</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1313">13.13</a>) to
see what they mean. The first one says that the divergence of $\FLPB$ is zero.
Comparing it to the analogous equation in electrostatics, which says
that $\FLPdiv{\FLPE}=-\rho/\epsO$, we can conclude that there is no magnetic
analog of an electric charge. There are <em class="emph">no magnetic charges</em> from which
lines of $\FLPB$ can emerge. If we think in terms of “lines” of the vector
field $\FLPB$, they can never start and they never stop. Then where do they come
from?  Magnetic fields “appear” <em class="emph">in the presence of</em> currents; they have
a <em class="emph">curl</em> proportional to the current density. Wherever there are currents,
there are lines of magnetic field making loops around the currents. Since lines
of $\FLPB$ do not begin or end, they will often close back on themselves, making
closed loops. But there can also be complicated situations in which the lines
are not simple closed loops. But whatever they do, they never diverge from
points. No magnetic charges have ever been discovered, so $\FLPdiv{\FLPB}=0$.
This much is true not only for magnetostatics, it is <em class="emph">always</em> true—even
for dynamic fields.</p>

<p class="p">The connection between the $\FLPB$ field and currents is contained in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1313">13.13</a>). Here we have a new kind of situation which
is quite different from electrostatics, where we
had $\FLPcurl{\FLPE}=\FLPzero$. That equation meant that the line integral
of $\FLPE$ around any closed path is zero:
\begin{equation*}
\underset{\text{loop}}{\oint}\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs=0.
\end{equation*}

We got that result from Stokes’ theorem, which says that the integral
around any closed path of <em class="emph">any</em> vector field is equal to the
surface integral of the normal component of the curl of the vector
(taken over any surface which has the closed loop as its
periphery). Applying the same theorem to the magnetic field vector and
using the symbols shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch13-F6">13–6</a>, we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:13:14}
\oint_\Gamma\FLPB\cdot d\FLPs=
\int_S(\FLPcurl{\FLPB})\cdot\FLPn\,dS.
\end{equation}

Taking the curl of $\FLPB$ from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1313">13.13</a>), we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:13:15}
\oint_\Gamma\FLPB\cdot d\FLPs=
\frac{1}{\epsO c^2}
\int_S\FLPj\cdot\FLPn\,dS.
\end{equation}

The integral over $S$, according to (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII135">13.5</a>), is the total
current $I$ through the surface $S$. Since for steady currents the
current through $S$ is independent of the shape of $S$, so long as it
is bounded by the curve $\Gamma$, one usually speaks of “the current
through the loop $\Gamma$.” We have, then, a general law: the
circulation of $\FLPB$ around any closed curve is equal to the
current $I$ through the loop, divided by $\epsO c^2$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:13:16}
\oint_\Gamma\FLPB\cdot d\FLPs=
\frac{I_{\text{through $\Gamma$}}}{\epsO c^2}.
\end{equation}

This law—called <em class="emph">Amp&egrave;re’s law</em>—plays the same role in
magnetostatics that Gauss’ law played in electrostatics. Amp&egrave;re’s law
alone does not determine $\FLPB$ from currents; we must, in general,
also use $\FLPdiv{\FLPB}=0$. But, as we will see in the next section, it
can be used to find the field in special circumstances which have
certain simple symmetries.</p>

<p class="p">We can illustrate the use of Amp&egrave;re’s law by finding the magnetic field
near a wire. We ask: What is the field outside a long straight wire with
a cylindrical cross section? We will assume something which may not be
at all evident, but which is nevertheless true: that the field lines
of $\FLPB$ go around the wire in closed circles. If we make this
assumption, then Amp&egrave;re’s law, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1316">13.16</a>), tells us how
strong the field is. From the symmetry of the problem, $\FLPB$ has the
same magnitude at all points on a circle concentric with the wire (see
Fig. <a href="#Ch13-F7">13–7</a>). We can then do the line integral of $\FLPB\cdot
d\FLPs$ quite easily; it is just the magnitude of $\FLPB$ times the
circumference. If $r$ is the radius of the circle, then
\begin{equation*}
\oint\FLPB\cdot d\FLPs=B\cdot2\pi r.
\end{equation*}

The total current through the loop is merely the current $I$ in the
wire, so
\begin{equation}
B\cdot2\pi r=\frac{I}{\epsO c^2},\notag
\end{equation}

or
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:13:17}
B=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO c^2}\,\frac{2I}{r}.
\end{equation}

The strength of the magnetic field drops off inversely as $r$, the
distance from the axis of the wire. We can, if we wish, write
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1317">13.17</a>) in vector form. Remembering that $\FLPB$ is at
right angles both to $\FLPI$ and to $\FLPr$, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:13:18}
\FLPB=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO c^2}\,\frac{2\FLPI\times\FLPe_r}{r}.
\end{equation}

We have separated out the factor $1/4\pi\epsO c^2$, because it appears
often. It is worth remembering that it is exactly $10^{-7}$ (in the
mks system), since an equation like (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1317">13.17</a>) is used to
<em class="emph">define</em> the unit of current, the ampere. At one meter from a
current of one ampere the magnetic field is $2\times10^{-7}$ webers

angles to the $\FLPB$ field of the other; the wires should then be

<em class="emph">solenoid</em>. We observe experimentally that when a

That being the case, we can use Amp&egrave;re’s law with the rectangular
“curve” $\Gamma$ shown in the figure. This loop goes the distance $L$
inside the solenoid, where the field is, say, $\FLPB_0$, then goes at
right angles to the field, and returns along the outside, where the
field is negligible. The line integral of $\FLPB$ for this curve is
just $B_0L$, and it must be $1/\epsO c^2$ times the total current
through $\Gamma$, which is $NI$ if there are $N$ turns of the solenoid
in the length $L$. We have
\begin{equation*}
B_0L=\frac{NI}{\epsO c^2}.
\end{equation*}

Or, letting $n$ be the number of turns <em class="emph">per unit length</em> of the

Such a field is just what is observed outside of a bar magnet. But what

<p class="p">Matter is very complex when looked at from a fundamental point of
view—as we saw when we tried to understand dielectrics. In order not
to interrupt our present discussion, we will wait until later to deal
in detail with the interior mechanisms of magnetic materials like
iron: You will have to accept, for the moment, that all magnetism is
produced from currents, and that in a permanent magnet there are
permanent internal currents. In the case of iron, these currents come
from electrons spinning around their own axes. Every electron has such
a spin, which corresponds to a tiny circulating current. Of course,
one electron doesn’t produce much magnetic field, but in an ordinary
piece of matter there are billions and billions of electrons. Normally
these spin and point every which way, so that there is no net
effect. The miracle is that in a very few substances, like iron, a
large fraction of the electrons spin with their axes in the same
direction—for iron, two electrons of each atom take part in this
cooperative motion. In a bar magnet there are large numbers of
electrons all spinning in the same direction and, as we will see,
their total effect is equivalent to a current circulating on the
surface of the bar. (This is quite analogous to what we found for
dielectrics—that a uniformly polarized dielectric is equivalent to a
distribution of charges on its surface.) It is, therefore, no accident
that a bar magnet is equivalent to a solenoid.</p>

<p class="p">When we said that the magnetic force on a charge was proportional to
its velocity, you may have wondered: “What velocity? With respect to
which reference frame?” It is, in fact, clear from the definition
of $\FLPB$ given at the beginning of this chapter that what this vector
is will depend on what we choose as a reference frame for our
specification of the velocity of charges. But we have said nothing
about which is the proper frame for specifying the magnetic field.</p>

<p class="p">It turns out that <em class="emph">any</em> inertial frame will do. We will also see
that magnetism and electricity are not independent things—that they
should always be taken together as <em class="emph">one</em> complete electromagnetic
field. Although in the static case Maxwell’s
equations separate into two distinct
pairs, one pair for electricity and one pair for magnetism, with no
apparent connection between the two fields, nevertheless, in nature
itself there is a very intimate relationship between them that arises
from the principle of relativity. Historically, the principle of
relativity was discovered after Maxwell’s
equations. It was, in fact, the study
of electricity and magnetism which led ultimately to
Einstein’s discovery of his
principle of relativity. But let’s see what our knowledge of relativity
would tell us about magnetic forces if we assume that the relativity
principle is applicable—as it is—to electromagnetism.

velocity is zero. Does it, therefore, stay where it is? Would we see
different things happening in the two systems? The principle of

closer to the wire. We must try to understand why that would happen.</p>

the electrons stay fixed in the body of the material. We let the
charge density of the conduction electrons be $\rho_-$ and their
velocity in $S$ be $\FLPv$. The density of the charges at rest in $S$
is $\rho_+$, which must be equal to the negative of $\rho_-$, since we are
considering an uncharged wire. There is thus no electric field outside
the wire, and the force on the moving particle is just

between $S$ and $S'$ (see Chapter <a href="I_15.html">15</a>, Vol. I), so
volumes will change also. Since the charge <em class="emph">densities</em> depend on
the volume occupied by charges, the densities will change, too.</p>

heated block the charge of the electrons and protons would no longer
balance. A block would become charged when heated. As we have seen
earlier, a very small fractional change in the charge of all the
electrons in a block would give rise to enormous electric fields. No
such effect has ever been observed.</p>

<div id="Ch13-S6-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">Also, we can point out that the mean speed of the electrons in matter
depends on its chemical composition. If the charge on an electron
changed with speed, the net charge in a piece of material would be
changed in a chemical reaction. Again, a straightforward calculation
shows that even a very small dependence of charge on speed would give
enormous fields from the simplest chemical reactions. No such effect
is observed, and we conclude that the electric charge of a single
particle is independent of its state of motion.</p>

Our moving wire is positively charged and will produce an electric
field $E'$ at the external stationary particle. We have already solved
the electrostatic problem of a uniformly charged cylinder. The
electric field at the distance $r$ from the axis of the cylinder is
\begin{equation}

<div id="Ch13-S6-p21" class="para">
<p class="p">One way of seeing this is to ask a question like: What transverse
momentum will the particle have after the force has acted for a little
while? We know from Chapter <a href="I_16.html">16</a> of Vol. I that the transverse
momentum of a particle should be the same in both the $S$- and
$S'$-frames. Calling the transverse coordinate $y$, we want to
compare $\Delta p_y$ and $\Delta p_y'$. Using the relativistically correct
equation of motion, $\FLPF=d\FLPp/dt$, we expect that after the
time $\Delta t$ our particle will have a transverse momentum $\Delta p_y$
in the $S$-system given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:13:31}
\Delta p_y=F\,\Delta t.

In the $S'$-system, the transverse momentum will be
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:13:32}
\Delta p_y'=F'\,\Delta t'.
\end{equation}

We must, of course, compare $\Delta p_y$ and $\Delta p_y'$ for
corresponding time intervals $\Delta t$ and $\Delta t'$. We have seen in
Chapter <a href="I_15.html">15</a> of Vol. I that the time intervals referred to a
<em class="emph">moving</em> particle appear to be <em class="emph">longer</em> than those in the rest

we expect, for small $\Delta t$, that
\begin{equation}

<span class="tag">13–8</span>Superposition; the right-hand rule</h3>
<div id="Ch13-S8-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We will conclude this chapter by making two further points regarding
the subject of magnetostatics. First, our basic equations for the
magnetic field,
\begin{equation*}
\FLPdiv{\FLPB}=0,\quad\FLPcurl{\FLPB}=\FLPj/c^2\epsO,
\end{equation*}

are linear in $\FLPB$ and $\FLPj$. That means that the principle of
superposition also applies to magnetic fields. The field produced by
two different steady currents is the sum of the individual fields from
each current acting alone. Our second remark concerns the right-hand
rules which we have encountered (such as the right-hand rule for the
magnetic field produced by a current). We have also observed that the
magnetization of an iron magnet is to be understood from the spin of
the electrons in the material. The direction of the magnetic field of
a spinning electron is related to its spin axis by the same right-hand
rule. Because $\FLPB$ is determined by a “handed” rule—involving
either a cross product or a curl—it is called an <em class="emph">axial</em>
vector. (Vectors whose direction in space does not depend on a
reference to a right or left hand are called <em class="emph">polar</em>
vectors. Displacement, velocity, force, and $\FLPE$, for example, are
polar vectors.)</p>

<div id="Ch13-S8-p2" class="para">
<p class="p"><em class="emph">Physically observable</em> quantities in electromagnetism are
<em class="emph">not</em>, however, right- (or left-) handed. Electromagnetic
interactions are symmetrical under reflection (see
Chapter <a href="I_52.html">52</a>, Vol. I). Whenever magnetic forces between two
sets of currents are computed, the result is invariant with respect to a
change in the hand convention. Our equations lead, independently of the
right-hand convention, to the end result that parallel currents attract,
or that currents in opposite directions repel. (Try working out the
force using “left-hand rules.”)  An attraction or repulsion is a polar
vector. This happens because in describing any complete interaction, we
use the right-hand rule twice—once to find $\FLPB$ from currents,
again to find the force this $\FLPB$ produces on a second current. Using
the right-hand rule twice is the same as using the left-hand rule twice.
If we were to change our conventions to a left-hand system all our
$\FLPB$ fields would be reversed, but all forces—or, what is perhaps
more relevant, the observed accelerations of objects—would be
unchanged.</p>

<p class="p">Although physicists have recently found to their surprise that
<em class="emph">all</em> the laws of nature are not always invariant for mirror
reflections, the laws of electromagnetism do have such a basic
symmetry.</p>

  We will see later, however, that such
assumptions are <em class="emph">not</em> generally correct for electromagnetic
forces!
