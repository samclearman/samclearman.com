                        <p class="p">In this chapter we shall discuss one of the most
                        far-reaching generalizations of the human mind. While we are admiring
                        the human mind, we should take some time off to stand in awe of a
                        <em class="emph">nature</em> that could follow with such completeness and generality
                        such an elegantly simple principle as the law of gravitation. What is
                        this law of gravitation? It is that every object in the universe
                        attracts every other object with a force which for any two bodies is
                        proportional to the mass of each and varies inversely as the square of
                        the distance between them. This statement can be expressed
                        mathematically by the equation
                        \begin{equation*}
                        F=G\,\frac{mm'}{r^2}.
                        \end{equation*}
                        If to this we add the fact that an object responds to a force by
                        accelerating in the direction of the force by an amount that is
                        inversely proportional to the mass of the object, we shall have said
                        everything required, for a sufficiently talented mathematician could
                        then deduce all the consequences of these two principles. However, since
                        you are not assumed to be sufficiently talented yet, we shall discuss
                        the consequences in more detail, and not just leave you with only these
                        two bare principles. We shall briefly relate the story of the discovery
                        of the law of gravitation and discuss some of its consequences, its
                        effects on history, the mysteries that such a law entails, and some
                        refinements of the law made by Einstein; we shall also discuss the
                        relationships of the law to the other laws of physics. All this cannot
                        be done in one chapter, but these subjects will be treated in due time
                        in subsequent chapters.</p>

                        <p class="p">The story begins with the ancients observing the motions of planets
                        among the stars, and finally deducing that they went around the sun, a
                        fact that was rediscovered later by Copernicus. Exactly <em class="emph">how</em> the planets went around the
                        sun, with exactly <em class="emph">what motion</em>, took a little more work to
                        discover. In the beginning of the fifteenth century there were great
                        debates as to whether they really went around the sun or not. Tycho
                        Brahe had an idea that was different
                        from anything proposed by the ancients: his idea was that these debates
                        about the nature of the motions of the planets would best be resolved if
                        the actual positions of the planets in the sky were measured
                        sufficiently accurately. If measurement showed exactly how the planets
                        moved, then perhaps it would be possible to establish one or another
                        viewpoint. This was a tremendous idea—that to find something out, it
                        is better to perform some careful experiments than to carry on deep
                        philosophical arguments. Pursuing this idea, Tycho Brahe studied the positions of the planets for many years
                        in his observatory on the island of Hven, near Copenhagen. He made
                        voluminous tables, which were then studied by the mathematician
                        Kepler, after
                        Tycho’s death.
                        Kepler discovered from the data
                        some very beautiful and remarkable, but simple, laws regarding planetary
                        motion.</p>

                        ellipse. An ellipse is not just an oval,

                        <p class="p">Kepler’s second observation was
                        that the planets do not go around the sun at a uniform speed, but move
                        faster when they are nearer the sun and more slowly when they are
                        farther from the sun, in precisely this way: Suppose a planet is
                        observed at any two successive times, let us say a week apart, and that
                        the radius vector<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> is drawn to the planet for each
                        observed position. The orbital arc traversed by the planet during the
                        week, and the two radius vectors, bound a certain plane area, the shaded
                        area shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F2">7–2</a>. If two similar observations are made
                        a week apart, at a part of the orbit farther from the sun (where the
                        planet moves more slowly), the similarly bounded area is exactly the
                        same as in the first case. So, in accordance with the second law, the
                        orbital speed of each planet is such that the radius “sweeps out”
                        equal areas in equal times.</p>

                        other two, because it deals not with only a single planet, but relates
                        one planet to another. This law says that when the orbital period and
                        orbit size of any two planets are compared, the periods are proportional
                        to the $3/2$ power of the orbit size. In this statement the period is
                        the time interval it takes a planet to go completely around its orbit,
                        and the size is measured by the length of the greatest diameter of the
                        elliptical orbit, technically known as the major axis. More simply, if
                        the planets went in circles, as they nearly do, the time required to go
                        around the circle would be proportional to the $3/2$ power of the
                        diameter (or radius). Thus Kepler’s three laws are:

                        <p class="p">While Kepler was discovering
                        these laws, Galileo was studying
                        the laws of motion. The problem was, what makes the planets go around?
                        (In those days, one of the theories proposed was that the planets went
                        around because behind them were invisible angels, beating their wings
                        and driving the planets forward. You will see that this theory is now
                        modified! It turns out that in order to keep the planets going around,
                        the invisible angels must fly in a different direction and they have no
                        wings. Otherwise, it is a somewhat similar theory!)
                        Galileo discovered a very
                        remarkable fact about motion, which was essential for understanding
                        these laws. That is the principle of <em class="emph">inertia</em>—if something is
                        moving, with nothing touching it and completely undisturbed, it will go
                        on forever, coasting at a uniform speed in a straight line. (<em class="emph">Why</em>
                        does it keep on coasting? We do not know, but that is the way it is.)</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="Ch7-S3-p2" class="para">
                        <p class="p">Newton modified this idea, saying
                        that the only way to change the motion of a body is to use <em class="emph">force</em>.
                        If the body speeds up, a force has been applied <em class="emph">in the direction
                            of motion</em>. On the other hand, if its motion is changed to a new
                        <em class="emph">direction</em>, a force has been applied <em class="emph">sideways</em>.
                        Newton thus added the idea that a
                        force is needed to change the speed <em class="emph">or the direction</em> of motion of
                        a body. For example, if a stone is attached to a string and is whirling
                        around in a circle, it takes a force to keep it in the circle. We have
                        to <em class="emph">pull</em> on the string. In fact, the law is that the acceleration
                        produced by the force is inversely proportional to the mass, or the
                        force is proportional to the mass times the acceleration. The more
                        massive a thing is, the stronger the force required to produce a given
                        acceleration. (The mass can be measured by putting other stones on the
                        end of the same string and making them go around the same circle at the
                        same speed. In this way it is found that more or less force is required,
                        the more massive object requiring more force.) The brilliant idea
                        resulting from these considerations is that no <em class="emph">tangential</em> force
                        is needed to keep a planet in its orbit (the angels do not have to fly
                        tangentially) because the planet would coast in that direction anyway.
                        If there were nothing at all to disturb it, the planet would go off in a
                        <em class="emph">straight line</em>. But the actual motion deviates from the line on
                        which the body would have gone if there were no force, the deviation
                        being essentially <em class="emph">at right angles</em> to the motion, not in the
                        direction of the motion. In other words, because of the principle of
                        inertia, the force needed to control the motion of a planet
                        <em class="emph">around</em> the sun is not a force around the sun but <em class="emph">toward</em>
                        the sun. (If there is a force toward the sun, the sun might be the
                        angel, of course!)</p>

                        <p class="p">The next problem was whether the pull of the earth on its people was the
                        “same” as its pull on the moon, i.e., inversely as the square of the
                        distance. If an object on the surface of the earth falls $16$ feet in
                        the first second after it is released from rest, how far does the moon
                        fall in the same time? We might say that the moon does not fall at all.
                        But if there were no force on the moon, it would go off in a straight
                        line, whereas it goes in a circle instead, so it really <em class="emph">falls in</em>
                        from where it would have been if there were no force at all. We can
                        calculate from the radius of the moon’s orbit (which is about
                        $240{,}000$ miles) and how long it takes to go around the earth
                        (approximately $29$ days), how far the moon moves in its orbit in
                        $1$ second, and can then calculate how far it falls in one
                        second.<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a> This distance turns out to be roughly $1/20$ of an
                        inch in a second. That fits very well with the inverse square law,
                        because the earth’s radius is $4000$ miles, and if something which is
                        $4000$ miles from the center of the earth falls $16$ feet in a second,
                        something $240{,}000$ miles, or $60$ times as far away, should fall
                        only $1/3600$ of $16$ feet, which also is roughly $1/20$ of an inch.
                        Wishing to put this theory of gravitation to a test by similar
                        calculations, Newton made his
                        calculations very carefully and found a discrepancy so large that he
                        regarded the theory as contradicted by facts, and did not publish his
                        results. Six years later a new measurement of the size of the earth
                        showed that the astronomers had been using an incorrect distance to the
                        moon. When Newton heard of this,
                        he made the calculation again, with the corrected figures, and obtained
                        beautiful agreement.</p>

                        <p class="p">This idea that the moon “falls” is somewhat confusing, because, as you
                        see, it does not come any <em class="emph">closer</em>. The idea is sufficiently
                        interesting to merit further explanation: the moon falls in the sense
                        that <em class="emph">it falls away from the straight line that it would pursue if
                            there were no forces</em>. Let us take an example on the surface of the
                        earth. An object released near the earth’s surface will fall $16$ feet
                        in the first second. An object shot out <em class="emph">horizontally</em> will also
                        fall $16$ feet; even though it is moving horizontally, it still falls
                        the same $16$ feet in the same time. Figure <a href="#Ch7-F3">7–3</a> shows an
                        apparatus which demonstrates this. On the horizontal track is a ball
                        which is going to be driven forward a little distance away. At the same
                        height is a ball which is going to fall vertically, and there is an
                        electrical switch arranged so that at the moment the first ball leaves
                        the track, the second ball is released. That they come to the same depth
                        at the same time is witnessed by the fact that they collide in midair.
                        An object like a bullet, shot horizontally, might go a long way in one
                        second—perhaps $2000$ feet—but it will still fall $16$ feet if it is
                        aimed horizontally. What happens if we shoot a bullet faster and faster?
                        Do not forget that the earth’s surface is curved. If we shoot it fast
                        enough, then when it falls $16$ feet it may be at just the same height
                        above the ground as it was before. How can that be? It still falls, but
                        the earth curves away, so it falls “around” the earth. The question
                        is, how far does it have to go in one second so that the earth is
                        $16$ feet below the horizon? In Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F4">7–4</a> we see the earth
                        with its $4000$-mile radius, and the tangential, straight line path that
                        the bullet would take if there were no force. Now, if we use one of
                        those wonderful theorems in geometry, which says that our tangent is the
                        mean proportional between the two parts of the diameter cut by an equal
                        chord, we see that the horizontal distance travelled is the mean
                        proportional between the $16$ feet fallen and the $8000$-mile diameter
                        of the earth. The square root of $(16/5280)\times8000$ comes out very
                        close to $5$ miles. Thus we see that if the bullet moves at $5$ miles a
                        second, it then will continue to fall toward the earth at the same rate
                        of $16$ feet each second, but will never get any closer because the
                        earth keeps curving away from it. Thus it was that Mr. Gagarin
                        maintained himself in space while going $25{,}000$ miles around the
                        earth at approximately $5$ miles per second. (He took a little longer
                        because he was a little higher.)</p>

                        understood. For example, the pull of the moon on the earth causes the
                        tides, hitherto mysterious. The moon pulls the water up under it and
                        makes the tides—people had thought of that before, but they were not
                        as clever as Newton, and so they
                        thought there ought to be only one tide during the day. The reasoning
                        was that the moon pulls the water up under it, making a high tide and a
                        low tide, and since the earth spins underneath, that makes the tide at
                        one station go up and down every $24$ hours. Actually the tide goes up
                        and down in $12$ hours. Another school of thought claimed that the high
                        tide should be on the other side of the earth because, so they argued,
                        the moon pulls the earth away from the water! Both of these theories are
                        wrong. It actually works like this: the pull of the moon for the earth
                        and for the water is “balanced” at the center. But the water which is
                        closer to the moon is pulled <em class="emph">more</em> than the average and the water
                        which is farther away from it is pulled <em class="emph">less</em> than the average.
                        Furthermore, the water can flow while the more rigid earth cannot. The
                        true picture is a combination of these two things.</p>

                        whole earth toward it, why doesn’t the earth fall right “up” to the
                        moon? Because the earth does the same trick as the moon, it goes in a
                        circle around a point which is inside the earth but not at its center.
                        The moon does not just go around the earth, the earth and the moon both
                        go around a central position, each falling toward this common position,
                        as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F5">7–5</a>. This motion around the common center
                        is what balances the fall of each. So the earth is not going in a
                        straight line either; it travels in a circle. The water on the far side
                        is “unbalanced” because the moon’s attraction there is weaker than it
                        is at the center of the earth, where it just balances the “centrifugal
                        force.” The
                        result of this imbalance is that the water rises up, away from the
                        center of the earth. On the near side, the attraction from the moon is
                        stronger, and the imbalance is in the opposite direction in space, but
                        again <em class="emph">away</em> from the center of the earth. The net result is that

                        gravitation. The earth can be understood to be round merely because
                        everything attracts everything else and so it has attracted itself
                        together as far as it can! If we go even further, the earth is not
                        <em class="emph">exactly</em> a sphere because it is rotating, and this brings in
                        centrifugal effects which tend to oppose gravity near the equator. It turns out that
                        the earth should be elliptical, and we even get the right shape for the
                        ellipse. We can thus deduce that the sun, the moon, and the earth should
                        be (nearly) spheres, just from the law of gravitation.

                        moons of Jupiter we can understand everything about the way they move
                        around that planet. Incidentally, there was once a certain difficulty
                        with the moons of Jupiter that is worth remarking on. These satellites
                        were studied very carefully by Rømer, who noticed that the moons sometimes seemed to be ahead
                        of schedule, and sometimes behind. (One can find their schedules by
                        waiting a very long time and finding out how long it takes on the
                        average for the moons to go around.) Now they were <em class="emph">ahead</em> when
                        Jupiter was particularly <em class="emph">close</em> to the earth and they were
                        <em class="emph">behind</em> when Jupiter was <em class="emph">farther</em> from the earth. This would
                        have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of
                        gravitation—it would have been, in fact, the death of this wonderful
                        theory if there were no other explanation. If a law does not work even
                        in <em class="emph">one place</em> where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason
                        for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little
                        while to <em class="emph">see</em> the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes
                        light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the
                        earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth,
                        the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a
                        little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to
                        or farther from the earth. This phenomenon showed that light does not
                        travel instantaneously, and furnished the first estimate of the speed of
                        light. This was done in 1676.</p>

                        around the correct elliptical orbit. Such a motion is a little more
                        complicated. Attempts were made to analyze the motions of Jupiter,

                        peculiar manner. It was not travelling in an exact ellipse, but that was
                        understandable, because of the attractions of Jupiter and Saturn. But
                        even if allowance were made for these attractions, Uranus <em class="emph">still</em>
                        was not going right, so the laws of gravitation were in danger of being
                        overturned, a possibility that could not be ruled out. Two men,
                        Adams and Le Verrier, in England and
                        France, independently, arrived at another possibility: perhaps there is
                        <em class="emph">another</em> planet, dark and invisible, which men had not seen. This
                        planet, $N$, could pull on Uranus. They calculated where such a planet
                        would have to be in order to cause the observed perturbations. They sent
                        messages to the respective observatories, saying, “Gentlemen, point
                        your telescope to such and such a place, and you will see a new
                        planet.”  It often depends on with whom you are working as to whether
                        they pay any attention to you or not. They did pay attention to
                        Le Verrier; they looked, and
                        there planet $N$ was! The other observatory then also looked very
                        quickly in the next few days and saw it too.</p>

                        <p class="p">This discovery shows that Newton’s laws are absolutely right in the solar system; but do they extend
                        beyond the relatively small distances of the nearest planets? The first
                        test lies in the question, do <em class="emph">stars</em> attract <em class="emph">each other</em> as
                        well as planets? We have definite evidence that they do in the
                        <em class="emph">double stars</em>. Figure <a href="#Ch7-F6">7–6</a> shows a
                        double star—two stars very close together (there is also a third star
                        in the picture so that we will know that the photograph was not turned).
                        The stars are also shown as they appeared several years later. We see
                        that, relative to the “fixed” star, the axis of the pair has rotated,
                        i.e., the two stars are going around each other. Do they rotate
                        according to Newton’s laws? Careful
                        measurements of the relative positions of one such double star system
                        are shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F7">7–7</a>. There we see a beautiful ellipse, the
                        measures starting in 1862 and going all the way around to 1904 (by now
                        it must have gone around once more). Everything coincides with
                        Newton’s laws, except that the star
                        Sirius A is <em class="emph">not at the focus</em>. Why should that be?  Because the
                        plane of the ellipse is not in the “plane of the sky.” We are not
                        looking at right angles to the orbit plane, and when an ellipse is
                        viewed at a tilt, it remains an ellipse but the focus is no longer at
                        the same place. Thus we can analyze double stars, moving about each
                        other, according to the requirements of the gravitational law.</p>

                        <p class="p">That the law of gravitation is true at even bigger distances is
                        indicated in Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F8">7–8</a>. If one cannot see gravitation acting
                        here, he has no soul. This figure shows one of the most beautiful things
                        in the sky—a globular star cluster. All of the dots are stars.
                        Although they look as if they are packed solid toward the center, that
                        is due to the fallibility of our instruments. Actually, the distances
                        between even the centermost stars are very great and they very rarely
                        collide. There are more stars in the interior than farther out, and as
                        we move outward there are fewer and fewer. It is obvious that there is
                        an attraction among these stars. It is clear that gravitation exists at
                        these enormous dimensions, perhaps $100{,}000$ times the size of the
                        solar system. Let us now go further, and look at an <em class="emph">entire
                            galaxy</em>, shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F9">7–9</a>. The shape of this galaxy
                        indicates an obvious tendency for its matter to agglomerate. Of course
                        we cannot prove that the law here is precisely inverse square, only that
                        there is still an attraction, at this enormous dimension, that holds the
                        whole thing together. One may say, “Well, that is all very clever but
                        why is it not just a ball?”  Because it is <em class="emph">spinning</em> and has
                        <em class="emph">angular momentum</em> which it cannot give up
                        as it contracts; it must contract mostly in a plane. (Incidentally, if
                        you are looking for a good problem, the exact details of how the arms
                        are formed and what determines the shapes of these galaxies has not been
                        worked out.) It is, however, clear that the shape of the galaxy is due
                        to gravitation even though the complexities of its structure have not
                        yet allowed us to analyze it completely. In a galaxy we have a scale of
                        perhaps $50{,}000$ to $100{,}000$ light years. The earth’s distance from
                        the sun is $8\tfrac{1}{3}$ light <em class="emph">minutes</em>, so you can see how
                        large these dimensions are.</p>

                        gravitational attractions of the pieces of dust for one another might
                        make them form little lumps. Barely visible in the figure are “little”
                        black spots which may be the beginning of the accumulations of dust and
                        gases which, due to their gravitation, begin to form stars. Whether we
                        have ever seen a star form or not is still debatable.
                        Figure <a href="#Ch7-F12">7–12</a> shows the one piece of evidence which suggests

                        accumulated, has gravity acted hard enough and collected it into a ball
                        big enough that the stellar nuclear reaction starts in the interior and
                        turns it into a star? Perhaps, and perhaps not. It is unreasonable that

                        a force between <em class="emph">any</em> pair of objects, we ought to be able to
                        measure the force between our own objects. Instead of having to watch
                        the stars go around each other, why can we not take a ball of lead and a
                        marble and watch the marble go toward the ball of lead? The difficulty
                        of this experiment when done in such a simple manner is the very
                        weakness or delicacy of the force. It must be done with extreme care,
                        which means covering the apparatus to keep the air out, making sure it
                        is not electrically charged, and so on; then the force can be measured.
                        It was first measured by Cavendish with an apparatus which is schematically indicated in
                        Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F13">7–13</a>. This first demonstrated the direct force between
                        two large, fixed balls of lead and two smaller balls of lead on the ends
                        of an arm supported by a very fine fiber, called a torsion fiber. By
                        measuring how much the fiber gets twisted, one can measure the strength
                        of the force, verify that it is inversely proportional to the square of
                        the distance, and determine how strong it is. Thus, one may accurately
                        determine the coefficient $G$ in the formula
                        \begin{equation*}
                        F=G\,\frac{mm'}{r^2}.
                        \end{equation*}
                        All the masses and distances are known. You say, “We knew it already
                        for the earth.” Yes, but we did not know the <em class="emph">mass</em> of the earth.
                        By knowing $G$ from this experiment and by knowing how strongly the
                        earth attracts, we can indirectly learn how great is the mass of the
                        earth! This experiment has been called “weighing the earth” by some
                        people, and it can be used to determine the coefficient $G$ of the
                        gravity law. This is the only way in which the mass of the earth can be
                        determined. $G$ turns out to be
                        \begin{equation*}
                        6.670\times10^{-11}\text{ newton}\cdot\text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2.

                        laws that they have this abstract character. The law of conservation of
                        energy is a theorem concerning quantities that have to be calculated and
                        added together, with no mention of the machinery, and likewise the great
                        laws of mechanics are quantitative mathematical laws for which no
                        machinery is available. Why can we use mathematics to describe nature
                        without a mechanism behind it? No one knows. We have to keep going
                        because we find out more that way.</p>

                        <p class="p">Many mechanisms for gravitation have been suggested. It is interesting
                        to consider one of these, which many people have thought of from time to
                        time. At first, one is quite excited and happy when he “discovers” it,
                        but he soon finds that it is not correct. It was first discovered about
                        1750. Suppose there were many particles moving in space at a very high
                        speed in all directions and being only slightly absorbed in going
                        through matter. When they <em class="emph">are</em> absorbed, they give an impulse to
                        the earth. However, since there are as many going one way as another,
                        the impulses all balance. But when the sun is nearby, the particles
                        coming toward the earth through the sun are partially absorbed, so fewer
                        of them are coming from the sun than are coming from the other side.
                        Therefore, the earth feels a net impulse toward the sun and it does not
                        take one long to see that it is inversely as the square of the
                        distance—because of the variation of the solid angle that the sun
                        subtends as we vary the distance. What is wrong with that machinery? It
                        involves some new consequences which are <em class="emph">not true</em>. This
                        particular idea has the following trouble: the earth, in moving around
                        the sun, would impinge on more particles which are coming from its
                        forward side than from its hind side (when you run in the rain, the rain
                        in your face is stronger than that on the back of your head!). Therefore
                        there would be more impulse given the earth from the front, and the
                        earth would feel a <em class="emph">resistance to motion</em> and would be slowing up
                        in its orbit. One can calculate how long it would take for the earth to
                        stop as a result of this resistance, and it would not take long enough
                        for the earth to still be in its orbit, so this mechanism does not work.
                        No machinery has ever been invented that “explains” gravity without
                        also predicting some other phenomenon that does <em class="emph">not</em> exist.</p>

                        <p class="p">Next we shall discuss the possible relation of gravitation to other
                        forces. There is no explanation of gravitation in terms of other forces
                        at the present time. It is not an aspect of electricity or anything like
                        that, so we have no explanation. However, gravitation and other forces
                        are very similar, and it is interesting to note analogies. For example,
                        the force of electricity between two charged objects looks just like the
                        law of gravitation: the force of electricity is a constant, with a minus
                        sign, times the product of the charges, and varies inversely as the
                        square of the distance. It is in the opposite direction—likes repel.
                        But is it still not very remarkable that the two laws involve the same
                        function of distance? Perhaps gravitation and electricity are much more
                        closely related than we think. Many attempts have been made to unify
                        them; the so-called unified field theory is only a very elegant attempt
                        to combine electricity and gravitation; but, in comparing gravitation
                        and electricity, the most interesting thing is the <em class="emph">relative
                            strengths</em> of the forces. Any theory that contains them both must also
                        deduce how strong the gravity is.</p>

                        <p class="p">If we take, in some natural units, the repulsion of two electrons
                        (nature’s universal charge) due to electricity, and the attraction of
                        two electrons due to their masses, we can measure the ratio of
                        electrical repulsion to the gravitational attraction. The ratio is
                        independent of the distance and is a fundamental constant of nature. The
                        ratio is shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F14">7–14</a>. The gravitational attraction
                        relative to the electrical repulsion between two electrons is $1$
                        divided by $4.17\times10^{42}$! The question is, where does such a large
                        number come from? It is not accidental, like the ratio of the volume of
                        the earth to the volume of a flea. We have considered two natural
                        aspects of the same thing, an electron. This fantastic number is a
                        natural constant, so it involves something deep in nature. Where could
                        such a tremendous number come from? Some say that we shall one day find
                        the “universal equation,” and in it, one of the roots will be this
                        number. It is very difficult to find an equation for which such a
                        fantastic number is a natural root. Other possibilities have been
                        thought of; one is to relate it to the age of the universe. Clearly, we
                        have to find <em class="emph">another</em> large number somewhere. But do we mean the
                        age of the universe in <em class="emph">years?</em> No, because years are not
                        “natural”; they were devised by men. As an example of something
                        natural, let us consider the time it takes light to go across a proton,
                        $10^{-24}$ second. If we compare this time with the <em class="emph">age of the
                            universe</em>, $2\times10^{10}$ years, the answer is $10^{-42}$. It has
                        about the same number of zeros going off it, so it has been proposed
                        that the gravitational constant is related to the age of the universe.
                        If that were the case, the gravitational constant would change with
                        time, because as the universe got older the ratio of the age of the
                        universe to the time which it takes for light to go across a proton
                        would be gradually increasing. Is it possible that the gravitational
                        constant <em class="emph">is</em> changing with time? Of course the changes would be so
                        small that it is quite difficult to be sure.</p>

                        <p class="p">One test which we can think of is to determine what would have been the
                        effect of the change during the past $10^9$ years, which is
                        approximately the age from the earliest life on the earth to now, and
                        one-tenth of the age of the universe. In this time, the gravity constant
                        would have increased by about $10$ percent. It turns out that if we
                        consider the structure of the sun—the balance between the weight of
                        its material and the rate at which radiant energy is generated inside it—we can
                        deduce that if the gravity were $10$ percent stronger, the sun would be
                        much more than $10$ percent brighter—by the <em class="emph">sixth power</em> of the
                        gravity constant! If we calculate what happens to the orbit of the earth
                        when the gravity is changing, we find that the earth was then
                        <em class="emph">closer in</em>. Altogether, the earth would be about $100$ degrees
                        centigrade hotter, and all of the water would not have been in the sea,
                        but vapor in the air, so life would not have started in the sea. So we
                        do <em class="emph">not</em> now believe that the gravity constant is changing with the
                        age of the universe. But such arguments as the one we have just given
                        are not very convincing, and the subject is not completely closed.</p>

                        <p class="p">It is a fact that the force of gravitation is proportional to the
                        <em class="emph">mass</em>, the quantity which is fundamentally a measure of
                        <em class="emph">inertia</em>—of how hard it is to hold something
                        which is going around in a circle. Therefore two objects, one heavy and
                        one light, going around a larger object in the same circle at the same
                        speed because of gravity, will stay together because to go in a circle
                        <em class="emph">requires</em> a force which is stronger for a bigger mass. That is,
                        the gravity is stronger for a given mass in <em class="emph">just the right
                            proportion</em> so that the two objects will go around together. If one
                        object were inside the other it would <em class="emph">stay</em> inside; it is a
                        perfect balance. Therefore, Gagarin or Titov would find things
                        “weightless” inside a space ship; if they happened to let go of a
                        piece of chalk, for example, it would go around the earth in exactly the
                        same way as the whole space ship, and so it would appear to remain
                        suspended before them in space. It is very interesting that this force
                        is <em class="emph">exactly</em> proportional to the mass with great precision, because
                        if it were not exactly proportional there would be some effect by which
                        inertia and weight would differ. The absence of such an effect has been
                        checked with great accuracy by an experiment done first by
                        Eötvös in 1909 and more
                        recently by Dicke. For all
                        substances tried, the masses and weights are exactly proportional within
                        $1$ part in $1{,}000{,}000{,}000$, or less. This is a remarkable
                        experiment.</p>

                        <p class="p">Another topic deserving discussion is Einstein’s modification of
                        Newton’s law of gravitation. In spite of all the excitement it created,
                        Newton’s law of gravitation is not correct! It was modified by Einstein
                        to take into account the theory of relativity. According to Newton, the
                        gravitational effect is instantaneous, that is, if we were to move a
                        mass, we would at once feel a new force because of the new position of
                        that mass; by such means we could send signals at infinite speed.
                        Einstein advanced arguments which suggest that we <em class="emph">cannot send
                            signals faster than the speed of light</em>, so the law of gravitation must
                        be wrong. By correcting it to take the delays into account, we have a
                        new law, called Einstein’s law of gravitation. One feature of this new
                        law which is quite easy to understand is this: In the Einstein
                        relativity theory, anything which has
                        <em class="emph">energy</em> has mass—mass in the sense that it is attracted
                        gravitationally. Even light, which has an energy, has a “mass.” When a
                        light beam, which has energy in it, comes past the sun there is an
                        attraction on it by the sun. Thus the light does not go straight, but is
                        deflected. During the eclipse of the sun, for example, the stars which
                        are around the sun should appear displaced from where they would be if
                        the sun were not there, and this has been observed.</p>

                        <p class="p">Finally, let us compare gravitation with other theories. In recent years
                        we have discovered that all mass is made of tiny particles and that
                        there are several kinds of interactions, such as nuclear forces, etc.
                        None of these nuclear or electrical forces has yet been found to explain
                        gravitation. The quantum-mechanical aspects of nature have not yet been
                        carried over to gravitation. When the scale is so small that we need the
                        quantum effects, the gravitational effects are so weak that the need for
                        a quantum theory of gravitation has not yet developed. On the other
                        hand, for consistency in our physical theories it would be important to
                        see whether Newton’s law modified to Einstein’s law can be further
                        modified to be consistent with the uncertainty
                        principle. This last modification has not yet been completed.
