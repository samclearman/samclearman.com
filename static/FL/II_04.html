<div id="Ch4-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We begin now our detailed study of the theory of
electromagnetism. All of electromagnetism is contained in the Maxwell
equations.
<br><br>
<em class="emph">&emsp;&emsp;Maxwell’s equations:</em>
\begin{align}
\label{Eq:II:4:1}
\FLPdiv{\FLPE}&=\frac{\rho}{\epsO},\\[1ex]
\label{Eq:II:4:2}
\FLPcurl{\FLPE}&=-\ddp{\FLPB}{t},\\[1ex]
\label{Eq:II:4:3}
c^2\,\FLPcurl{\FLPB}&=\ddp{\FLPE}{t}+\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO},\\[1ex]
\label{Eq:II:4:4}
\FLPdiv{\FLPB}&=0.
\end{align}
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch4-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">The situations that are described by these equations can be very
complicated.  We will consider first relatively simple situations, and
learn how to handle them before we take up more complicated ones. The
easiest circumstance to treat is one in which nothing depends on the
time—called the <em class="emph">static</em> case. All charges are permanently
fixed in space, or if they do move, they move as a steady flow in a
circuit (so $\rho$ and&nbsp;$\FLPj$ are constant in time). In these
circumstances, all of the terms in the Maxwell equations which are time derivatives
of the field are zero. In this case, the Maxwell
equations
become:
<br><br>
<em class="emph">&emsp;&emsp;Electrostatics:</em>
\begin{align}
\label{Eq:II:4:5}
\FLPdiv{\FLPE}&=\frac{\rho}{\epsO},\\[1ex]
\label{Eq:II:4:6}
\FLPcurl{\FLPE}&=\FLPzero.
\end{align}
<em class="emph">&emsp;&emsp;Magnetostatics:</em>
\begin{align}
\label{Eq:II:4:7}
\FLPcurl{\FLPB}&=\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO c^2},\\[1ex]
\label{Eq:II:4:8}
\FLPdiv{\FLPB}&=0.
\end{align}
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch4-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">You will notice an interesting thing about this set of four equations.
It can be separated into two pairs. The electric field&nbsp;$\FLPE$ appears
only in the first two, and the magnetic field&nbsp;$\FLPB$ appears only in
the second two. The two fields are not interconnected. This means that
<em class="emph">electricity and magnetism are distinct phenomena so long as
charges and currents are static</em>. The interdependence of $\FLPE$
and&nbsp;$\FLPB$ does not appear until there are changes in charges or
currents, as when a condensor is charged, or a magnet moved. Only when
there are sufficiently rapid changes, so that the time derivatives in
Maxwell’s equations become
significant, will $\FLPE$ and&nbsp;$\FLPB$ depend on each other.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch4-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Now if you look at the equations of statics you will see that the study
of the two subjects we call electrostatics and magnetostatics is ideal
from the point of view of learning about the mathematical properties of
vector fields. Electrostatics is a neat example of a vector field with
<em class="emph">zero curl</em> and a <em class="emph">given divergence</em>.
Magnetostatics is a neat example of a field with <em class="emph">zero
divergence</em> and a <em class="emph">given curl</em>. The more
conventional—and you may be thinking, more satisfactory—way of
presenting the theory of electromagnetism is to start first with
electrostatics and thus to learn about the divergence. Magnetostatics
and the curl are taken up later. Finally, electricity and magnetism are
put together. We have chosen to start with the complete theory of vector
calculus. Now we shall apply it to the special case of electrostatics,
the field of&nbsp;$\FLPE$ given by the first pair of equations.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch4-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We will begin with the simplest situations—ones in which the
positions of all charges are specified. If we had only to study
electrostatics at this level (as we shall do in the next two
chapters), life would be very simple—in fact, almost
trivial. Everything can be obtained from
Coulomb’s law and some
integration, as you will see. In many real electrostatic problems,
however, we do not <em class="emph">know</em>, initially, where the charges are. We
know only that they have distributed themselves in ways that depend on
the properties of matter. The positions that the charges take up
depend on the $\FLPE$&nbsp;field, which in turn depends on the positions of
the charges. Then things can get quite complicated. If, for instance,
a charged body is brought near a conductor or insulator, the electrons
and protons in the conductor or insulator will move around. The charge
density&nbsp;$\rho$ in Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII45">4.5</a>) may have one part that we
know about, from the charge that we brought up; but there will be
other parts from charges that have moved around in the conductor. And
all of the charges must be taken into account. One can get into some
rather subtle and interesting problems. So although this chapter is to
be on electrostatics, it will not cover the more beautiful and subtle
parts of the subject. It will treat only the situation where we can
assume that the positions of all the charges are known. Naturally, you
should be able to do that case before you try to handle the other

the work done in carrying a charge from one point to another. There is
some distribution of charge, which produces an electric field. We ask
about how much work it would take to carry a small charge from one
place to another. The work done <em class="emph">against</em> the electrical forces
in carrying a charge along some path is the <em class="emph">negative</em> of the
component of the electrical force in the direction of the motion,
integrated along the path. If we carry a charge from point&nbsp;$a$ to
point&nbsp;$b$,
\begin{equation*}
W=-\int_a^b\FLPF\cdot d\FLPs,
\end{equation*}
where&nbsp;$\FLPF$ is the electrical force <em class="emph">on</em> the charge at each

<p class="p">It is more interesting for our purposes to consider the work that

write
\begin{equation}

W(\text{unit})=-\int_a^b\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs.

<div id="Ch4-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We will now derive a field equation that depends specifically and
directly on the fact that the force law is inverse square. That the
field varies inversely as the square of the distance seems, for some
people, to be “only natural,” because “that’s the way things spread
out.” Take a light source with light streaming out: the amount of
light that passes through a surface cut out by a cone with its apex at
the source is the same no matter at what radius the surface is
placed. It must be so if there is to be conservation of light
energy. The amount of light per unit area—the intensity—must vary
inversely as the area cut by the cone, i.,e., inversely as the square
of the distance from the source. Certainly the electric field should
vary inversely as the square of the distance for the same reason! But
there is no such thing as the “same reason” here. Nobody can say
that the electric field measures the flow of something like light
which must be conserved. <em class="emph">If</em> we had a “model” of the electric
field in which the electric field vector represented the direction and
speed—say the current—of some kind of little “bullets” which
were flying out, <em class="emph">and</em> if our model required that these bullets
were conserved, that none could ever disappear once it was shot out of
a charge, then we might say that we can “see” that the inverse
square law is necessary. On the other hand, there would necessarily be
some mathematical way to express this physical idea. If the electric
field <em class="emph">were</em> like conserved bullets going out, then it would vary
inversely as the square of the distance and we would be able to
describe that behavior by an equation—which is purely
mathematical. Now there is no harm in thinking this way, so long as we
do not say that the electric field <em class="emph">is made</em> out of bullets, but
realize that we are using a model to help us find the right
mathematics.

that whatever it is flows out of a charge into the space around.
If&nbsp;$\FLPE$ were the vector of such a flow (as&nbsp;$\FLPh$ is for heat flow),
it would have a&nbsp;$1/r^2$ dependence near a point source. Now we wish to
use this model to find out how to state the inverse square law in a
deeper or more abstract way, rather than simply saying “inverse
square.” (You may wonder why we should want to avoid the direct
statement of such a simple law, and want instead to imply the same

the&nbsp;$\FLPE$ field is like a flow, the net flow out of this box should be
zero.  That is what we get if by the “flow” from this surface we
mean the surface integral of the normal component of&nbsp;$\FLPE$—that
is, the flux of&nbsp;$\FLPE$. On the radial faces, the normal component is
zero. On the spherical faces, the normal component&nbsp;$E_n$ is just the
magnitude of&nbsp;$\FLPE$—minus for the smaller face and plus for the

surface area is proportional to&nbsp;$r^2$, so the product is independent
of&nbsp;$r$. The flux of&nbsp;$\FLPE$ into face&nbsp;$a$ is just cancelled by the
flux out of face&nbsp;$b$. The total flow out of&nbsp;$S$ is zero, which is to

radial, but whose “ends” are tilted. The end surfaces are not small in
the figure, but you are to imagine the situation for very small end

factor&nbsp;$1/\cos\theta$. But&nbsp;$E_n$, the component of&nbsp;$\FLPE$ normal to the

point charge. Now suppose that there are two charges, a charge&nbsp;$q_1$
at one point and a charge&nbsp;$q_2$ at another. The problem looks more
difficult. The electric field whose normal component we integrate for
the flux is the field due to both charges. That is, if&nbsp;$\FLPE_1$
represents the electric field that would have been produced by&nbsp;$q_1$
alone, and&nbsp;$\FLPE_2$ represents the electric field produced by&nbsp;$q_2$
alone, the total electric field is $\FLPE=\FLPE_1+\FLPE_2$. The flux
through any closed surface&nbsp;$S$ is
\begin{equation}

\int_S(E_{1n}\!+\!E_{2n})\,da=\!\!\int_S E_{1n}\,da+\!\!\int_S E_{2n}\,da.

The flux with both charges present is the flux due to a single charge

the flux through&nbsp;$S$ is zero. If&nbsp;$q_1$ is inside&nbsp;$S$ but&nbsp;$q_2$ is

give its contribution and we have that the flux is

charge, it never stops. In terms of the field lines, Gauss’
law
says
that lines should start only at plus charges and stop at minus
charges. The number which <em class="emph">leave</em> a charge&nbsp;$q$ must be equal
to&nbsp;$q/\epsO$.

<p class="p">Now, we can find a similar geometrical picture for the
potential&nbsp;$\phi$. The easiest way to represent the potential is to draw surfaces
on which&nbsp;$\phi$ is a constant. We call them <em class="emph">equipotential</em>
surfaces—surfaces of equal potential. Now what is the geometrical
relationship of the equipotential surfaces to the field lines? The
electric field is the gradient of the potential. The gradient is in
the direction of the most rapid change of the potential, and is
therefore perpendicular to an equipotential surface. If&nbsp;$\FLPE$ were
<em class="emph">not</em> perpendicular to the surface, it would have a component
<em class="emph">in</em> the surface. The potential would be changing in the surface,
but then it wouldn’t be an equipotential. The equipotential surfaces
must then be everywhere at right angles to the electric field lines.

</div>

<div id="Ch4-S8-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">For a point charge all by itself, the equipotential surfaces are
spheres centered at the charge. We have shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch4-F12">4-12</a>
the intersection of these spheres with a plane through the charge.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch4-S8-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">As a second example, we consider the field near two equal charges, a
positive one and a negative one. To get the field is easy. The field
is the superposition of the fields from each of the two charges. So,
we can take two pictures like Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch4-F12">4-12</a> and superimpose
them—impossible! Then we would have field lines crossing each other,
and that’s not possible, because&nbsp;$\FLPE$ can’t have <em class="emph">two</em>
directions at the same point. The disadvantage of the field-line
picture is now evident. By geometrical arguments it is impossible to
analyze in a very simple way where the new lines go. From the two
independent pictures, we can’t get the combined picture. The principle
of superposition, a simple and deep principle about electric fields,
does not have, in the field-line picture, an easy representation.

<div id="Ch4-S8-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">The field-line picture has its uses, however, so we might still like
to draw the picture for a pair of equal (and opposite) charges. If we
calculate the fields from Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII413">4.13</a>) and the potentials
from&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII424">4.24</a>), we can draw the field lines and
equipotentials. Figure&nbsp;<a href="#Ch4-F13">4-13</a> shows the result. But we
first had to solve the problem mathematically!
