living. The radio reports speaking of tomorrow’s weather may say:
“There is a sixty percent chance of rain.” You might say: “There is a
small chance that I shall live to be one hundred years old.” Scientists
also use the word chance. A seismologist may be interested in the
question: “What is the chance that there will be an earthquake of a
certain size in Southern California next year?” A physicist might ask
the question: “What is the chance that a particular geiger counter will
register twenty counts in the next ten seconds?” A politician or
statesman might be interested in the question: “What is the chance that
there will be a nuclear war within the next ten years?” You may be
interested in the chance that you will learn something from this

<p class="p">By <em class="emph">chance</em>, we mean something like a guess. Why do we make
guesses? We make guesses when we wish to make a judgment but have
incomplete information or uncertain knowledge. We want to make a guess
as to what things are, or what things are likely to happen. Often we
wish to make a guess because we have to make a decision. For example:
Shall I take my raincoat with me tomorrow? For what earth movement
should I design a new building? Shall I build myself a fallout shelter?
Shall I change my stand in international negotiations? Shall I go to
class today?</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Sometimes we make guesses because we wish, with our limited knowledge,
to say as much as we <em class="emph">can</em> about some situation. Really, any
generalization is in the nature of a guess. Any physical theory is a
kind of guesswork. There are good guesses and there are bad guesses. The
theory of probability is a system for making better guesses. The
language of probability allows us to speak quantitatively about some
situation which may be highly variable, but which does have some
consistent average behavior.</p>

<div id="Ch6-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Let us consider the flipping of a coin. If the toss—and the coin—are
“honest,” we have no way of knowing what to expect for the outcome of
any particular toss. Yet we would feel that in a large number of tosses
there should be about equal numbers of heads and tails. We say: “The
probability that a toss will land heads is $0.5$.”</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We speak of probability only for observations that we contemplate being
made in the future. <em class="emph">By the “probability” of a particular outcome
of an observation we mean our estimate for the most likely fraction of a
number of repeated observations that will yield that particular
outcome</em>. If we imagine repeating an observation—such as looking at a
freshly tossed coin—$N$ times, and if we call $N_A$ <em class="emph">our
estimate</em> of the most likely number of our observations that will give
some specified result $A$, say the result “heads,” then by $P(A)$, the
probability of observing $A$, we mean
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:1}
P(A)=N_A/N.
\end{equation}</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Our definition requires several comments. First of all, we may speak of
a probability of something happening only if the occurrence is a
possible outcome of some <em class="emph">repeatable</em> observation. It is not clear
that it would make any sense to ask: “What is the probability that
there is a ghost in that house?”</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">You may object that no situation is <em class="emph">exactly</em> repeatable. That is
right. Every different observation must at least be at a different time
or place. All we can say is that the “repeated” observations should,
for our intended purposes, <em class="emph">appear to be equivalent</em>. We should
assume, at least, that each observation was made from an equivalently
prepared situation, and especially with the same degree of ignorance at
the start. (If we sneak a look at an opponent’s hand in a card game, our
estimate of our chances of winning are different than if we do not!)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">We should emphasize that $N$ and $N_A$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI61">6.1</a>) are
<em class="emph">not</em> intended to represent numbers based on actual observations.
$N_A$ is our best <em class="emph">estimate</em> of what <em class="emph">would</em> occur in $N$
<em class="emph">imagined</em> observations. Probability depends, therefore, on our
knowledge and on our ability to make estimates. In effect, on our common
sense!  Fortunately, there is a certain amount of agreement in the
common sense of many things, so that different people will make the same
estimate. Probabilities need not, however, be “absolute” numbers.
Since they depend on our ignorance, they may become different if our
knowledge changes.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">You may have noticed another rather “subjective” aspect of our
definition of probability. We have referred to $N_A$ as “our estimate
of the most likely number …” We do not mean that we expect to
observe <em class="emph">exactly</em> $N_A$, but that we expect a number
<em class="emph">near</em> $N_A$, and that the number $N_A$ is <em class="emph">more likely</em> than
any other number in the vicinity. If we toss a coin, say, $30$ times, we
should expect that the number of heads would not be very likely to be
exactly $15$, but rather only some number near to $15$, say $12$, $13$,
$14$, $15$, $16$, or $17$. However, if we <em class="emph">must</em> choose, we would
decide that $15$ heads is <em class="emph">more likely</em> than any other number. We
would write $P(\text{heads})=0.5$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Why did we choose $15$ as more likely than any other number? We must
have argued with ourselves in the following manner: If the most likely
number of heads is $N_H$ in a total number of tosses $N$, then the most
likely number of tails $N_T$ is $(N-N_H)$. (We are assuming that every
toss gives <em class="emph">either</em> heads <em class="emph">or</em> tails, and no “other”
result!) But if the coin is “honest,” there is no preference for heads
or tails. Until we have some reason to think the coin (or toss) is
dishonest, we must give equal likelihoods for heads and tails. So we
must set $N_T=N_H$. It follows that $N_T=$ $N_H=$ $N/2$, or $P(H)=$ $P(T)=$ $0.5$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch6-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">We can generalize our reasoning to <em class="emph">any</em> situation in which there
are $m$ different but “equivalent” (that is, equally likely) possible
results of an observation. If an observation can yield $m$ different
results, and we have reason to believe that any one of them is as likely
as any other, then the probability of a <em class="emph">particular</em> outcome $A$
is $P(A)=1/m$.</p>

<p class="p">If there are seven different-colored balls in an opaque box and we pick
one out “at random” (that is, without looking), the probability of

ten of hearts is $\tfrac{1}{52}$. The probability of throwing a

<p class="p"><span class="text small">In Chapter <a href="I_05.html">5</a> we described the size of a nucleus in terms of
its apparent area, or “cross section.” When we did so we were really
talking about probabilities. When we shoot a high-energy particle at a
thin slab of material, there is some chance that it will pass right
through and some chance that it will hit a nucleus. (Since the nucleus
is so small that we cannot <em class="emph">see</em> it, we cannot aim right at a
nucleus. We must “shoot blind.”) If there are $n$ atoms in our slab
and the nucleus of each atom has a cross-sectional area $\sigma$, then
the total area “shadowed” by the nuclei is $n\sigma$. In a large
number $N$ of random shots, we expect that the number of hits $N_C$ of

to the total area of the slab:

<p class="p">Looking at the numbers in Table <a href="#Ch6-T1">6–1</a>, we see that most of the
results are “near” $15$, in that they are between $12$ and $18$. We
can get a better feeling for the details of these results if we plot a
graph of the <em class="emph">distribution</em> of the results. We count the number of
games in which a score of $k$ was obtained, and plot this number for
each $k$. Such a graph is shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6–2</a>. A score of
$15$ heads was obtained in $13$ games. A score of $14$ heads was also
obtained $13$ times. Scores of $16$ and $17$ were each obtained
<em class="emph">more</em> than $13$ times. Are we to conclude that there is some bias
toward heads? Was our “best estimate” not good enough?  Should we
conclude now that the “most likely” score for a run of $30$ tosses is
really $16$ heads? But wait! In all the games taken together, there were
$3000$ tosses. And the total number of heads obtained was $1493$. The
fraction of tosses that gave heads is $0.498$, very nearly, but slightly
<em class="emph">less</em> than half. We should certainly <em class="emph">not</em> assume that the
probability of throwing heads is greater than $0.5$!  The fact that one
<em class="emph">particular</em> set of observations gave $16$ heads most often, is a

<p class="p">We may ask the question: “What <em class="emph">is</em> the probability that a game of

have said that in a game of one toss, the probability of obtaining

is $0.5$. In a game of two tosses there are <em class="emph">four</em> possible
outcomes: $HH$, $HT$, $TH$, $TT$. Since each of these sequences is
equally likely, we conclude that (a) the probability of a score of two

<p class="p">The argument we have been making can be summarized by a diagram like
that in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F3">6–3</a>. It is clear how the diagram should be
continued for games with a larger number of tosses.
Figure <a href="#Ch6-F4">6–4</a> shows such a diagram for a game of $6$ tosses.
The number of “ways” to any point on the diagram is just the number of
different “paths” (sequences of heads and tails) which can be taken
from the starting point. The vertical position gives us the total number
of heads thrown. The set of numbers which appears in such a diagram is
known as <em class="emph">Pascal’s triangle</em>. The numbers are also known as
the <em class="emph">binomial coefficients</em>, because they also appear in the
expansion of $(a+b)^n$. If we call $n$ the number of tosses and $k$ the
number of heads thrown, then the numbers in the diagram are usually
designated by the symbol $\tbinom{n}{k}$. We may remark in passing that
the binomial coefficients can also be computed from
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:6:4}
\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!},
\end{equation}
where $n!$, called “$n$-factorial,” represents the

total number of possible sequences is $2^n$ (since there are
$2$ outcomes for each toss), and the number of ways of obtaining
$k$ heads is $\tbinom{n}{k}$, all equally likely, so we have

$100\cdot P(k,n)$ times. The dashed curve in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6–2</a> passes
through the points computed from $100\cdot P(k,30)$. We see that we
<em class="emph">expect</em> to obtain a score of $15$ heads in $14$ or $15$ games,
whereas this score was observed in $13$ games. We <em class="emph">expect</em> a score

or $L$ in a single event need not be equal. Let $p$ be the probability
of obtaining the result $W$. Then $q$, the probability of $L$, is
necessarily $(1-p)$. In a set of $n$ trials, the probability $P(k,n)$
that $W$ will be obtained $k$ times is

<span class="tag">6–3</span>The random walk</h3>
<div id="Ch6-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">There is another interesting problem in which the idea of probability is
required. It is the problem of the “random walk.” In its simplest
version, we imagine a “game” in which a “player” starts at the
point $x=0$ and at each “move” is required to take a step
<em class="emph">either</em> forward (toward $+x$) <em class="emph">or</em> backward (toward $-x$).
The choice is to be made <em class="emph">randomly</em>, determined, for example, by
the toss of a coin. How shall we describe the resulting motion? In its
general form the problem is related to the motion of atoms (or other
particles) in a gas—called Brownian
motion—and also to the combination of
errors in measurements. You will see that the random-walk problem is
closely related to the coin-tossing problem we have already discussed.

</div>
<div id="Ch6-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">First, let us look at a few examples of a random walk. We may
characterize the walker’s progress by the net distance $D_N$ traveled in
$N$ steps. We show in the graph of Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F5">6–5</a> three examples

he get on the average?” We must <em class="emph">expect</em> that his average progress

backward. But we have the feeling that as $N$ increases, he is more
likely to have strayed farther from the starting point. We might,
therefore, ask what is his average distance travelled in <em class="emph">absolute
value</em>, that is, what is the average of $\abs{D}$. It
is, however, more convenient to deal with another measure of
“progress,” the square of the distance: $D^2$ is positive for either
positive or negative motion, and is therefore a reasonable
<em class="emph">measure</em> of such random wandering.</p>

behavior in <em class="emph">many repeated</em> sequences. We represent such an
expected value by $\expval{D_N^2}$, and may refer to it also as the
“mean square distance.”  After one step,
$D^2$ is always $+1$, so we have certainly $\expval{D_1^2}=1$. (All

currents, so that the air is circulating, the currents will also carry
the vapor with them. But even in <em class="emph">perfectly still air</em>, the vapor
will gradually spread out—will diffuse—until it has penetrated
throughout the room. We might detect it by its color or odor. The
individual molecules of the organic vapor spread out in still air
because of the molecular motions caused by collisions with other
molecules. If we know the average “step” size, and the number of steps
taken per second, we can find the probability that one, or several,
molecules will be found at some distance from their starting point after
any particular passage of time. As time passes, more steps are taken and
the gas spreads out as in the successive curves of Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F7">6–7</a>.

molecule may have any speed, but some speeds are more likely than
others. We describe what is going on by saying that the probability that
any particular molecule will have a speed between $v$ and $v+\Delta v$
is $p(v)\,\Delta v$, where $p(v)$, a probability density, is a given

a volume of, say, one liter), then there are a very large number $N$ of
molecules present ($N\approx10^{22}$). Since $p(v)\,\Delta v$
is the probability that <em class="emph">one</em> molecule will have its velocity
in $\Delta v$, by our definition of probability we mean that the

Since with a gas we are usually dealing with large numbers of molecules,
we expect the deviations from the expected numbers to be small
