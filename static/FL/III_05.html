<span class="tag">5–1</span>Filtering atoms with a Stern-Gerlach apparatus</h3>

<div id="Ch5-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In this chapter we really begin the quantum mechanics proper—in the
sense that we are going to describe a quantum mechanical phenomenon in
a completely quantum mechanical way. We will make no apologies and no
attempt to find connections to classical mechanics. We want to talk
about something new in a new language. The particular situation which
we are going to describe is the behavior of the so-called quantization
of the angular momentum, for a particle of <em class="emph">spin one</em>. But we
won’t use words like “angular momentum” or other concepts of
classical mechanics until later. We have chosen this particular
example because it is relatively simple, although not the simplest
possible example. It is sufficiently complicated that it can stand as
a prototype which can be generalized for the description of all
quantum mechanical phenomena. Thus, although we are dealing with a
particular example, all the laws which we mention are immediately
generalizable, and we will give the generalizations so that you will
see the general characteristics of a quantum mechanical
description. We begin with the phenomenon of the splitting of a beam
of atoms into three separate beams in a Stern-Gerlach experiment.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">You remember that if we have an inhomogeneous magnetic field made by a
magnet with a pointed pole tip and we send a beam through the
apparatus, the beam of particles may be split into a number of
beams—the number depending on the particular kind of atom and its
state. We are going to take the case of an atom which gives three
beams, and we are going to call that a particle of <em class="emph">spin
one</em>. You can do for yourself the case of five beams, seven beams, two
beams, etc.—you just copy everything down and where we have three
terms, you will have five terms, seven terms, and so on.</p>

three beams.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Imagine the apparatus drawn schematically in Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F1">5–1</a>. A
beam of atoms (or particles of any kind) is collimated by some slits and
passes through a nonuniform field. Let’s say that the beam moves in the
$y$-direction and that the magnetic field and its gradient are both in
the $z$-direction. Then, looking from the side, we will see the beam
split vertically into three beams, as shown in the figure. Now at the
output end of the magnet we could put small counters which count the
rate of arrival of particles in any one of the three beams. Or we can
block off two of the beams and let the third one go on.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose we block off the lower two beams and let the top-most beam go
on and enter a second Stern-Gerlach apparatus of the same kind, as
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F2">5–2</a>. What happens? There are <em class="emph">not</em>
three beams in the second apparatus; there is only the top
beam.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> This is what you would expect if you think of the second
apparatus as simply an extension of the first. Those atoms which are
being pushed upward continue to be pushed upward in the second magnet.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">You can see then that the first apparatus has produced a beam of
“purified” objects—atoms that get bent upward in the particular
inhomogeneous field. The atoms, as they enter the original
Stern-Gerlach apparatus, are of three “varieties,” and the three
kinds take different trajectories. By filtering out all but one of the
varieties, we can make a beam whose future behavior in the same kind
of apparatus is determined and predictable. We will call this a
<em class="emph">filtered</em> beam, or a <em class="emph">polarized</em> beam, or a beam in which
the atoms all are known to be in a <em class="emph">definite state</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">For the rest of our discussion, it will be more convenient if we
consider a somewhat modified apparatus of the Stern-Gerlach type. The
apparatus looks more complicated at first, but it will make all the
arguments simpler. Anyway, since they are only “thought
experiments,” it doesn’t cost anything to complicate the
equipment. (Incidentally, no one has ever done all of the experiments
we will describe in just this way, but we know what <em class="emph">would</em>
happen from the laws of quantum mechanics, which are, of course, based
on other similar experiments. These other experiments are harder to
understand at the beginning, so we want to describe some
idealized—but possible—experiments.)

</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Figure <a href="#Ch5-F3">5–3</a>(a) shows a drawing of the “modified
Stern-Gerlach apparatus” we would like to use. It consists of a
sequence of three high-gradient magnets. The first one (on the left) is
just the usual Stern-Gerlach magnet and splits the incoming beam of
spin-one particles into three separate beams. The second magnet has the
same cross section as the first, but is twice as long <em class="emph">and</em> the
polarity of its magnetic field is opposite the field in magnet $1$. The
second magnet pushes in the opposite direction on the atomic magnets and
bends their paths back toward the axis, as shown in the trajectories
drawn in the lower part of the figure. The third magnet is just like the
first, and brings the three beams back together again, so that leaves
the exit hole along the axis. Finally, we would like to imagine that in
front of the hole at $A$ there is some mechanism which can get the atoms
started from rest and that after the exit hole at $B$ there is a
decelerating mechanism that brings the atoms back to rest at $B$. That
is not essential, but it will mean that in our analysis we won’t have to
worry about including any effects of the motion as the atoms come out,
and can concentrate on those matters having only to do with the spin.
The whole purpose of the “improved” apparatus is just to bring all the
particles to the same place, and with zero speed.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Now if we want to do an experiment like the one in
Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F2">5–2</a>, we can first make a filtered beam by putting a
plate in the middle of the apparatus that blocks two of the beams, as
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F4">5–4</a>. If we now put the polarized atoms
through a second identical apparatus, all the atoms will take the upper
path, as can be verified by putting similar plates in the way of the
various beams of the second $S$ filter and seeing whether particles get
through.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose we call the first apparatus by the name $S$. (We are going to
consider all sorts of combinations, and we will need labels to keep
things straight.) We will say that the atoms which take the top path
in $S$ are in the “plus state with respect to $S$”; the ones which
take the middle path are in the “zero state with respect to $S$”;
and the ones which take the lowest path are in the “minus state with
respect to $S$.” (In the more usual language we would say that the
$z$-component of the angular momentum was $+1\hbar$, $0$,
and $-1\hbar$, but we are not using that language now.) Now in
Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F4">5–4</a> the second apparatus is oriented just like the
first, so the filtered atoms will all go on the upper path. Or if we had
blocked off the upper and lower beams in the first apparatus and let
only the zero state through, all the filtered atoms would go through the
middle path of the second apparatus. And if we had blocked off all but
the lowest beam in the first, there would be only a low beam in the
second. We can say that in each case our first apparatus has produced a
filtered beam in a <em class="emph">pure</em> state with respect to $S$ ($+$, $0$,
or $-$), and we can test which state is present by putting the atoms
through a second, identical apparatus.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">We can make our second apparatus so that it transmits only atoms of a
particular state—by putting masks inside it as we did for the first
one—and then we can test the state of the incoming beam just by
seeing whether anything comes out the far end. For instance, if we
block off the two lower paths in the second apparatus, $100$ percent
of the atoms will still come through; but if we block off the upper
path, nothing will get through.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">To make this kind of discussion easier, we are going to invent a
shorthand symbol to represent one of our improved Stern-Gerlach
apparatuses. We will let the symbol
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:1}
\SG{S}
\end{equation}

stand for one complete apparatus. (This is <em class="emph">not</em> a symbol you
will ever find used in quantum mechanics; we’ve just invented it for
this chapter. It is simply meant to be a shorthand picture of the
apparatus of Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F3">5–3</a>.) Since we are going to want to
use several apparatuses at once, and with various orientations, we will
identify each with a letter underneath. So the symbol
in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII51">5.1</a>) stands for the apparatus $S$. When we block off
one or more of the beams inside, we will show that by some vertical bars
indicating which beam is blocked, like this:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:2}
\SGP{S}\!\!\!\cdotp
\end{equation}

The various possible combinations we will be using are shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F5">5–5</a>.</p>

\SGP{S} \!\! \SG{S} \!\!\!\cdotp

For this setup, everything that comes through the first also gets
through the second. In fact, even if we block off the “zero” and
“minus” channels of the second apparatus, so that we have

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:4}
\SGP{S} \!\! \SGP{S} \!\!\!,

we still get $100$ percent transmission through the second
apparatus. On the other hand, if we have

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:5}
\SGP{S} \!\! \SGM{S} \!\!\!,
\end{equation}

nothing at all comes out of the far end. Similarly,

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:6}
\SGM{S} \!\! \SGP{S}

\begin{equation}

<div id="Ch5-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now comes the big question: What happens if the second apparatus is
tipped to a different angle, so that its field axis is no longer
parallel to the first? It could be not only tipped, but also pointed
in a different direction—for instance, it could take the beam off
at $90^\circ$ with respect to the original direction. To take it easy at
first, let’s first think about an arrangement in which the second
Stern-Gerlach experiment is tilted by some angle $\alpha$ about the
$y$-axis, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F6">5–6</a>. We’ll call the second
apparatus $T$. Suppose that we now set up the following experiment:
\begin{equation*}
\SGP{S} \!\! \SGP{T} \!\!\!\!,
\end{equation*}

or the experiment:

\begin{equation*}
\SGP{S} \!\! \SGZ{T} \!\!\!\!\cdotp
\end{equation*}

What comes out at the far end in these cases?</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">The answer is this: If the atoms are in a definite state with respect
to $S$, they are <em class="emph">not</em> in the same state with respect to $T$—a
$(+S)$ state is <em class="emph">not</em> also a $(+T)$ state. There <em class="emph">is</em>,
however, a certain <em class="emph">amplitude</em> to find the atom in a
$(+T)$ state—or a $(\OT)$ state or a $(-T)$ state.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">In other words, as careful as we have been to make sure that we have
the atoms in a definite condition, the fact of the matter is that if
it goes through an apparatus which is tilted at a different angle it
has, so to speak, to “reorient” itself—which it does, don’t
forget, by luck. We can put only one particle through at a time, and
then we can only ask the question: What is the probability that it
gets through? Some of the atoms that have gone through $S$ will end in
a $(+T)$ state, some of them will end in a $(\OT)$, and some in a
$(-T)$ state—all with different odds. These odds can be calculated
by the absolute squares of complex amplitudes; what we want is some
mathematical method, or quantum mechanical description, for these
amplitudes. What we need to know are various quantities like
\begin{equation*}
\braket{-T}{+S},
\end{equation*}

by which we mean the amplitude that an atom initially in the
$(+S)$ state can get into the $(-T)$ condition (which is <em class="emph">not</em> zero
unless $T$ and $S$ are lined up parallel to each other). There are
other amplitudes like
\begin{equation*}
\braket{+T}{\OS},\quad
\text{or}\quad
\braket{\OT}{-S},\quad
\text{etc}.
\end{equation*}

There are, in fact, nine such amplitudes—another matrix—that a
theory of particles should tell us how to calculate. Just as $F=ma$
tells us how to calculate what happens to a classical particle in any
circumstance, the laws of quantum mechanics permit us to determine the
amplitude that a particle will get through a particular apparatus. The
central problem, then, is to be able to calculate—for any given tilt
angle $\alpha$, or in fact for any orientation whatever—the nine
amplitudes:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:9}
\begin{alignedat}{3}
\braket{+T}{+S}&,&\quad
\braket{+T}{\OS}&,&\quad
\braket{+T}{-S}&,\\
\braket{\OT}{+S}&,&\quad
\braket{\OT}{\OS}&,&\quad
\braket{\OT}{-S}&,\\
\braket{-T}{+S}&,&\quad
\braket{-T}{\OS}&,&\quad
\braket{-T}{-S}&.
\end{alignedat}
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We can already figure out some relations among these
amplitudes. First, according to our definitions, the absolute square
\begin{equation*}
\abs{\braket{+T}{+S}}^2
\end{equation*}

is the <em class="emph">probability</em> that an atom in a $(+S)$ state will enter a
$(+T)$ state. We will often find it more convenient to write such
squares in the equivalent form
\begin{equation*}
\braket{+T}{+S}\braket{+T}{+S}\cconj.
\end{equation*}

In the same notation the number
\begin{equation*}
\braket{\OT}{+S}\braket{\OT}{+S}\cconj
\end{equation*}

is the probability that a particle in the $(+S)$ state will enter the
$(\OT)$ state, and
\begin{equation*}
\braket{-T}{+S}\braket{-T}{+S}\cconj
\end{equation*}

is the probability that it will enter the $(-T)$ state. But the way
our apparatuses are made, every atom which enters the $T$ apparatus
must be found in <em class="emph">some</em> one of the three states of the
$T$ apparatus—there’s nowhere else for a given kind of atom to go. So
the sum of the three probabilities we’ve just written must be equal to
$100$ percent. We have the relation
\begin{equation}
\begin{alignedat}{3}
&\braket{+T}{+S}&\braket{+T}{+S}&\cconj\;&+&\\[.2ex]
&\braket{\OT}{+S}&\,\braket{\OT}{+S}&\cconj&+&\\[.2ex]
&\braket{-T}{+S}&\braket{-T}{+S}&\cconj&=&\;1.
\end{alignedat}
\label{Eq:III:5:10}
\end{equation}

There are, of course, two other such equations that we get if we start
with a $(\OS)$ or a $(-S)$ state. But they are all we can easily get,
so we’ll go on to some other general questions.</p>

(We’ll call the last filter $S'$ just so we can distinguish it
from the first $S$-filter.) Do the atoms remember that they were once
in a $(+S)$ state? In other words, we have the following experiment:

independent of what precedes it. The fact that the same atoms were
once sorted by an $S$ filter has no influence whatever on what they
will do once they have been sorted again into a pure beam by a
$T$ apparatus. From then on, the probability for getting into different
states is the same no matter what happened before they got into the

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:13}
\SGZ{S} \!\! \SGZ{T} \!\! \SGZ{S'}\!\!\!\!.

The amplitude that an atom that comes out of $S$ will also get through

\begin{equation*}
\braket{+S}{\OT}\braket{\OT}{\OS}.

The corresponding probability is
\begin{equation*}
\abs{\braket{+S}{\OT}\braket{\OT}{\OS}}^2

The ratio is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\abs{\braket{\OS}{\OT}}^2}

up and down together depending on how much gets through $T$.) We

<p class="p">These results illustrate one of the basic principles of quantum
mechanics: Any atomic system can be separated by a filtering process
into a certain set of what we will call <em class="emph">base states</em>, and the
future behavior of the atoms in any single given base state depends
only on the nature of the base state—it is independent of any
previous history.<a name="footnote_source_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup class="mark">3</sup></a> The base
states depend, of course, on the filter used; for instance, the three
states $(+T)$, $(\OT)$, and $(-T)$ are one set of base states; the
three states $(+S)$, $(\OS)$, and $(-S)$ are another. There are any
number of possibilities each as good as any other.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We should be careful to say that we are considering <em class="emph">good</em>
filters which do indeed produce “pure” beams. If, for instance, our
Stern-Gerlach apparatus didn’t produce a good separation of the three
beams so that we could not separate them cleanly by our masks, then we
could not make a complete separation into base states. We can tell if
we have pure base states by seeing whether or not the beams can be
split again in another filter of the same kind. If we have a pure
$(+T)$ state, for instance, all the atoms will go through

\begin{equation*}
\SGP{T}\!\!\!\!,

and none will go through

\begin{equation*}
\SGZ{T}\!\!\!\!,
\end{equation*}

or through

\begin{equation*}
\SGM{T}\!\!\!\!\cdotp

Our statement about base states means that it is <em class="emph">possible</em> to
filter to some pure state, so that no further filtering by an
identical apparatus is possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We must also point out that what we are saying is exactly true only in
rather idealized situations. In any real Stern-Gerlach apparatus, we
would have to worry about diffraction by the slits that could cause
some atoms to go into states corresponding to different angles, or
about whether the beams might contain atoms with different excitations
of their internal states, and so on. We have idealized the situation
so that we are talking only about the states that are split in a
magnetic field; we are ignoring things having to do with position,
momentum, internal excitations, and the like. In general, one would
need to consider also base states which are sorted out with respect to
such things also. But to keep the concepts simple, we are considering
only our set of three states, which is sufficient for the exact
treatment of the idealized situation in which the atoms don’t get torn
up in going through the apparatus, or otherwise badly treated, and
come to rest when they leave the apparatus.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">You will note that we always begin our thought experiments by taking a
filter with only one channel open, so that we start with some definite
base state. We do this because atoms come out of a furnace in various
states determined at random by the accidental happenings inside the
furnace. (It gives what is called an “unpolarized” beam.) This
randomness involves probabilities of the “classical” kind—as in
coin tossing—which are different from the quantum mechanical
probabilities we are worrying about now. Dealing with an unpolarized
beam would get us into additional complications that are better to
avoid until after we understand the behavior of polarized beams. So
don’t try to consider at this point what happens if the <em class="emph">first</em>
apparatus lets more than one beam through. (We will tell you how you
can handle such cases at the end of the chapter.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s now go back and see what happens when we go from a base state
for one filter to a base state for a different filter. Suppose we
start again with
\begin{equation*}
\SGP{S} \!\! \SGZ{T}\!\!\!\!\cdotp
\end{equation*}

The atoms which come out of $T$ are in the base state $(\OT)$ and
have no memory that they were once in the state $(+S)$. Some people
would say that in the filtering by $T$ we have “lost the
information” about the previous state $(+S)$ because we have
“disturbed” the atoms when we separated them into three beams in the
apparatus $T$. But that is not true. The past information is not lost
by the <em class="emph">separation</em> into three beams, but by the <em class="emph">blocking
masks</em> that are put in—as we can see by the following set of
experiments.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S4-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">We start with a $+S$ filter and will call $N$ the number of atoms that
come through it. If we follow this by a $\OT$ filter, the number of
atoms that come out is some fraction of the original number,
say $\alpha N$. If we then put another $+S$ filter, only some
fraction $\beta$ of these atoms will get to the far end. We can indicate this
in the following way:

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:14}
\SGP{S}  
\kern{-12pt} \raise{7pt} {\overset{N}{\longrightarrow}}\!

If our third apparatus $S'$ selected a different state, say the
$(\OS)$ state, a different fraction, say $\gamma$, would get
through.<a name="footnote_source_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup class="mark">4</sup></a> We would have

\SGZ{S'} 
\kern{-12pt} \raise{7pt} {\overset{\gamma \alpha N}{\longrightarrow .}}
\end{equation}

Now suppose we repeat these two experiments but remove all the masks
from $T$. We would then find the remarkable results as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:16}
\SGP{S}  
\kern{-12pt} \raise{7pt} {\overset{N}{\longrightarrow}}\!
\SG{T}

<em class="emph">All</em> the atoms get through $S'$ in the first case, but
<em class="emph">none</em> in the second case! This is one of the great laws of
quantum mechanics. That nature works this way is not self-evident, but
the results we have given correspond for our idealized situation to
the quantum mechanical behavior observed in innumerable experiments.</p>

<em class="emph">fewer</em> atoms through? This is the old, deep mystery of quantum
mechanics—the interference of amplitudes. It’s the same kind of thing
we first saw in the two-slit interference experiment with electrons. We
saw that we could get fewer electrons at some places with both slits
open than we got with one slit open. It works quantitatively this way.
We can write the amplitude that an atom will get through $T$ and $S'$ in
the apparatus of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII517">5.17</a>) as the sum of three amplitudes, one
for each of the three beams in $T$; the sum is equal to zero:

None of the three individual amplitudes is zero—for example, the
absolute square of the second amplitude is $\gamma\alpha$,
see (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII515">5.15</a>)—but the <em class="emph">sum is zero</em>. We would have also
the same answer if $S'$ were set to select the $(-S)$ state. However, in
the setup of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII516">5.16</a>), the answer is different. If we call
$a$ the amplitude to get through $T$ and $S'$, in this case we

<p class="p">In the experiment (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII516">5.16</a>) the beam has been split and

as though the $T$ apparatus were not there at all. This is true
whatever is put after the “wide-open” $T$ apparatus. We could follow

disturbances on the three beams. For instance, it should not have a
strong electric field near one beam and not the others. The reason is
that even if this extra disturbance would still let all the atoms

in Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII518">5.18</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII519">5.19</a>) would be

</div>
<div id="Ch5-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s consider another illustration. Think of the following problem:
We start with an $S$ apparatus; then we have a complicated mess of
junk, which we can call $A$, and then an $R$ apparatus—like this:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:28}
\SGP{S} \!\! \APPARAT{A} \!\! \SGZ{R} \!\!\!\!\cdot

By $A$ we mean any complicated arrangement of Stern-Gerlach
apparatuses with masks or half-masks, oriented at peculiar angles,
with odd electric and magnetic fields … almost anything you
want to put. (It’s nice to do thought experiments—you don’t have to
go to all the trouble of actually <em class="emph">building</em> the apparatus!) The
problem then is: With what amplitude does a particle that enters the
section $A$ in a $(+S)$ state come out of $A$ in the $(\OR)$ state, so
that it will get through the last $R$ filter? There is a regular
notation for such an amplitude; it is
\begin{equation*}
\bracket{\OR}{A}{+S}.
\end{equation*}

As usual, it is to be read from right to left (like Hebrew):
\begin{equation*}
\bracket{\text{finish}}{\text{through}}{\text{start}}.
\end{equation*}

If by chance $A$ doesn’t do anything—but is just an open
channel—then we write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:29}
\bracket{\OR}{1}{+S}=\braket{\OR}{+S};

the two symbols are equivalent. For a more general problem, we might
replace $(+S)$ by a general starting state $\phi$ and $(\OR)$ by a
general finishing state $\chi$, and we would want to know the
amplitude

\bracket{\chi}{A}{\phi}.
\end{equation*}

A complete analysis of the apparatus $A$ would have to give the
amplitude $\bracket{\chi}{A}{\phi}$ for every possible pair of states
$\phi$ and $\chi$—an infinite number of combinations! How then can
we give a concise description of the behavior of the apparatus $A$? We
can do it in the following way. Imagine that the apparatus
of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII528">5.28</a>) is modified to be
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:30}
\SGP{S} \!\! \SG{T} \!\! \APPARAT{A} \!\! \SG{T} \!\! \SGZ{R} \!\!\!\!\cdotp
\end{equation}

This is really no modification at all since the wide-open
$T$ apparatuses don’t do anything. But they do suggest how we can analyze
the problem. There is a certain set of amplitudes $\braket{i}{+S}$
that the atoms from $S$ will get into the $i$ state of $T$. Then there
is another set of amplitudes that an $i$ state (with respect to $T$)
entering $A$ will come out as a $j$ state (with respect to $T$). And
finally there is an amplitude that each $j$ state will get through the
last filter as a $(\OR)$ state. For each possible alternative path,
there is an amplitude of the form
\begin{equation*}
\braket{\OR}{j}
\bracket{j}{A}{i}
\braket{i}{+S},
\end{equation*}

and the total amplitude is the sum of the terms we can get with all
possible combinations of $i$ and $j$. The amplitude we want is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:31}
\sum_{ij}
\braket{\OR}{j}
\bracket{j}{A}{i}
\braket{i}{+S}.
\end{equation}

If $(\OR)$ and $(+S)$ are replaced by general states $\chi$
and $\phi$, we would have the same kind of expression; so we have the
general result
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:32}
\bracket{\chi}{A}{\phi}=
\sum_{ij}
\braket{\chi}{j}
\bracket{j}{A}{i}
\braket{i}{\phi}.
\end{equation}

<p class="p">Now notice that the right-hand side of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII532">5.32</a>) is
really “simpler” than the left-hand side. The apparatus $A$ is
completely described by the <em class="emph">nine</em> numbers $\bracket{j}{A}{i}$
which tell the response of $A$ with respect to the three base states
of the apparatus $T$. Once we know these nine numbers, we can handle
any two incoming and outgoing states $\phi$ and $\chi$ if we define
each in terms of the three amplitudes for going into, or from, each of

<div id="Ch5-S6-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">The mathematics of quantum mechanics is just an extension of this
idea. We will give you a simple illustration. Suppose we have an
apparatus $C$ that we wish to analyze—that is, we want to calculate
the various $\bracket{j}{C}{i}$. For instance, we might want to know
what happens in an experiment like
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:34}
\SGP{S} \!\! \APPARAT{C} \!\! \SGZ{R} \!\!\!\!\cdotp
\end{equation}

But then we notice that $C$ is just built of two pieces of apparatus
$A$ and $B$ in series—the particles go through $A$ and then
through $B$—so we can write symbolically
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:35}
\APPARAT{C} \kern{-10pt} \raise{7pt}{=} \APPARAT{A} \kern{-12pt} \raise{7pt}{\cdot} \APPARAT{B} \!\!\!\!\cdotp
\end{equation}


We can call the $C$ apparatus the “product” of $A$ and $B$. Suppose
also that we already know how to analyze the two parts; so we can get
the matrices (with respect to $T$) of $A$ and $B$. Our problem is then
solved. We can easily find
\begin{equation*}
\bracket{\chi}{C}{\phi}
\end{equation*}

for any input and output states. First we write that
\begin{equation*}
\bracket{\chi}{C}{\phi}=\sum_k
\bracket{\chi}{B}{k}\bracket{k}{A}{\phi}.
\end{equation*}

Do you see why? (<em class="emph">Hint:</em> Imagine putting a $T$ apparatus between
$A$ and $B$.)  Then if we consider the special case in which $\phi$
and $\chi$ are also base states (of $T$), say $i$ and $j$, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:36}
\bracket{j}{C}{i}=\sum_k
\bracket{j}{B}{k}\bracket{k}{A}{i}.
\end{equation}

This equation gives the matrix for the “product” apparatus $C$ in
terms of the two matrices of the apparatuses $A$ and $B$.
Mathematicians call the new matrix $\bracket{j}{C}{i}$—formed
from two matrices $\bracket{j}{B}{i}$ and $\bracket{j}{A}{i}$
according to the sum specified in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII536">5.36</a>)—the
“product” matrix $BA$ of the two matrices $B$ and $A$. (Note that
the <em class="emph">order</em> is important, $AB\neq BA$.) Thus, we can say that the
matrix for a succession of two pieces of apparatus is the matrix
product of the matrices for the two apparatuses (putting the
<em class="emph">first</em> apparatus on the <em class="emph">right</em> in the product). Anyone who
knows matrix algebra
then understands that we mean just Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII536">5.36</a>).

<span class="tag">5–7</span>Transforming to a different base</h3>
<div id="Ch5-S7-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We want to make one final point about the base states used in the
calculations. Suppose we have chosen to work with some particular
base—say the $S$ base—and another fellow decides to do the same
calculations with a different base—say the $T$ base. To keep things
straight let’s call our base states the $(iS)$ states, where $i=+$,
$0$, $-$. Similarly, we can call his base states $(jT)$. How can we
compare our work with his? The final answers for the result of any
measurement should come out the same, but in the calculations the
various amplitudes and matrices used will be different. How are they
related?  For instance, if we both start with the same $\phi$, we will
describe it in terms of the three amplitudes $\braket{iS}{\phi}$ that
$\phi$ goes into our base states in the $S$ representation, whereas he
will describe it by the amplitudes $\braket{jT}{\phi}$ that the
state $\phi$ goes into the base states in his $T$ representation. How can we
check that we are really both describing the same state $\phi$? We can
do it with the general rule II in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII527">5.27</a>). Replacing
$\chi$ by any one of his states $jT$, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:5:37}
\braket{jT}{\phi}=\sum_i
\braket{jT}{iS}\braket{iS}{\phi}.
\end{equation}

To relate the two representations, we need only give the nine complex
numbers of the matrix $\braket{jT}{iS}$. This matrix can then be used
to convert all of our equations to his form. It tells us how to
<em class="emph">transform</em> from one set of base states to another. (For this
reason $\braket{jT}{iS}$ is sometimes called “the transformation
matrix from representation $S$ to representation $T$.” Big words!)</p>

algebra. Every vector can
be represented by giving three numbers—the components along the axes
$x$, $y$, and $z$. That is, every vector can be resolved into three
“base” vectors which are vectors along the three axes. But suppose
someone else chooses to use a different set of axes—$x'$, $y'$,
and $z'$. He will be using different numbers to represent any particular
vector. His calculations will look different, but the final results
will be the same. We have considered this before and know the rules

<p class="p">We began by pointing out that our discussion of spin-one particles

only three base states, any particular situation may involve $n$ base
states.<a name="footnote_source_8" href="#footnote_8"><sup class="mark">8</sup></a> Our basic laws in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII527">5.27</a>) have
exactly the same form—with the understanding that $i$ and $j$ must
range over all $n$ base states. Any phenomenon can be analyzed by
giving the amplitudes that it starts in each one of the base states
and ends in any other one of the base states, and then summing over
the complete set of base states. Any proper set of base states can be
used, and if someone wishes to use a different set, it is just as
good; the two can be connected by using an $n$ by $n$ transformation

<div id="Ch5-S8-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Finally, we promised to remark on what to do if atoms come directly
from a furnace, go through some apparatus, say $A$, and are then
analyzed by a filter which selects the state $\chi$. You do not know
what the state $\phi$ is that they start out in. It is perhaps best if
you don’t worry about this problem just yet, but instead concentrate
on problems that always start out with pure states. But if you insist,
here is how the problem can be handled.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S8-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">First, you have to be able to make some reasonable guess about the way
the states are distributed in the atoms that come from the
furnace. For example, if there were nothing “special” about the
furnace, you might reasonably guess that atoms would leave the furnace
with random “orientations.” Quantum mechanically, that corresponds
to saying that you don’t know anything about the states, but that
one-third are in the $(+S)$ state, one-third are in the
$(\OS)$ state, and one-third are in the $(-S)$ state. For those that are in
the $(+S)$ state the amplitude to get through
is $\bracket{\chi}{A}{+S}$ and the probability
is $\abs{\bracket{\chi}{A}{+S}}^2$, and similarly for the others. The
overall probability is then
\begin{equation*}
\tfrac{1}{3}\abs{\bracket{\chi}{A}{+S}}^2\!+\!
\tfrac{1}{3}\abs{\bracket{\chi}{A}{\OS}}^2\!+\!
\tfrac{1}{3}\abs{\bracket{\chi}{A}{-S}}^2\!.
\end{equation*}

Why did we use $S$ rather than, say, $T$? The answer is, surprisingly,
the same no matter what we choose for our initial resolution—so long
as we are dealing with completely random orientations. It comes about
in the same way that
\begin{equation*}
\sum_i\abs{\braket{\chi}{iS}}^2=
\sum_j\abs{\braket{\chi}{jT}}^2

for any $\chi$. (We leave it for you to prove.)</p>

certain interferences might be possible. It is simply that you do not
<em class="emph">know</em>, what the initial state is; you have to think in terms of
the probability that the system starts out in the various possible
initial states, and then you have to take a weighted average over the
