<p class="p">According to Newton
everything attracts everything else with a force inversely proportional
to the square of the distance from it, and objects respond to forces
with accelerations proportional to the forces. They are Newton’s
laws of universal gravitation and of
motion. As you know, they account for the motions of balls, planets,
satellites, galaxies, and so forth.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Einstein had a different
interpretation of the law of gravitation. According
to him, space and time—which must be put together as space-time—are
<em class="emph">curved</em> near heavy masses. And it is the attempt of things to go
along “straight lines” in this curved space-time which makes them move
the way they do. Now that is a complex idea—very complex. It is the
idea we want to explain in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Our subject has three parts. One involves the effects of gravitation.
Another involves the ideas of space-time which we already studied. The
third involves the idea of curved space-time. We will simplify our
subject in the beginning by not worrying about gravity and by leaving
out the time—discussing just curved space. We will talk later about
the other parts, but we will concentrate now on the idea of curved
space—what is meant by curved space, and, more specifically, what is
meant by curved space in this application of
Einstein. Now even that much
turns out to be somewhat difficult in three dimensions. So we will first
reduce the problem still further and talk about what is meant by the
words “curved space” in two dimensions.</p>

<div id="Ch42-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">In order to understand this idea of curved space in two dimensions you
really have to appreciate the limited point of view of the character who
lives in such a space. Suppose we imagine a bug with no eyes who lives
on a plane, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F1">42–1</a>. He can move only on the
plane, and he has no way of knowing that there is anyway to discover any
“outside world.” (He hasn’t got your imagination.) We are, of course,
going to argue by analogy. <em class="emph">We</em> live in a three-dimensional world,
and we don’t have any imagination about going off our three-dimensional
world in a new direction; so we have to think the thing out by analogy.
It is as though we were bugs living on a plane, and there was a space in
another direction. That’s why we will first work with the bug,
remembering that he must live on his surface and can’t get out.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch42-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">As another example of a bug living in two dimensions, let’s imagine one
who lives on a sphere. We imagine that he can walk around on the surface
of the sphere, as in Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F2">42–2</a> but that he can’t look
“up,” or “down,” or “out.”</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch42-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we want to consider still a <em class="emph">third</em> kind of creature. He is
also a bug like the others, and also lives on a plane, as our first bug
did, but this time the plane is peculiar. The temperature is different
at different places. Also, the bug and any rulers he uses are all made
of the same material which expands when it is heated. Whenever he puts a
ruler somewhere to measure something the ruler expands immediately to
the proper length for the temperature at that place. Wherever he puts
any object—himself, a ruler, a triangle, or anything—the thing
stretches itself because of the thermal expansion. Everything is longer
in the hot places than it is in the cold places, and everything has the
same coefficient of expansion. We will call the home of our third bug a
“hot plate,” although we will particularly want to think of a special
kind of hot plate that is cold in the center and gets hotter as we go
out toward the edges (Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F3">42–3</a>).</p>

<p class="p">Now we are going to imagine that our bugs begin to study geometry.
Although we imagine that they are blind so that they can’t see any
“outside” world, they can do a lot with their legs and feelers. They
can draw lines, and they can make rulers, and measure off lengths.
First, let’s suppose that they start with the simplest idea in geometry.
They learn how to make a straight line—defined as the shortest line
between two points. Our first bug—see Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F4">42–4</a>—learns
to make very good lines. But what happens to the bug on the sphere? He
draws his straight line as the shortest distance—<em class="emph">for
him</em>—between two points, as in Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F5">42–5</a>. It may look
like a curve to us, but he has no way of getting off the sphere and
finding out that there is “really” a shorter line. He just knows that
if he tries any other path <em class="emph">in his world</em> it is always longer than
his straight line. So we will let him have his straight line as the
shortest arc between two points. (It is, of course an arc of a great
circle.)</p>

<div id="Ch42-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Finally, our third bug—the one in Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F3">42–3</a>—will also
draw “straight lines” that look like curves to us. For instance, the
shortest distance between $A$ and $B$ in Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F6">42–6</a> would be
on a curve like the one shown. Why? Because when his line curves out
toward the warmer parts of his hot plate, the rulers get longer (from
our omniscient point of view) and it takes fewer “yardsticks” laid
end-to-end to get from $A$ to $B$. So <em class="emph">for him</em> the line is
straight—he has no way of knowing that there could be someone out in a
strange three-dimensional world who would call a different line
“straight.”</p>

<p class="p">We think you get the idea now that all the rest of the analysis will
always be from the point of view of the creatures on the particular
surfaces and not from <em class="emph">our</em> point of view. With that in mind let’s
see what the rest of their geometries looks like. Let’s assume that the
bugs have all learned how to make two lines intersect at right angles.
(You can figure out how they could do it.) Then our first bug (the one
on the normal plane) finds an interesting fact. If he starts at the
point $A$ and makes a line $100$ inches long, then makes a right angle
and marks off another $100$ inches, then makes another right angle and
goes another $100$ inches, then makes a third right angle and a fourth
line $100$ inches long, he ends up right at the starting point as shown
in Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F7">42–7</a>(a). It is a property of his world—one of the
facts of his “geometry.”</p>

<p class="p">Then he discovers another interesting thing. If he makes a triangle—a
figure with three straight lines—the sum of the angles is equal
to $180^\circ$, that is, to the sum of two right angles. See

<div id="Ch42-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">Then he invents the circle. What’s a circle? A circle is made this way:
You rush off on straight lines in many many directions from a single
point, and lay out a lot of dots that are all the same distance from
that point. See Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F7">42–7</a>(c). (We have to be careful how we
define these things because we’ve got to be able to make the analogs for
the other fellows.) Of course, its equivalent to the curve you can make
by swinging a ruler around a point. Anyway, our bug learns how to make
circles. Then one day he thinks of measuring the distance around a
circle. He measures several circles and finds a neat relationship: The
distance around is always the same number times the radius $r$ (which
is, of course, the distance from the center out to the curve). The
circumference and the radius always have the same
ratio—approximately $6.283$—independent of the size of the circle.</p>

gave above, he would probably think that the result was hardly worth the
trouble. He gets a figure like the one shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F8">42–8</a>.
His endpoint $B$ isn’t on top of the starting point $A$. It doesn’t work
out to a closed figure at all. Get a sphere and try it. A similar thing
would happen to our friend on the hot plate. If he lays out four
straight lines of equal length—as measured with his expanding
rulers—joined by right angles he gets a picture like the one in

that they had checked him out roughly by making crude measurements on a

that just by <em class="emph">geometrical measurements</em> they would discover that
something was the matter with their space. We define a <em class="emph">curved

plane. The geometry of the bugs on the sphere or on the hot plate is the
geometry of a curved space. The rules of Euclidean geometry fail. And it
isn’t necessary to be able to lift yourself out of the plane in order to
find out that the world that you live in is curved. It isn’t necessary
to circumnavigate the globe in order to find out that it is a ball. You
can find out that you live on a ball by laying out a square. If the
square is very small you will need a lot of accuracy, but if the square
is large the measurement can be done more crudely.</p>

<p class="p">Let’s take the case of a triangle on a plane. The sum of the angles is
$180$ degrees. Our friend on the sphere can find triangles that are very
peculiar. He can, for example, find triangles which have <em class="emph">three
right angles</em>. Yes indeed! One is shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F10">42–10</a>.
Suppose our bug starts at the north pole and makes a straight line all
the way down to the equator. Then he makes a right angle and another
perfect straight line the same length. Then he does it again. For the
very special length he has chosen he gets right back to his starting
point, and also meets the first line with a right angle. So there is no
doubt that for him this triangle has three right angles, or
$270$ degrees in the sum. It turns out that for him the sum of the
angles of the triangle is <em class="emph">always</em> greater than $180$ degrees. In
fact, the excess (for the special case shown, the extra $90$ degrees) is
proportional to how much area the triangle has. If a triangle on a
sphere is very small, its angles add up to very nearly $180$ degrees,
only a little bit over. As the triangle gets bigger the discrepancy goes
up. The bugs on the hot plate would discover similar difficulties with
their triangles.</p>

circles and measure their circumferences. For example, the bug on the

Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F11">42–11</a>. And he would discover that the circumference is
<em class="emph">less</em> than $2\pi$ times the radius. (You can see that because from
the wisdom of our three-dimensional view it is obvious that what he
calls the “radius” is a curve which is <em class="emph">longer</em> than the true
radius of the circle.) Suppose that the bug on the sphere had read
Euclid, and decided to predict a radius
by dividing the circumference $C$ by $2\pi$, taking
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:1}
r_{\text{pred}}=\frac{C}{2\pi}.
\end{equation}

Then he would find that the measured radius was larger than the
predicted radius. Pursuing the subject, he might define the difference
to be the “excess radius,” and write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:2}
r_{\text{meas}}-r_{\text{pred}}=r_{\text{excess}},

we would notice that his rulers are short near the center and get longer
as they are moved outward—although the bug doesn’t know it, of course.
When he measures the circumference the ruler is long all the time, so
he, too, finds out that the measured radius is longer than the predicted
radius, $C/2\pi$. The hot-plate bug also finds an “excess
radius effect.” And
again the size of the effect depends on the radius of the circle.

make the bug on the hot plate get exactly the same answers as the bug on
the ball. For those who like geometry and geometrical problems we’ll
tell you how it can be done. If you assume that the length of the rulers
(as determined by the temperature) goes in proportion to one plus some
constant times the square of the distance away from the origin, then you

sharper curvature in one place and a weaker curvature in the other
place, so that the excess in angles in triangles is more severe when he
makes little triangles in one part of his world than when he makes them
in another part. In other words, the curvature of a space can vary from
place to place. That’s just a generalization of the idea. It can also be
imitated by a suitable distribution of temperature on a hot plate.</p>

<em class="emph">less</em> than $180$ degrees. That may sound impossible, but it isn’t
at all. First of all, we could have a hot plate with the temperature
decreasing with the distance from the center. Then all the effects would
be reversed. But we can also do it purely geometrically by looking at
the two-dimensional geometry of the surface of a saddle. Imagine a
saddle-shaped surface like the one sketched in Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F13">42–13</a>.
Now draw a “circle” on the surface, defined as the locus of all points
the same distance from a center. This circle is a curve that oscillates
up and down with a scallop effect. So its circumference is larger than
you would expect from calculating $2\pi r_{\text{meas}}$. So $C/2\pi$ is
now <em class="emph">greater</em> than $r_{\text{meas}}$. The “excess
radius” would be
negative.

will look if the cylinder is unrolled onto a plane. Then all the
geometrical figures can be made to correspond exactly to the way they
are in a plane. So there is no way for a bug living on a cylinder
(assuming that he doesn’t go all the way around, but just makes local
measurements) to discover that his space is curved. In our technical
sense, then, we consider that his space is <em class="emph">not</em> curved. What we
want to talk about is more precisely called <em class="emph">intrinsic</em>
curvature; that is, a curvature which
can be found by measurements only in a local region. (A cylinder has no
intrinsic curvature.) This was the sense intended by
Einstein when he said that our

(Perhaps it’s just as well that we can’t imagine too much, so that we
don’t get too free of the real world.) But we can still <em class="emph">define</em> a

but we certainly can distinguish those cases from the flat space, the
ordinary plane. How? Easy enough: We lay out a triangle and measure the
angles. Or we make a great big circle and measure the circumference and
the radius. Or we try to lay out some accurate squares, or try to make a
cube. In each case we test whether the laws of geometry work. If they
don’t work, we say that our space is curved. If we lay out a big
triangle and the sum of its angles exceeds $180$ degrees, we can say our

some plane, we may get a different answer than if we orient the plane of
the triangle in a different way. Or take the example of a circle.
Suppose we draw a circle and measure the radius and it doesn’t check
with $C/2\pi$ so that there is some excess radius. Now we draw another circle at right
angles—as in Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F15">42–15</a>. There’s no need for the excess

positive excess for a circle in one plane, and a defect (negative

laying out a fine scale rectangular grid on the surface of the sphere
and adding up all the bits of area. According to Euclid the total
area $A$ is supposed to be $4\pi$ times the square of the radius; so we
can define a “predicted radius” as $\sqrt{A/4\pi}$. But we can also
measure the radius directly by digging a hole to the center and
measuring the distance. Again, we can take the measured radius minus the
predicted radius and call the difference the radius excess,
\begin{equation*}
r_{\text{excess}}=r_{\text{meas}}-\biggl(
\frac{\text{measured area}}{4\pi}\biggr)^{1/2},

is an average, however, it does not solve completely the problem of
defining the geometry. If you know only this number you can’t predict
all properties of the geometry of the space, because you can’t tell what
would happen with circles of different orientation. The complete
definition requires the specification of six “curvature numbers” at
each point. Of course the mathematicians know how to write all those
numbers. You can read someday in a mathematics book how to write them

density, which may vary, however, as much as you want from place to
place.<a name="footnote_source_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup class="mark">3</sup></a> The rule that
Einstein gave for the curvature

the mass inside the sphere. Using the definition of excess
radius, we have

\label{Eq:II:42:3}
\text{Radius excess}=
r_{\text{meas}}-\sqrt{\frac{A}{4\pi}}
=\frac{G}{3c^2}\cdot M.

Here, $G$ is the gravitational constant (of Newton’s theory), $c$ is the
velocity of light, and $M=4\pi\rho r^3/3$ is the mass of the matter
inside the sphere. This is Einstein’s law for the mean curvature of

area we could calculate the predicted radius we would get from setting
the area equal to $4\pi r^2$. When we compared the predicted radius with
the actual radius, we would find that the actual radius exceeded the
predicted radius by the amount given in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII423">42.3</a>). The
constant $G/3c^2$ is about $2.5\times10^{-29}$ cm per gram, so for each
gram of material the measured radius is off by $2.5\times10^{-29}$ cm.
Putting in the mass of the earth, which is about $6\times10^{27}$ grams,

For a circle in a plane there will be an excess radius of one sign for some orientations

the average over a sphere is zero when there is no mass <em class="emph">inside</em>

our three-dimensional space has a local curvature—a kind of
three-dimensional pimple.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">If we make a lot of bumps on a plane there might be an overall curvature
besides all the pimples—the surface might become like a ball. It would
be interesting to know whether our space has a net average curvature as
well as the local pimples due to the lumps of matter like the earth and
the sun. The astrophysicists have been trying to answer that question by
making measurements of galaxies at very large distances. For example, if
the number of galaxies we see in a spherical shell at a large distance
is different from what we would expect from our knowledge of the radius
of the shell, we would have a measure of the excess radius of a tremendously large sphere. From
such measurements it is hoped to find out whether our whole universe is
flat on the average, or round—whether it is “closed,” like a sphere,
or “open” like a plane. You may have heard about the debates that are
going on about this subject. There are debates because the astronomical
measurements are still completely inconclusive; the experimental data
are not precise enough to give a definite answer. Unfortunately, we
don’t have the slightest idea about the overall curvature of our
universe on a large scale.

<div id="Ch42-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we have to talk about time. As you know from the special theory of
relativity, measurements of space and measurements of time are
interrelated. And it would be kind of crazy to have something happening
to the space, without the time being involved in the same thing. You
will remember that the measurement of time depends on the speed at which
you move. For instance, if we watch a guy going by in a spaceship we see
that things happen more slowly for him than for us. Let’s say he takes
off on a trip and returns in $100$ seconds flat <em class="emph">by our watches</em>;
his watch might say that he had been gone for only $95$ seconds. In
comparison with ours, his watch—and all other processes, like his
heart beat—have been running slow.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let’s consider an interesting problem. Suppose you are the one in
the spaceship. We ask you to start off at a given signal and return to
your starting place just in time to catch a later signal—at, say,
exactly $100$ seconds later according to <em class="emph">our</em> clock. And you are
also asked to make the trip in such a way that <em class="emph">your</em> watch will
show the <em class="emph">longest possible</em> elapsed time. How should you move? You
should stand still. If you move at all your watch will read less than
$100$ sec when you get back.</p>

<div id="Ch42-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose, however, we change the problem a little. Suppose we ask you to
start at point $A$ on a given signal and go to point $B$ (both fixed
relative to us), and to do it in such a way that you arrive back just at
the time of a second signal (say $100$ seconds later according to our
fixed clock). Again you are asked to make the trip in the way that lets
you arrive with the latest possible reading on your watch. How would you
do it? For which path and schedule will <em class="emph">your</em> watch show the
greatest elapsed time when you arrive? The answer is that you will spend
the longest time from <em class="emph">your</em> point of view if you make the trip by
going at a uniform speed along a straight line. Reason: Any extra
motions and any extra-high speeds will make your clock go slower. (Since
the time deviations depend on the <em class="emph">square</em> of the velocity, what
you lose by going extra fast at one place you can never make up by going
extra slowly in another place.)</p>

<div id="Ch42-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">The point of all this is that we can use the idea to define “a straight

along a straight line”—is then that motion which takes a watch from
one place at one time to another place at another time in the way that
gives the longest time reading for the watch. This will be our

<span class="tag">42–5</span>Gravity and the principle of equivalence</h3>
<div id="Ch42-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we are ready to discuss the laws of gravitation.
Einstein was trying to generate
a theory of gravitation that would fit with the relativity theory that
he had developed earlier. He was struggling along until he latched onto
one important principle which guided him into getting the correct laws.
That principle is based on the idea that when a thing is falling freely
everything inside it seems weightless. For example, a satellite in orbit
is falling freely in the earth’s gravity, and an astronaut in it feels
weightless. This idea, when stated with greater precision, is called
<em class="emph">Einstein’s principle of
equivalence</em>. It depends on the fact that all objects fall with exactly
the same acceleration no matter what their mass, or what they are made
of. If we have a spaceship that is “coasting”—so it’s in a free
fall—and there is a man inside, then the laws governing the fall of
the man and the ship are the same. So if he puts himself in the middle
of the ship he will stay there. He doesn’t fall <em class="emph">with respect to
the ship</em>. That’s what we mean when we say he is “weightless.”</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now suppose you are in a rocket ship which is accelerating. Accelerating
with respect to what? Let’s just say that its engines are on and
generating a thrust so that it is not coasting in a free fall. Also
imagine that you are way out in empty space so that there are
practically no gravitational forces on the ship. If the ship is
accelerating with “$1$ g” you will be able to stand on the “floor”
and will feel your normal weight. Also if you let go of a ball, it will
“fall” toward the floor. Why? Because the ship is accelerating
“upward,” but the ball has no forces on it, so it will not accelerate;
it will get left behind. Inside the ship the ball will appear to have a
downward acceleration of “$1$ g.”</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let’s compare that with the situation in a spaceship sitting at rest
on the surface of the earth. <em class="emph">Everything is the same!</em> You would be
pressed toward the floor, a ball would fall with an acceleration of
$1$ g, and so on. In fact, how could you tell inside a space ship
whether you are sitting on the earth or are accelerating in free space?
According to Einstein’s
equivalence principle there is no way to tell if you only make
measurements of what happens to things inside!</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">To be strictly correct, that is true only for one point inside the ship.
The gravitational field of the earth is not precisely uniform, so a
freely falling ball has a slightly different acceleration at different
places—the direction changes and the magnitude changes. But if we
imagine a strictly uniform gravitational field, it is completely
imitated in every respect by a system with a constant acceleration. That
is the basis of the principle of equivalence.</p>

<div id="Ch42-S6-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we want to use the principle of equivalence for figuring out a
strange thing that happens in a gravitational field. We’ll show you
something that happens in a rocket ship which you probably wouldn’t have
expected to happen in a gravitational field. Suppose we put a clock at
the “head” of the rocket ship—that is, at the “front” end—and we
put another identical clock at the “tail,” as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F16">42–16</a>. Let’s call the two clocks $A$ and $B$. If we
compare these two clocks when the ship is accelerating, the clock at the
head seems to run fast relative to the one at the tail. To see that,
imagine that the front clock emits a flash of light each second, and
that you are sitting at the tail comparing the arrival of the light
flashes with the ticks of clock $B$. Let’s say that the rocket is in the
position $a$ of Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F17">42–17</a> when clock $A$ emits a flash,
and at the position $b$ when the flash arrives at clock $B$. Later on
the ship will be at position $c$ when the clock $A$ emits its next
flash, and at position $d$ when you see it arrive at clock $B$.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch42-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">The first flash travels the distance $L_1$ and the second flash travels
the shorter distance $L_2$. It is a shorter distance because the ship is
accelerating and has a higher speed at the time of the second flash. You
can see, then, that if the two flashes were emitted from clock $A$ one
second apart, they would arrive at clock $B$ with a separation somewhat
less than one second, since the second flash doesn’t spend as much time
on the way. The same thing will also happen for all the later flashes.
So if you were sitting in the tail you would conclude that clock $A$ was
running faster than clock $B$. If you were to do the same thing in
reverse—letting clock $B$ emit light and observing it at
clock $A$—you would conclude that $B$ was running <em class="emph">slower</em>
than $A$. Everything fits together and there is nothing mysterious about
it all.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">But now let’s think of the rocket ship at rest in the earth’s gravity.
<em class="emph">The same thing happens</em>. If you sit on the floor with one clock
and watch another one which is sitting on a high shelf, it will appear
to run faster than the one on the floor! You say, “But that is wrong.
The times should be the same. With no acceleration there’s no reason for
the clocks to appear to be out of step.” But they must if the principle
of equivalence is right. And Einstein insisted that the principle <em class="emph">was</em> right, and went
courageously and correctly ahead. He proposed that clocks at different
places in a gravitational field must appear to run at different speeds.
But if one always <em class="emph">appears</em> to be running at a different speed with
respect to the other, then so far as the first is concerned the other
<em class="emph">is</em> running at a different rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S6-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">But now you see we have the analog for clocks of the hot ruler we were
talking about earlier, when we had the bug on a hot plate. We imagined
that rulers and bugs and everything changed lengths in the same way at
various temperatures so they could never tell that their measuring
sticks were changing as they moved around on the hot plate. It’s the
same with clocks in a gravitational field. Every clock we put at a
higher level is seen to go faster. Heartbeats go faster, all processes
run faster.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S6-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">If they didn’t you would be able to tell the difference between a
gravitational field and an accelerating reference system. The idea that
time can vary from place to place is a difficult one, but it is the idea
Einstein used, and it is
correct—believe it or not.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S6-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Using the principle of equivalence we can figure out how much the speed
of a clock changes with height in a gravitational field. We just work
out the apparent discrepancy between the two clocks in the accelerating
rocket ship. The easiest way to do this is to use the result we found in
Chapter <a href="I_34.html">34</a> of Vol. I for the Doppler
effect. There, we found—see
Eq. (<a href="I_34.html#mjx-eqn-EqI3414">34.14</a>)—that if $v$ is the <em class="emph">relative</em> velocity
of a source and a receiver, the <em class="emph">received</em> frequency $\omega$ is
related to the <em class="emph">emitted</em> frequency $\omega_0$ by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:4}
\omega=\omega_0\,\frac{1+v/c}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}.
\end{equation}

Now if we think of the accelerating rocket ship in
Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F17">42–17</a> the emitter and receiver are moving with equal
velocities at any one instant. But in the time that it takes the light
signals to go from clock $A$ to clock $B$ the ship has accelerated. It
has, in fact, picked up the additional velocity $gt$, where $g$ is the
acceleration and $t$ is time it takes light to travel the distance $H$
from $A$ to $B$. This time is very nearly $H/c$. So when the signals
arrive at $B$, the ship has increased its velocity by $gH/c$. The
receiver always has this velocity <em class="emph">with respect to the emitter</em> at
the instant the signal left it. So this is the velocity we should use in
the Doppler shift formula, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII424">42.4</a>). Assuming that the
acceleration and the length of the ship are small enough that this
velocity is much smaller than $c$, we can neglect the term in $v^2/c^2$.
We have that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:5}
\omega=\omega_0\biggl(1+\frac{gH}{c^2}\biggr).
\end{equation}

So for the two clocks in the spaceship we have the relation

</div>
<div id="Ch42-S6-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">This is such an important idea we would like to demonstrate that it also
follows from another law of physics—from the conservation of energy.
We know that the gravitational force on an object is proportional to its
mass $M$, which is related to its total internal energy $E$
by $M=E/c^2$. For instance, the masses of nuclei determined from the
<em class="emph">energies</em> of nuclear reactions which transmute one nucleus into
another agree with the masses obtained from atomic <em class="emph">weights</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S6-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Now think of an atom which has a lowest energy state of total
energy $E_0$ and a higher energy state $E_1$, and which can go from the
state $E_1$ to the state $E_0$ by emitting light. The frequency $\omega$
of the light will be given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:7}
\hbar\omega=E_1-E_0.
\end{equation}

</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S6-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Now suppose we have such an atom in the state $E_1$ sitting on the
floor, and we carry it from the floor to the height $H$. To do that we
must do some work in carrying the mass $m_1=E_1/c^2$ up against the
gravitational force. The amount of work done is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:8}
\frac{E_1}{c^2}\,gH.
\end{equation}

Then we let the atom emit a photon and go into the lower energy
state $E_0$. Afterward we carry the atom back to the floor. On the
return trip the mass is $E_0/c^2$; we get back the energy
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:9}
\frac{E_0}{c^2}\,gH,
\end{equation}

so we have done a net amount of work equal to
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:10}
\Delta U=\frac{E_1-E_0}{c^2}\,gH.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch42-S6-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">When the atom emitted the photon it gave up the energy $E_1-E_0$. Now
suppose that the photon happened to go down to the floor and be
absorbed. How much energy would it deliver there? You might at first
think that it would deliver just the energy $E_1-E_0$. But that can’t be
right if energy is conserved, as you can see from the following
argument. We started with the energy $E_1$ at the floor. When we finish,
the energy at the floor level is the energy $E_0$ of the atom in its
lower state plus the energy $E_{\text{ph}}$ received from the photon. In
the meantime we have had to supply the additional energy $\Delta U$ of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4210">42.10</a>). If energy is conserved, the energy we end up
with at the floor must be greater than we started with by just the work
we have done. Namely, we must have that
\begin{equation*}
E_{\text{ph}}+E_0=E_1+\Delta U,
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:11}
E_{\text{ph}}=(E_1-E_0)+\Delta U.
\end{equation}

It must be that the photon does <em class="emph">not</em> arrive at the floor with just
the energy $E_1-E_0$ it started with, but with a <em class="emph">little more
energy</em>. Otherwise some energy would have been lost. If we substitute in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4211">42.11</a>) the $\Delta U$ we got in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4210">42.10</a>)
we get that the photon arrives at the floor with the energy
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:12}
E_{\text{ph}}=(E_1-E_0)\biggl(1+\frac{gH}{c^2}\biggr).
\end{equation}

But a photon of energy $E_{\text{ph}}$ has the
frequency $\omega=E_{\text{ph}}/\hbar$. Calling the frequency of the
<em class="emph">emitted</em> photon $\omega_0$—which is by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII427">42.7</a>)
equal to $(E_1-E_0)/\hbar$—our result in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4212">42.12</a>) gives
again the relation of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII425">42.5</a>) between the frequency of the
photon when it is absorbed on the floor and the frequency with which it
was emitted.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S6-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">The same result can be obtained in still another way. A photon of
frequency $\omega_0$ has the energy $E_0=\hbar\omega_0$. Since the
energy $E_0$ has the relativistic mass $E_0/c^2$ the photon has a mass
(<em class="emph">not</em> rest mass) $\hbar\omega_0/c^2$, and is “attracted” by the
earth. In falling the distance $H$ it will gain an additional
energy $(\hbar\omega_0/c^2)gH$, so it arrives with the energy
\begin{equation*}
E=\hbar\omega_0\biggl(1+\frac{gH}{c^2}\biggr).
\end{equation*}

But its frequency after the fall is $E/\hbar$, giving again the result
in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII425">42.5</a>). Our ideas about relativity, quantum physics,
and energy conservation all fit together only if
Einstein’s predictions about
clocks in a gravitational field are right. The frequency changes we are
talking about are normally very small. For instance, for an altitude
difference of $20$ meters at the earth’s surface the frequency
difference is only about two parts in $10^{15}$. However, just such a
change has recently been found experimentally using the Mössbauer
effect.<a name="footnote_source_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup class="mark">5</sup></a> Einstein was perfectly correct.</p>

of curved space-time. We have already pointed out that if the time goes
at different rates in different places, it is analogous to the curved
space of the hot plate. But it is more than an analogy; it means that
space-time <em class="emph">is</em> curved. Let’s try to do some geometry in
space-time. That may at first sound peculiar, but we have often made
diagrams of space-time with distance plotted along one axis and time
along the other. Suppose we try to make a rectangle in space-time. We
begin by plotting a graph of height $H$ versus $t$ as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F18">42–18</a>(a). To make the base of our rectangle we take an
object which is <em class="emph">at rest</em> at the height $H_1$ and follow its world
line for $100$ seconds. We get the line $BD$ in part (b) of the figure
which is parallel to the $t$-axis. Now let’s take another object which
is $100$ feet above the first one at $t=0$. It starts at the point $A$
in Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F18">42–18</a>(c). Now we follow its world line for
$100$ seconds as measured by a clock at $A$. The object goes from $A$
to $C$, as shown in part (d) of the figure. But notice that since time
goes at a different rate at the two heights—we are assuming that there
is a gravitational field—the two points $C$ and $D$ are not
simultaneous. If we try to complete the square by drawing a line to the
point $C'$ which is $100$ feet above $D$ at the same time, as in

<p class="p">Let’s consider an interesting little puzzle. We have two identical
clocks, $A$ and $B$, sitting together on the surface of the earth as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F19">42–19</a>. Now we lift clock $A$ to some height $H$, hold
it there awhile, and return it to the ground so that it arrives at just
the instant when clock $B$ has advanced by $100$ seconds. Then clock $A$
will read something like $107$ seconds, because it was running faster
when it was up in the air. Now here is the puzzle. How should we move
clock $A$ so that it reads the latest possible time—always assuming
that it returns when $B$ reads $100$ seconds? You say, “That’s easy.
Just take $A$ as high as you can. Then it will run as fast as possible,
and be the latest when you return.” Wrong. You forgot something—we’ve
only got $100$ seconds to go up and back. If we go very high, we have to
go very fast to get there and back in $100$ seconds. And you mustn’t
forget the effect of special relativity which causes moving clocks to
<em class="emph">slow down</em> by the factor $\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$. This relativity
effect works in the direction of making clock $A$ read <em class="emph">less time</em>
than clock $B$. You see that we have a kind of game. If we stand still
with clock $A$ we get $100$ seconds. If we go up slowly to a small
height and come down slowly we can get a little more than $100$ seconds.
If we go a little higher, maybe we can gain a little more. But if we go
too high we have to move fast to get there, and we may slow down the
clock enough that we end up with less than $100$ seconds. What program
of height versus time—how high to go and with what speed to get there,
carefully adjusted to bring us back to clock $B$ when it has increased
by $100$ seconds—will give us the largest possible time reading on
clock $A$?</p>

motion—rising fast, slowing down, stopping, and coming back down—is
exactly the right motion to make the time the maximum on a wrist watch
strapped to the ball.</p>

<div id="Ch42-S8-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Now consider a slightly different game. We have two points $A$ and $B$
both on the earth’s surface at some distance from one another. We play
the same game that we did earlier to find what we call the straight
line. We ask how we should go from $A$ to $B$ so that the time on our
moving watch will be the longest—assuming we start at $A$ on a given
signal and arrive at $B$ on another signal at $B$ which we will say is
$100$ seconds later by a fixed clock. Now you say, “Well we found out
before that the thing to do is to coast along a straight line at a
uniform speed chosen so that we arrive at $B$ exactly $100$ seconds
later. If we don’t go along a straight line it takes more speed, and our
watch is slowed down.” But wait! That was before we took gravity into
account. Isn’t it better to curve upward a little bit and then come
down? Then during part of the time we are higher up and our watch will
run a little faster? It is, indeed. If you solve the mathematical
problem of adjusting the curve of the motion so that the elapsed time of
the moving watch is the most it can possibly be, you will find that the
motion is a parabola—the same curve followed by something that moves
on a free ballistic path in the gravitational field, as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch42-F19">42–19</a>. Therefore the law of motion in a gravitational
field can also be stated: <em class="emph">An object always moves from one place to
another so that a clock carried on it gives a longer time than it would
on any other possible trajectory</em>—with, of course, the same starting
and finishing conditions. The time measured by a moving clock is often
called its “proper time.” In free fall, the trajectory makes the
proper time of an object a maximum.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S8-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s see how this all works out. We begin with Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII425">42.5</a>)
which says that the <em class="emph">excess</em> rate of the moving watch is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:13}
\frac{\omega_0gH}{c^2}.
\end{equation}

Besides this, we have to remember that there is a correction of the
opposite sign for the speed. For this effect we know that
\begin{equation*}
\omega=\omega_0\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}.
\end{equation*}

Although the principle is valid for any speed, we take an example in
which the speeds are always much less than $c$. Then we can write this
equation as
\begin{equation*}
\omega=\omega_0(1-v^2/2c^2),
\end{equation*}

and the defect in the rate of our clock is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:14}
-\omega_0\,\frac{v^2}{2c^2}.
\end{equation}

Combining the two terms in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4213">42.13</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4214">42.14</a>)
we have that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:15}
\Delta\omega=\frac{\omega_0}{c^2}\biggl(gH-\frac{v^2}{2}\biggr).
\end{equation}

Such a frequency shift of our moving clock means that if we measure a
time $dt$ on a fixed clock, the moving clock will register the time
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:16}
dt\biggl[
1+\biggl(\frac{gH}{c^2}-\frac{v^2}{2c^2}\biggr)
\biggr],
\end{equation}

The total time excess over the trajectory is the integral of the extra
term with respect to time, namely
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:17}
\frac{1}{c^2}\int\biggl(gH-\frac{v^2}{2}\biggr)\,dt,
\end{equation}

which is supposed to be a maximum.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S8-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">The term $gH$ is just the gravitational potential $\phi$. Suppose we
multiply the whole thing by a constant factor $-mc^2$, where $m$ is the
mass of the object. The constant won’t change the condition for the
maximum, but the minus sign will just change the maximum to a minimum.
Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4216">42.16</a>) then says that the object will move so that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:42:18}
\int\biggl(\frac{mv^2}{2}-m\phi\biggr)\,dt=
\text{a minimum}.
\end{equation}

But now the integrand is just the difference of the kinetic and
potential energies. And if you look in Chapter <a href="II_19.html">19</a> of
Volume II you will see that when we discussed the principle of least
action we showed that Newton’s laws
for an object in any potential could be written exactly in the form of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4218">42.18</a>).

<div id="Ch42-S9-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Einstein’s form of the
equations of motion—that the proper time should be a maximum in curved
space-time—gives the same results as Newton’s laws for low velocities.
As he was circling around the earth, Gordon Cooper’s watch was reading
later than it would have in any other path you could have imagined for
his satellite.<a name="footnote_source_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup class="mark">6</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S9-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">So the law of gravitation can be stated in terms of the ideas of the
geometry of space-time in this remarkable way. The particles always take
the longest proper time—in space-time a quantity analogous to the
“shortest distance.” That’s the law of motion in a gravitational
field. The great advantage of putting it this way is that the law
doesn’t depend on any coordinates, or any other way of defining the
situation.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S9-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let’s summarize what we have done. We have given you two laws for
gravity:</p>


<ol id="Ch42-I1" class="enumerate">
<li id="Ch42-I1.i1" class="item">
How the geometry of space-time changes when matter is
present—namely, that the curvature expressed in terms of the excess
radius is proportional
to the mass inside a sphere, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII423">42.3</a>).
</li>
<li id="Ch42-I1.i2" class="item">
How objects move if there are only gravitational
forces—namely, that objects move so that their proper time between two
end conditions is a maximum.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those two laws correspond to similar pairs of laws we have seen earlier.
We originally described motion in a gravitational field in terms of
Newton’s inverse square law of gravitation and his laws of motion. Now
laws (1) and (2) take their places. Our new pair of laws also correspond
to what we have seen in electrodynamics. There we had our law—the set
of Maxwell’s equations—which
determines the fields produced by charges. It tells how the character of
“space” is changed by the presence of charged matter, which is what
law (1) does for gravity. In addition, we had a law about how particles
move in the given fields—$d(m\FLPv)/dt=q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB)$.
This, for gravity, is done by law (2).
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S9-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">In the laws (1) and (2) you have a precise statement of
Einstein’s theory of
gravitation—although you will usually find it stated in a more
complicated mathematical form. We should, however, make one further
addition. Just as time scales change from place to place in a
gravitational field, so do also the length scales. Rulers change lengths
as you move around. It is impossible with space and time so intimately
mixed to have something happen with time that isn’t in some way
reflected in space. Take even the simplest example: You are riding past
the earth. What is “<em class="emph">time</em>” from <em class="emph">your</em> point of view is
partly space from <em class="emph">our</em> point of view. So there must also be
changes in space. It is the entire <em class="emph">space-time</em> which is distorted
by the presence of matter, and this is more complicated than a change
only in time scale. However, the rule that we gave in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII423">42.3</a>) is enough to determine completely all the laws of
gravitation, provided that it is understood that this rule about the
curvature of space applies not only from one man’s point of view but is
true for everybody. Somebody riding by a mass of material sees a
different mass content because of the kinetic energy he calculates for
its motion past him, and he must include the mass corresponding to that
energy. The theory must be arranged so that everybody—no matter how he
moves—will, when he draws a sphere, find that the excess
radius is
$G/3c^2$ times the total mass (or, better, $G/3c^4$ times the total
energy content) inside the sphere. That this law—law (1)—should be
true in any moving system is one of the great laws of gravitation,
called <em class="emph">Einstein’s field
equation</em>. The other great law is (2)—that things must move so
that the proper time is a maximum—and is called
<em class="emph">Einstein’s equation of
motion</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S9-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">To write these laws in a complete algebraic form, to compare them with
Newton’s laws, or to relate them to electrodynamics is difficult
mathematically. But it is the way our most complete laws of the physics
of gravity look today.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S9-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Although they gave a result in agreement with Newton’s mechanics for the
simple example we considered, they do not always do so. The three
discrepancies first derived by Einstein have been experimentally confirmed: The orbit of Mercury
is not a fixed ellipse; starlight passing near the sun is deflected
twice as much as you would think; and the rates of clocks depend on
their location in a gravitational field. Whenever the predictions of
Einstein have been found to
differ from the ideas of Newtonian mechanics Nature has chosen
Einstein’s.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch42-S9-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s summarize everything that we have said in the following way.
First, time and distance rates depend on the place in space you measure
them and on the time. This is equivalent to the statement that
space-time is curved. From the measured area of a sphere we can define a
predicted radius, $\sqrt{A/4\pi}$, but the actual measured radius will
have an excess over this which is proportional (the constant is $G/c^2$)
to the total mass contained inside the sphere. This fixes the exact
degree of the curvature of space-time. And the curvature must be the
same no matter who is looking at the matter or how it is moving. Second,
particles move on “straight lines” (trajectories of maximum proper
time) in this curved space-time. This is the content of
Einstein’s formulation of the
laws of gravitation.</p>

  We
should mention one additional point for completeness. If you want to
carry the hot-plate model of curved space over into three dimensions you
must imagine that the length of the ruler depends not only on where you
put it, but also on which orientation the ruler has when it is laid
down. It is a generalization of the simple case in which the length of
the ruler depends on where it is, but is the same if set north-south, or
east-west, or up-down. This generalization is needed if you want to
represent a three-dimensional space with any arbitrary geometry with
such a model, although it happens not to be necessary for two
dimensions.

  Strictly speaking it is only a <em class="emph">local</em>
maximum. We should have said that the proper time is larger than for any
<em class="emph">nearby</em> path. For example, the proper time on an elliptical orbit
around the earth need not be longer than on a ballistic path of an
object which is shot to a great height and falls back down.
