<div id="Ch18-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In this chapter we come back to the complete set of the four
Maxwell equations that we took as our starting point in
Chapter <a href="II_01.html">1</a>. Until now, we have been studying Maxwell’s
equations in bits and pieces; it is time to add one final piece, and to
put them all together. We will then have the complete and correct story
for electromagnetic fields that may be changing with time in any way.
Anything said in this chapter that contradicts something said earlier is
true and what was said earlier is false—because what was said earlier
applied to such special situations as, for instance, steady currents or
fixed charges. Although we have been very careful to point out the
restrictions whenever we wrote an equation, it is easy to forget all of
the qualifications and to learn too well the wrong equations. Now we are
ready to give the whole truth, with no qualifications (or almost none).</p>

<div id="Ch18-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">The complete Maxwell equations are written in Table <a href="#Ch18-T1">18–1</a>,
in words as well as in mathematical symbols. The fact that the words
are equivalent to the equations should by this time be familiar—you
should be able to translate back and forth from one form to the other.</p>

<div id="Ch18-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The first equation—that the divergence of $\FLPE$ is the charge
density over $\epsO$—is true in general. In dynamic as well as in
static fields, Gauss’ law is always valid. The flux of $\FLPE$ through
any closed surface is proportional to the charge inside. The third
equation is the corresponding general law for magnetic fields. Since
there are no magnetic charges, the flux of $\FLPB$ through any closed
surface is always zero. The second equation, that the curl of $\FLPE$
is $-\ddpl{\FLPB}{t}$, is Faraday’s law and was discussed in
the last two chapters. It also is generally true. The last equation has
something new. We have seen before only the part of it which holds for
steady currents. In that case we said that the curl of $\FLPB$ is
$\FLPj/\epsO c^2$, but the correct general equation has a new part that
was discovered by Maxwell.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Until Maxwell’s work,
the known laws of electricity and magnetism were
those we have studied in Chapters <a href="II_03.html">3</a>
through <a href="II_17.html">17</a>. In particular, the equation for the magnetic
field of steady currents was known only as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:1}
\FLPcurl{\FLPB}=\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO c^2}.
\end{equation}

Maxwell began by
considering these known laws and expressing them as
differential equations, as we have done here. (Although the
$\FLPnabla$ notation was not yet invented, it is mainly due to
Maxwell
that the importance of the combinations of derivatives, which we today
call the curl and the divergence, first became apparent.) He then
noticed that there was something strange about Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII181">18.1</a>).
If one takes the divergence of this equation, the left-hand side will be
zero, because the divergence of a curl is always zero. So this equation
requires that the divergence of $\FLPj$ also be zero. But if the
divergence of $\FLPj$ is zero, then the total flux of current out of any
closed surface is also zero.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">The flux of current from a closed surface is the decrease of the
charge inside the surface. This certainly cannot in general be zero
because we know that the charges can be moved from one place to
another. The equation
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:2}
\FLPdiv{\FLPj}=-\ddp{\rho}{t}
\end{equation}

has, in fact, been almost our definition of $\FLPj$. This equation
expresses the very fundamental law that electric charge is
conserved—any flow of charge must come from some supply.
Maxwell
appreciated this difficulty and proposed that it could be avoided by
adding the term $\ddpl{\FLPE}{t}$ to the right-hand side of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII181">18.1</a>); he then got the fourth equation in
Table <a href="#Ch18-T1">18–1</a>:
\begin{equation*}
\text{IV.}\quad c^2\FLPcurl{\FLPB}=\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO}+\ddp{\FLPE}{t}.
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">It was not yet customary in
Maxwell’s time to think in terms of
abstract fields. Maxwell
discussed his ideas in terms of a model in
which the vacuum was like an elastic solid. He also tried to explain
the meaning of his new equation in terms of the mechanical
model. There was much reluctance to accept his theory, first because
of the model, and second because there was at first no experimental
justification. Today, we understand better that what counts are the
equations themselves and not the model used to get them. We may only
question whether the equations are true or false. This is answered by
doing experiments, and untold numbers of experiments have confirmed
Maxwell’s equations. If we take away the scaffolding he used to build
it, we find that Maxwell’s
beautiful edifice stands on its own. He
brought together all of the laws of electricity and magnetism and made
one complete and beautiful theory.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Let us show that the extra term is just what is required to straighten
out the difficulty Maxwell
discovered. Taking the divergence of his
equation (IV in Table <a href="#Ch18-T1">18–1</a>), we must have that the
divergence of the right-hand side is zero:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:3}
\FLPdiv{\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO}}+\FLPdiv{\ddp{\FLPE}{t}}=0.
\end{equation}

In the second term, the order of the derivatives with respect to
coordinates and time can be reversed, so the equation can be rewritten
as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:4}
\FLPdiv{\FLPj}+\epsO\,\ddp{}{t}\,\FLPdiv{\FLPE}=0.
\end{equation}

But the first of Maxwell’s equations says that the divergence of $\FLPE$
is $\rho/\epsO$. Inserting this equality in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII184">18.4</a>), we get back Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII182">18.2</a>), which we
know is true. Conversely, if we accept Maxwell’s equations—and we do
because no one has ever found an experiment that disagrees with
them—we must conclude that charge is always conserved.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">The laws of physics have no answer to the question: “What happens if
a charge is suddenly created at this point—what electromagnetic
effects are produced?” No answer can be given because our equations
say it doesn’t happen. If it <em class="emph">were</em> to happen, we would need new
laws, but we cannot say what they would be. We have not had the chance
to observe how a world without charge conservation behaves. According
to our equations, if you suddenly place a charge at some point, you
had to carry it there from somewhere else. In that case, we can say
what would happen.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">When we added a new term to the equation for the curl of $\FLPE$, we
found that a whole new class of phenomena was described. We shall see

little addition to the equation for $\FLPcurl{\FLPB}$
also has far-reaching consequences. We can touch on only a few of them
in this chapter.</p>

<div id="Ch18-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">As our first example we consider what happens with a spherically
symmetric radial distribution of current. Suppose we imagine a little
sphere with radioactive material on it. This radioactive material is
squirting out some charged particles. (Or we could imagine a large
block of jello with a small hole in the center into which some charge
had been injected with a hypodermic needle and from which the charge
is slowly leaking out.) In either case we would have a current that is
everywhere radially outward. We will assume that it has the same
magnitude in all directions.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Let the total charge inside any radius $r$ be $Q(r)$. If the radial
current density at the same radius is $\FLPj(r)$, then
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII182">18.2</a>) requires that $Q$ decreases at the rate
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:5}
\ddp{Q(r)}{t}=-4\pi r^2j(r).
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We now ask about the magnetic field produced by the currents in this
situation. Suppose we draw some loop $\Gamma$ on a sphere of radius $r$,
as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch18-F1">18–1</a>. There is some current
through this loop, so we might expect to find a magnetic field
circulating in the direction shown.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch18-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">But we are already in difficulty. How can the $\FLPB$ have any
particular direction on the sphere? A different choice of $\Gamma$
would allow us to conclude that its direction is exactly opposite to
that shown. So how <em class="emph">can</em> there be any circulation of $\FLPB$
around the currents?</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We are saved by Maxwell’s equation. The circulation of $\FLPB$ depends
not only on the total <em class="emph">current</em> through $\Gamma$ but also on the
rate of change with time of the <em class="emph">electric flux</em> through it. It
must be that these two parts just cancel. Let’s see if that works out.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">The electric field at the radius $r$ must be $Q(r)/4\pi\epsO r^2$—so
long as the charge is symmetrically distributed, as we assume. It is
radial, and its rate of change is then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:6}
\ddp{E}{t}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO r^2}\,\ddp{Q}{t}.
\end{equation}

Comparing this with Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII185">18.5</a>), we see
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:7}
\ddp{E}{t}=-\frac{j}{\epsO}.
\end{equation}

In Eq. IV the two source terms cancel and the curl of $\FLPB$ is
always zero. There is no magnetic field in our example.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">As our second example, we consider the magnetic field of a wire used to
charge a parallel-plate condenser (see Fig. <a href="#Ch18-F2">18–2</a>). If the
charge $Q$ on the plates is changing with time (but not too fast), the
current in the wires is equal to $dQ/dt$. We would expect that this
current will produce a magnetic field that encircles the wire. Surely,
the current close to the plate must produce the normal magnetic
field—it cannot depend on where the current is going.</p>

<p class="p">Suppose we take a loop $\Gamma_1$ which is a circle with radius $r$,
as shown in part (a) of the figure. The line integral of the magnetic
field should be equal to the current $I$ divided by $\epsO c^2$. We
have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:8}
2\pi rB=\frac{I}{\epsO c^2}.
\end{equation}

This is what we would get for a steady current, but it is also correct
with Maxwell’s
addition, because if we consider the plane surface $S$
inside the circle, there are no electric fields on it (assuming the
wire to be a very good conductor). The surface integral
of $\ddpl{\FLPE}{t}$ is zero.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S2-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose, however, that we now slowly move the curve $\Gamma$ downward.
We get always the same result until we draw even with the plates of the
condenser. Then the current $I$ goes to zero. Does the magnetic field
disappear? That would be quite strange. Let’s see what Maxwell’s
equation says for the curve $\Gamma_2$, which is a circle of radius $r$
whose plane passes between the condenser plates
[Fig. <a href="#Ch18-F2">18–2</a>(b)]. The line integral of $\FLPB$
around $\Gamma_2$ is $2\pi rB$. This must equal the time derivative of the flux
of $\FLPE$ through the plane circular surface $S_2$. This flux
of $\FLPE$, we know from Gauss’ law, must be equal to $1/\epsO$ times the
charge $Q$ on one of the condenser plates. We have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:9}
c^2\,2\pi rB=\ddt{}{t}\biggl(\frac{Q}{\epsO}\biggr).
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S2-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">That is very convenient. It is the same result we found in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII188">18.8</a>). Integrating over the changing electric field
gives the same magnetic field as does integrating over the current in
the wire. Of course, that is just what Maxwell’s equation says. It is
easy to see that this must always be so by applying our same arguments
to the two surfaces $S_1$ and $S_1'$ that are bounded by the same
circle $\Gamma_1$ in Fig. <a href="#Ch18-F2">18–2</a>(b). Through $S_1$ there is the
current $I$, but no electric flux. Through $S_1'$ there is no current,
but an electric flux changing at the rate $I/\epsO$. The same $\FLPB$ is
obtained if we use Eq. IV with either surface.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S2-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">From our discussion so far of
Maxwell’s new term, you may have the
impression that it doesn’t add much—that it just fixes up the
equations to agree with what we already expect. It is true that if we
just consider Eq. IV <em class="emph">by itself</em>, nothing particularly new

all-important. Maxwell’s
small change in Eq. IV, when <em class="emph">combined
with the other</em> equations, does indeed produce much that is new and
important. Before we take up these matters, however, we want to speak
more about Table <a href="#Ch18-T1">18–1</a>.</p>

<div id="Ch18-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">First we have the Maxwell equations—written in both the expanded
form and the short mathematical form. Then there is the conservation
of charge, which is even written in parentheses, because the moment we
have the complete Maxwell equations, we can deduce from them the
conservation of charge. So the table is even a little redundant. Next,
we have written the force law, because having all the electric and
magnetic fields doesn’t tell us anything until we know what they do to
charges. Knowing $\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$, however, we can find the force
on an object with the charge $q$ moving with velocity $\FLPv$.
Finally, having the force doesn’t tell us anything until we
know what happens when a force pushes on something; we need the law of
motion, which is that the force is equal to the rate of change of the
momentum. (Remember?  We had that in Volume I.) We even include
relativity effects by writing the momentum as $\FLPp=m_0\FLPv/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$.</p>

<p class="p">Now for the new consequences. They come from putting together all of
Maxwell’s equations. First, let’s see what would happen in a
circumstance which we pick to be particularly simple. By assuming that
all the quantities vary only in one coordinate, we will have a
one-dimensional problem. The situation is shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch18-F3">18–3</a>. We have a sheet of charge located on the
$yz$-plane. The sheet is first at rest, then instantaneously given a
velocity $u$ in the $y$-direction, and kept moving with this constant
velocity. You might worry about having such an “infinite”
acceleration, but it doesn’t really matter; just imagine that the
velocity is brought to $u$ very quickly. So we have suddenly a surface
current $J$ ($J$ is the current per unit width in the $z$-direction). To
keep the problem simple, we suppose that there is also a stationary
sheet of charge of opposite sign superposed on the $yz$-plane, so that
there are no electrostatic effects. Also, although in the figure we show
only what is happening in a finite region, we imagine that the sheet
extends to infinity in $\pm y$ and $\pm z$. In other words, we have a
situation where there is no current, and then suddenly there is a
uniform sheet of current. What will happen?</p>

<div id="Ch18-F3" class="figure">

<span class="tag">Fig. 18–3.</span>An infinite sheet of charge is suddenly set into motion
parallel to itself. There are magnetic and electric fields that
propagate out from the sheet at a constant speed.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Well, when there is a sheet of current in the plus $y$-direction,
there is, as we know, a magnetic field generated which will be in the
minus $z$-direction for $x&gt;0$ and in the opposite direction for
$x&lt;0$. We could find the magnitude of $\FLPB$ by using the fact that
the line integral of the magnetic field will be equal to the current
over $\epsO c^2$. We would get that $B=J/2\epsO c^2$ (since the
current $I$ in a strip of width $w$ is $Jw$ and the line integral
of $\FLPB$ is $2Bw$).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">This gives us the field next to the sheet—for small $x$—but since
we are imagining an infinite sheet, we would expect the same argument
to give the magnetic field farther out for larger values of $x$.
However, that would mean that the moment we turn on the current,
the magnetic field is suddenly changed from zero to a finite value
everywhere. But wait!  If the magnetic field is suddenly changed, it
will produce tremendous electrical effects. (If it changes in
<em class="emph">any</em> way, there are electrical effects.) So because we moved the
sheet of charge, we make a changing magnetic field, and therefore
electric fields must be generated. If there are electric fields
generated, they had to start from zero and change to something
else. There will be some $\ddpl{\FLPE}{t}$ that will make a
contribution, together with the current $J$, to the production of the
magnetic field. So through the various equations there is a big
intermixing, and we have to try to solve for all the fields at once.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">By looking at the Maxwell equations alone, it is not easy to see
directly how to get the solution. So we will first show you what the
answer is and then verify that it does indeed satisfy the
equations. The answer is the following: The field $\FLPB$ that we
computed is, in fact, generated right next to the current sheet (for
small $x$). It must be so, because if we make a tiny loop around the
sheet, there is no room for any electric flux to go through it. But
the field $\FLPB$ out farther—for larger $x$—is, at first,
zero. It stays zero for awhile, and then suddenly turns on. In short,
we turn on the current and the magnetic field immediately next to it
turns on to a constant value $\FLPB$; then the turning on of $\FLPB$
spreads out from the source region. After a certain time, there is a
uniform magnetic field everywhere out to some value $x$, and then zero
beyond. Because of the symmetry, it spreads in both the plus and minus
$x$-directions.</p>

<div id="Ch18-S4-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s see if these fields are consistent with Maxwell’s
equations. Let’s first draw one of those loops that we use to
calculate a line integral, say the rectangle $\Gamma_2$ shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch18-F6">18–6</a>. You notice that one side of the rectangle is
in the region where there are fields, but one side is in the region
the fields have still not reached. There is some magnetic flux through
this loop. If it is changing, there should be an emf around it. If the
wavefront is moving, we will have a changing magnetic flux, because
the area in which $\FLPB$ exists is progressively increasing at the
velocity $v$. The flux inside $\Gamma_2$ is $B$ times the part of the
area inside $\Gamma_2$ which has a magnetic field. The rate of change
of the flux, since the magnitude of $\FLPB$ is constant, is the
magnitude times the rate of change of the area. The rate of change of
the area is easy. If the width of the rectangle $\Gamma_2$ is $L$, the
area in which $\FLPB$ exists changes by $Lv\,\Delta t$ in the
time $\Delta t$. (See Fig. <a href="#Ch18-F6">18–6</a>.) The rate of change of flux
is then $BLv$. According to Faraday’s law, this should equal minus the
line integral of $\FLPE$ around $\Gamma_2$, which is just $EL$. We
have the equation
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:10}
E=vB.
\end{equation}

So if the ratio of $E$ to $B$ is $v$, the fields we have assumed will
satisfy Faraday’s equation.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S4-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">But that is not the only equation; we have the other equation relating
$\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:11}
c^2\FLPcurl{\FLPB}=\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO}+\ddp{\FLPE}{t}.
\end{equation}

To apply this equation, we look at the top view in
Fig. <a href="#Ch18-F5">18–5</a>. We have seen that this equation will give us the
value of $B$ next to the current sheet. Also, for any loop drawn outside
the sheet but behind the wavefront, there is no curl of $\FLPB$ nor
any $\FLPj$ or changing $\FLPE$, so the equation is correct there. Now let’s
look at what happens for the curve $\Gamma_1$ that intersects the
wavefront, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch18-F5">18–5</a>. Here there are no
currents, so Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1811">18.11</a>) can be written—in integral
form—as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:12}
c^2\oint_{\Gamma_1}\FLPB\cdot d\FLPs=\ddt{}{t}\!\!
\underset{\text{inside $\Gamma_1$}}{\int}
\!\FLPE\cdot\FLPn\,da.
\end{equation}

The line integral of $\FLPB$ is just $B$ times $L$. The rate of change
of the flux of $\FLPE$ is due only to the advancing wavefront. The
area inside $\Gamma_1$, where $\FLPE$ is not zero, is increasing at
the rate $vL$. The right-hand side of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1812">18.12</a>) is
then $vLE$. That equation becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:13}
c^2B=Ev.
\end{equation}

</div>
<div id="Ch18-S4-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">We have a solution in which we have a constant $\FLPB$ and a constant $\FLPE$
behind the front, both at right angles to the direction in which the front is
moving and at right angles to each other. Maxwell’s equations specify the ratio

\begin{equation*}
E=vB,\quad\text{and}\quad E=\frac{c^2}{v}\,B.
\end{equation*}

But one moment! We have found <em class="emph">two different</em> conditions on the
ratio $E/B$. Can such a field as we describe really exist? There is,
of course, only one velocity $v$ for which both of these equations can
hold, namely $v=c$. The wavefront must travel with the
velocity $c$. We have an example in which the electrical influence from a
current propagates at a certain finite velocity $c$.</p>

<div id="Ch18-S4-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let’s ask what happens if we suddenly stop the motion of the
charged sheet after it has been on for a short time $T$. We can see
what will happen by the principle of superposition. We had a current
that was zero and then was suddenly turned on. We know the solution
for that case. Now we are going to add another set of fields. We take
another charged sheet and suddenly start it moving, in the opposite
direction with the same speed, only at the time $T$ after we started
the first current. The total current of the two added together is
first zero, then on for a time $T$, then off again—because the two
currents cancel. We have a square “pulse” of current.

Fig. <a href="#Ch18-F4">18–4</a>(b). So we have two “blocks” of field marching
out at the speed $c$, as in parts (a) and (b) of Fig. <a href="#Ch18-F4">18–4</a>.
The combined fields are as shown in part (c) of the figure. The fields
are zero for $x&gt;ct$, they are constant (with the values we found above)
between $x=c(t-T)$ and $x=ct$, and again zero for $x&lt;c(t - T)$.</p>

themselves. Suppose the magnetic field were to disappear. There would be
a changing magnetic field which would produce an electric field. If this
electric field tries to go away, the changing electric field would
create a magnetic field back again. So by a perpetual interplay—by the
swishing back and forth from one field to the other—they must go on
forever. It is impossible for them to disappear.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> They maintain

<span class="tag">18–5</span>The speed of light</h3>
<div id="Ch18-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We have a wave which leaves the material source and goes outward at
the velocity $c$, which is the speed of light. But let’s go back a
moment. From a historical point of view, it wasn’t known that the
coefficient $c$ in Maxwell’s equations was also the speed of light
propagation. There was just a constant in the equations. We have
called it $c$ from the beginning, because we knew what it would turn
out to be. We didn’t think it would be sensible to make you learn the
formulas with a different constant and then go back to substitute $c$
wherever it belonged. From the point of view of electricity and
magnetism, however, we just start out with two constants, $\epsO$
and $c^2$, that appear in the equations of electrostatics and
magnetostatics:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:14}
\FLPdiv{\FLPE} =\frac{\rho}{\epsO}
\end{equation}

and
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:15}
\FLPcurl{\FLPB} =\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO c^2}.
\end{equation}

If we take any <em class="emph">arbitrary</em> definition of a unit of charge, we can
determine experimentally the constant $\epsO$ required in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1814">18.14</a>)—say by measuring the force between two unit
charges at rest, using Coulomb’s law. We must also determine
experimentally the constant $\epsO c^2$ that appears in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1815">18.15</a>), which we can do, say, by measuring the force
between two unit currents. (A unit current means one unit of charge per
second.) The ratio of these two experimental constants is $c^2$—just
another “electromagnetic constant.”</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Notice now that this constant $c^2$ is the same no matter what we
choose for our unit of charge. If we put twice as much
“charge”—say twice as many proton charges—in our “unit” of
charge, $\epsO$ would need to be one-fourth as large. When we pass two
of these “unit” currents through two wires, there will be twice as
much “charge” per second in each wire, so the force between two
wires is four times larger. The constant $\epsO c^2$ must be reduced
by one-fourth. But the ratio $\epsO c^2/\epsO$ is unchanged.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">So just by experiments with charges and currents we find a
number $c^2$ which turns out to be the square of the velocity of propagation
of electromagnetic influences. From static measurements—by measuring
the forces between two unit charges and between two unit currents—we
find that $c=3.00\times10^8$ meters/sec. When
Maxwell first made this
calculation with his equations, he said that bundles of electric and
magnetic fields should be propagated at this speed. He also remarked
on the mysterious coincidence that this was the same as the speed of
light. “We can scarcely avoid the inference,” said
Maxwell, “that
light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which
is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.”</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Maxwell had made one of the
great unifications of physics. Before his
time, there was light, and there was electricity and magnetism. The
latter two had been unified by the experimental work of
Faraday, Oersted, and Ampère. Then, all of a
sudden, light was no longer “something else,” but was only electricity
and magnetism in this new form—little pieces of electric and magnetic
fields which propagate through space on their own.</p>

and that the two vectors $\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$ are perpendicular to each
other. Furthermore, the magnitude of the electric field $E$ is equal
to $c$ times the magnitude of the magnetic field $B$. These three
facts—that the two fields are transverse to the direction of

$E=cB$—are generally true for any electromagnetic wave. Our special

Maxwell’s equations in a simpler form. You may consider that we are
complicating them, but if you will be patient a little bit, they will
suddenly come out simpler. Although by this time you are thoroughly
used to each of the Maxwell equations, there are many pieces that must
all be put together. That’s what we want to do.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We begin with $\FLPdiv{\FLPB}=0$—the simplest of the equations. We
know that it implies that $\FLPB$ is the curl of something. So, if we
write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:16}
\FLPB=\FLPcurl{\FLPA},
\end{equation}

we have already solved one of Maxwell’s equations. (Incidentally, you
appreciate that it remains true that another vector $\FLPA'$ would be
just as good if $\FLPA'=\FLPA+\FLPgrad{\psi}$—where $\psi$ is any
scalar field—because the curl of $\FLPgrad{\psi}$ is zero,
and $\FLPB$ is still the same. We have talked about that before.)</p>

<div id="Ch18-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We take next the Faraday law, $\FLPcurl{\FLPE}=-\ddpl{\FLPB}{t}$,
because it doesn’t involve any currents or charges. If we write
$\FLPB$ as $\FLPcurl{\FLPA}$ and differentiate with respect to $t$, we
can write Faraday’s law in the form
\begin{equation*}
\FLPcurl{\FLPE}=-\ddp{}{t}\,\FLPcurl{\FLPA}.
\end{equation*}

Since we can differentiate either with respect to time or to space
first, we can also write this equation as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:17}
\FLPcurl{\biggl(\FLPE+\ddp{\FLPA}{t}\biggr)}=\FLPzero.
\end{equation}

We see that $\FLPE+\ddpl{\FLPA}{t}$ is a vector whose curl is equal to
zero. Therefore that vector is the gradient of something. When we
worked on electrostatics, we had $\FLPcurl{\FLPE}=\FLPzero$, and then
we decided that $\FLPE$ itself was the gradient of something. We took
it to be the gradient of $-\phi$ (the minus for technical
convenience). We do the same thing for $\FLPE+\ddpl{\FLPA}{t}$; we set
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:18}
\FLPE+\ddp{\FLPA}{t}=-\FLPgrad{\phi}.
\end{equation}

We use the same symbol $\phi$ so that, in the electrostatic case where
nothing changes with time and the $\ddpl{\FLPA}{t}$ term disappears,
$\FLPE$ will be our old $-\FLPgrad{\phi}$. So Faraday’s equation can
be put in the form

precaution. We can, however, still allow $\FLPA$ to be changed in this
way without affecting the fields $\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$—that is,
without changing the physics—if we always change $\FLPA$ and $\phi$

<p class="p">Now we return to the two remaining Maxwell equations which will give us
relations between the potentials and the sources $\rho$ and $\FLPj$. Once we can
determine $\FLPA$ and $\phi$ from the currents and charges, we can always get
$\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$ from Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1816">18.16</a>)
and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1819">18.19</a>), so we will have another form of Maxwell’s equations.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch18-S6-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">We begin by substituting Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1819">18.19</a>) into
$\FLPdiv{\FLPE}=\rho/\epsO$; we get
\begin{equation*}
\FLPdiv{\biggl(-\FLPgrad{\phi}-\ddp{\FLPA}{t}\biggr)}=\frac{\rho}{\epsO},

which we can write also as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:21}
-\nabla^2\phi-\ddp{}{t}\,\FLPdiv{\FLPA}=\frac{\rho}{\epsO}.

This is one equation relating $\phi$ and $\FLPA$ to the sources.</p>

<p class="p">Our final equation will be the most complicated. We start by rewriting
the fourth Maxwell equation as
\begin{equation*}
c^2\FLPcurl{\FLPB}-\ddp{\FLPE}{t}=\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO},
\end{equation*}

and then substitute for $\FLPB$ and $\FLPE$ in terms of the potentials, using
Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1816">18.16</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1819">18.19</a>):
\begin{equation*}
c^2\FLPcurl{(\FLPcurl{\FLPA})}-\ddp{}{t}\,
\biggl(-\FLPgrad{\phi}-\ddp{\FLPA}{t}\biggr)=
\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO}.

The first term can be rewritten using the algebraic identity:
$\FLPcurl{(\FLPcurl{\FLPA})}=$ $\FLPgrad{(\FLPdiv{\FLPA})}-\nabla^2\FLPA$;
we get
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}

<p class="p">Fortunately, we can now make use of our freedom to choose arbitrarily
the divergence of $\FLPA$. What we are going to do is to use our
choice to fix things so that the equations for $\FLPA$ and for $\phi$
are separated but have the same form. We can do this by
taking<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a>
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:23}
\FLPdiv{\FLPA}=-\frac{1}{c^2}\,\ddp{\phi}{t}.
\end{equation}

When we do that, the two middle terms in $\FLPA$ and $\phi$ in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1822">18.22</a>) cancel, and that equation becomes much simpler:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:24}
\nabla^2\FLPA-\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\FLPA}{\partial t^2}=
-\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO c^2}.
\end{equation}

And our equation for $\phi$—Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1821">18.21</a>)—takes on the
same form:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:25}
\nabla^2\phi-\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial t^2}=
-\frac{\rho}{\epsO}.

<p class="p">What a beautiful set of equations! They are beautiful, first, because
they are nicely separated—with the charge density, goes $\phi$; with
the current, goes $\FLPA$. Furthermore, although the left side looks a
little funny—a Laplacian together with a $\partial^2/\partial t^2$—when we
unfold it we see
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:18:26}
\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial x^2}+
\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial y^2}+
\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial z^2}-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial t^2}=
-\frac{\rho}{\epsO}.
\end{equation}

It has a nice symmetry in $x$, $y$, $z$, $t$—the $-1/c^2$ is
necessary because, of course, time and space <em class="emph">are</em> different;
they have different units.</p>

<p class="p">Maxwell’s equations have led us to a new kind of equation for the
potentials $\phi$ and $\FLPA$ but to the same mathematical form for
all four functions $\phi$, $A_x$, $A_y$, and $A_z$. Once we learn how
to solve these equations, we can get $\FLPB$ and $\FLPE$ from
$\FLPcurl{\FLPA}$ and $-\FLPgrad{\phi}-\ddpl{\FLPA}{t}$. We have
another form of the electromagnetic laws exactly equivalent to
Maxwell’s equations, and in many situations they are much simpler to
handle.</p>

<p class="p">We have, in fact, already solved an equation much like
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1826">18.26</a>). When we studied sound in
Chapter <a href="I_47.html">47</a> of Vol. I, we had an equation of the form
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial x^2}=
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial t^2},
\end{equation*}

and we saw that it described the propagation of waves in the
$x$-direction at the speed $c$. Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1826">18.26</a>) is the
corresponding wave equation for three dimensions. So in regions where
there are no longer any charges and currents, the solution of these
equations is <em class="emph">not</em> that $\phi$ and $\FLPA$ are zero. (Although
that is indeed one possible solution.)  There are solutions in which
there is some set of $\phi$ and $\FLPA$ which are changing in time but
always moving out at the speed $c$. The fields travel onward through
free space, as in our example at the beginning of the chapter.</p>

<div id="Ch18-S6-p14" class="para">
<p class="p">With Maxwell’s
new term in Eq. IV, we have been able to write the
field equations in terms of $\FLPA$ and $\phi$ in a form that is
simple and that makes immediately apparent that there are
electromagnetic waves. For many practical purposes, it will still be
convenient to use the original equations in terms of $\FLPE$
and $\FLPB$. But they are on the other side of the mountain we have
already climbed. Now we are ready to cross over to the other side of
the peak. Things will look different—we are ready for some new and
beautiful views.</p>

  Well, not
quite. They can be “absorbed” if they get to a region where there are
charges. By which we mean that other fields can be produced somewhere
which superpose on these fields and “cancel” them by destructive
interference (see Chapter <a href="I_31.html">31</a>, Vol. I).

  Choosing the $\FLPdiv{\FLPA}$ is called “choosing a
gauge.” Changing $\FLPA$ by adding $\FLPgrad{\psi}$, is called a
“gauge transformation.” Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1823">18.23</a>) is called “the
Lorenz gauge.”
