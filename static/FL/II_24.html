<span class="tag">24–1</span>The transmission line</h3>
<div id="Ch24-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In the last chapter we studied what happened to the lumped
elements of circuits when they were operated at very high frequencies,
and we were led to see that a resonant circuit could be replaced by a
cavity with the fields resonating inside. Another interesting technical
problem is the connection of one object to another, so that
electromagnetic energy can be transmitted between them. In low-frequency
circuits the connection is made with wires, but this method doesn’t work
very well at high frequencies because the circuits would radiate energy
into all the space around them, and it is hard to control where the
energy will go. The fields spread out around the wires; the currents and
voltages are not “guided” very well by the wires. In this chapter we
want to look into the ways that objects can be interconnected at high
frequencies. At least, that’s one way of presenting our subject.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Another way is to say that we have been discussing the behavior of
waves in free space. Now it is time to see what happens when
oscillating fields are confined in one or more dimensions. We will
discover the interesting new phenomenon when the fields are confined
in only two dimensions and allowed to go free in the third dimension,
they propagate in waves. These are “guided waves”—the subject of
this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We begin by working out the general theory of the <em class="emph">transmission
line</em>. The ordinary power transmission line that runs from tower to
tower over the countryside radiates away some of its power, but the
power frequencies ($50$–$60$ cycles/sec) are so low that this loss is
not serious. The radiation could be stopped by surrounding the line
with a metal pipe, but this method would not be practical for power
lines because the voltages and currents used would require a very
large, expensive, and heavy pipe. So simple “open lines” are used.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">For somewhat higher frequencies—say a few kilocycles—radiation can
already be serious. However, it can be reduced by using
“twisted-pair” transmission lines, as is done for short-run
telephone connections. At higher frequencies, however, the radiation
soon becomes intolerable, either because of power losses or because
the energy appears in other circuits where it isn’t wanted. For
frequencies from a few kilocycles to some hundreds of megacycles,
electromagnetic signals and power are usually transmitted via coaxial
lines consisting of a wire inside a cylindrical
“outer conductor” or “shield.” Although the following treatment will
apply to a transmission line of two parallel conductors of any shape, we
will carry it out referring to a coaxial line.

<span class="tag">Fig. 24–1.</span>A coaxial transmission line.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We take the simplest coaxial line that has a central conductor, which
we suppose is a thin hollow cylinder, and an outer conductor which is
another thin cylinder on the same axis as the inner conductor, as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch24-F1">24–1</a>. We begin by figuring out approximately how the
line behaves at relatively low frequencies. We have already described
some of the low-frequency behavior when we said earlier that two such
conductors had a certain amount of inductance per unit length or a
certain capacity per unit length. We can, in fact, describe the
low-frequency behavior of any transmission line by giving its inductance
per unit length, $L_0$ and its capacity per unit length, $C_0$. Then we
can analyze the line as the limiting case of the $L$-$C$ filter as
discussed in Section <a href="II_22.html#Ch22-S6">22–6</a>. We can make a filter which
imitates the line by taking small series elements $L_0\,\Delta x$ and
small shunt capacities $C_0\,\Delta x$, where $\Delta x$ is an element
of length of the line. Using our results for the infinite filter, we see
that there would be a propagation of electric signals along the line.
Rather than following that approach, however, we would now rather look
at the line from the point of view of a differential equation.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose that we see what happens at two neighboring points along the
transmission line, say at the distances $x$ and $x+\Delta x$ from the
beginning of the line. Let’s call the voltage difference between the two
conductors $V(x)$, and the current along the “hot” conductor $I(x)$
(see Fig. <a href="#Ch24-F2">24–2</a>). If the current in the line is varying, the
inductance will give us a voltage drop across the small section of line

<div id="Ch24-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Referring again to the figure, if the voltage at $x$ is changing,
there must be some charge supplied to the capacity in that region. If
we take the small piece of line between $x$ and $x+\Delta x$, the
charge on it is $q=C_0\,\Delta x V$. The time rate-of-change of this
charge is $C_0\,\Delta x\,dV/dt$, but the charge changes only if the
current $I(x)$ into the element is different from the
current $I(x+\Delta x)$ out. Calling the difference $\Delta I$, we have
\begin{equation*}
\Delta I=-C_0\,\Delta x\,\ddt{V}{t}.

Taking the limit as $\Delta x\to0$, we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:24:2}

\begin{equation*}
U=\frac{\epsO c^2}{2}\int_a^b\biggl(
\frac{I}{2\pi\epsO c^2r}
\biggr)^2l\,2\pi r\,dr,

the inductance per unit length $L_0$ is

<p class="p">Although it may seem to be a remarkable thing when one has been
thinking in terms of a transmission line as a distributed inductance
and capacity, we all know that electromagnetic waves can travel along
inside a hollow metal pipe. If the pipe is straight, we can <i>see</i>
through it! So certainly electromagnetic waves go through a pipe. But
we also know that it is not possible to transmit low-frequency waves
(power or telephone) through the inside of a single metal pipe. So it
must be that electromagnetic waves will go through if their wavelength
is short enough. Therefore we want to discuss the limiting case of the
longest wavelength (or the lowest frequency) that can get through a
pipe of a given size. Since the pipe is then being used to carry
waves, it is called a <em class="emph">waveguide</em>.</p>

guide of arbitrary shape, so the mathematical argument is fundamentally
more sound.</p>

in fact, it must go to zero at the sides parallel to the $y$-axis,
because the currents and charges in a conductor always adjust
themselves so that there is no tangential component of the electric
field at the surface of a conductor. So $E_y$ will vary with $x$ in
some arch, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch24-F4">24–4</a>. Perhaps it is the Bessel function

simple harmonic functions, so we should try something like $\sin

frequency $\omega$, we would guess that the wave might vary with $z$
like $\cos\,(\omega t-k_zz)$, or to use the more convenient
mathematical form, like $e^{i(\omega t-k_zz)}$. This $z$-dependence

<p class="p">Let’s see whether this guess satisfies the correct field
equations. First, the electric field should have no tangential

is perpendicular to the top and bottom faces and is zero at the two

of $\sin k_xx$ just fits in the width of the guide—that is, if
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:24:13}
k_xa=\pi.

There are other possibilities, like $k_xa=2\pi$, $3\pi$, $\dotsc$, or, in
general,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:24:14}
k_xa=n\pi,

where $n$ is any integer. These represent various complicated
arrangements of the field, but for now let’s take only the simplest
one, where $k_x=\pi/a$, where $a$ is the width of the inside of the
guide.</p>

<p class="p">Next, the divergence of $\FLPE$ must be zero in the free space inside

<div id="Ch24-S2-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Finally, our electric field must agree with the rest of Maxwell’s

\frac{\partial^2E_y}{\partial y^2}+
\frac{\partial^2E_y}{\partial z^2}-
\frac{1}{c^2}\,\frac{\partial^2E_y}{\partial t^2}=0.

We have to see whether our guess, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2412">24.12</a>), will
work. The second derivative of $E_y$ with respect to $x$ is
just $-k_x^2E_y$. The second derivative with respect to $y$ is zero, since
nothing depends on $y$. The second derivative with respect to $z$
is $-k_z^2E_y$, and the second derivative with respect to $t$
is $-\omega^2E_y$. Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2415">24.15</a>) then says that
\begin{equation*}
k_x^2E_y+k_z^2E_y-\frac{\omega^2}{c^2}\,E_y=0.

Unless $E_y$ is zero everywhere (which is not very interesting), this
equation is correct if
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:24:16}
k_x^2+k_z^2-\frac{\omega^2}{c^2}=0.

We have already fixed $k_x$, so this equation tells us that there can
be waves of the type we have assumed if $k_z$ is related to the

Taking the derivative of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2417">24.17</a>) with respect
to $\omega$ and inverting to get $d\omega/dk$, we find that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:24:27}
v_{\text{group}}=c\sqrt{1-(\omega_c/\omega)^2},
\end{equation}

which is less than the speed of light.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">The geometric mean of $v_{\text{phase}}$ and $v_{\text{group}}$ is
just $c$, the speed of light:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:24:28}
v_{\text{phase}}v_{\text{group}}=c^2.
\end{equation}

This is curious, because we have seen a similar relation in quantum
mechanics. For a particle with any velocity—even relativistic—the
momentum $p$ and energy $U$ are related by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:24:29}
U^2=p^2c^2+m^2c^4.
\end{equation}

But in quantum mechanics the energy is $\hbar\omega$, and the momentum
is $\hbar/\lambdabar$, which is equal to $\hbar k$; so
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2429">24.29</a>) can be written
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:24:30}
\frac{\omega^2}{c^2}=k^2+\frac{m^2c^2}{\hbar^2},

or
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:24:31}
k=\sqrt{(\omega^2/c^2)-(m^2c^2/\hbar^2)},

<div id="Ch24-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The group velocity of the waves is also the speed at which energy is
transported along the guide. If we want to find the energy flow down
the guide, we can get it from the energy density times the group
velocity. If the root mean square electric field is $E_0$, then the
average density of electric energy is $\epsO E_0^2/2$. There is also
some energy associated with the magnetic field. We will not prove it
here, but in any cavity or guide the magnetic and electric energies
are equal, so the total electromagnetic energy density is $\epsO
E_0^2$. The power $dU/dt$ transmitted by the guide is then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:24:32}
\ddt{U}{t}=\epsO E_0^2abv_{\text{group}}.

<div id="Ch24-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Energy can be coupled into a waveguide by some kind of an “antenna.”
For example, a little vertical wire or “stub” will do. The presence of
the guided waves can be observed by picking up some of the
electromagnetic energy with a little receiving “antenna,” which again
can be a little stub of wire or a small loop. In Fig. <a href="#Ch24-F8">24–8</a>,
we show a guide with some cutaways to show a driving stub and a pickup
“probe”. The driving stub can be connected to a signal generator via a
coaxial cable, and the pickup probe can be connected by a similar cable
to a detector. It is usually convenient to insert the pickup probe via a
long thin slot in the guide, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch24-F8">24–8</a>. Then
the probe can be moved back and forth along the guide to sample the
fields at various positions.</p>

the cutoff frequency $\omega_c$, there will be waves propagated down
the guide from the driving stub. These will be the only waves present
if the guide is infinitely long, which can effectively be arranged by
terminating the guide with a carefully designed absorber in such a way
that there are no reflections from the far end. Then, since the
detector measures the time average of the fields near the probe, it
will pick up a signal which is independent of the position along the
guide; its output will be proportional to the power being transmitted.

standing wave in the guide similar to the standing waves on a string
which we discussed in Chapter <a href="I_49.html">49</a> of Vol. I. Then, as
the pickup probe is moved along the line, the detector reading will
rise and fall periodically, showing a maximum in the fields at each
loop of the standing wave and a minimum at each node. The distance
between two successive nodes (or loops) is just $\lambda_g/2$. This
gives a convenient way of measuring the guide wavelength. If the
frequency is now moved closer to $\omega_c$, the distances between
nodes increase, showing that the guide wavelength increases as

<div id="Ch24-S6-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">An important practical use of waveguides is for the transmission of
high-frequency power, as, for example, in coupling the high-frequency
oscillator or output amplifier of a radar set to an antenna. In fact,
the antenna itself usually consists of a parabolic reflector fed at
its focus by a waveguide flared out at the end to make a “horn” that
radiates the waves coming along the guide. Although high frequencies
can be transmitted along a coaxial cable, a waveguide is better for
transmitting large amounts of power. First, the maximum power that can
be transmitted along a line is limited by the breakdown of the
insulation (solid or gas) between the conductors. For a given amount
of power, the field strengths in a guide are usually less than they
are in a coaxial cable, so higher powers can be transmitted before
breakdown occurs. Second, the power losses in the coaxial cable are
usually greater than in a waveguide. In a coaxial cable there must be
insulating material to support the central conductor, and there is an
energy loss in this material—particularly at high frequencies. Also,
the current densities on the central conductor are quite high, and
since the losses go as the <em class="emph">square</em> of the current density, the
lower currents that appear on the walls of the guide result in lower
energy losses. To keep these losses to a minimum, the inner surfaces
of the guide are often plated with a material of high conductivity,
such as silver.</p>

<div id="Ch24-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">The problem of connecting a “circuit” with waveguides is quite
different from the corresponding circuit problem at low frequencies,
and is usually called microwave “plumbing.” Many special devices
have been developed for the purpose. For instance, two sections of
waveguide are usually connected together by means of flanges, as can
be seen in Fig. <a href="#Ch24-F9">24–9</a>. Such connections can, however,
cause serious energy losses, because the surface currents must flow
across the joint, which may have a relatively high resistance. One way
to avoid such losses is to make the flanges as shown in the cross
section drawn in Fig. <a href="#Ch24-F10">24–10</a>. A small space is left
between the adjacent sections of the guide, and a groove is cut in the
face of one of the flanges to make a small cavity of the type shown in
Fig. <a href="II_23.html#Ch23-F16">23–16</a>(c). The dimensions are chosen so that this
cavity is resonant at the frequency being used. This resonant cavity
presents a high “impedance” to the currents, so relatively little
current flows across the metallic joints (at $a$ in
Fig. <a href="#Ch24-F10">24–10</a>). The high guide currents simply charge and
discharge the “capacity” of the gap (at $b$ in the figure), where
there is little dissipation of energy.</p>

reflected waves. Then you must put something at the end that imitates
an infinite length of guide. You need a “termination” which acts for
the guide like the characteristic impedance does for a transmission
line—something that absorbs the arriving waves without making
reflections. Then the guide will act as though it went on forever.
Such terminations are made by putting inside the guide some wedges of
resistance material carefully designed to absorb the wave energy while
generating almost no reflected waves.</p>

have connected a complicated arrangement of waveguides. Suppose you
want to know which way the waves are going in a particular section of
guide—you might be wondering, for instance, whether or not there is
a strong reflected wave. The unidirectional coupler takes out a small
fraction of the power of a guide if there is a wave going one way, but
none if the wave is going the other way. By connecting the output of
the coupler to a detector, you can measure the “one-way” power in
the guide.</p>

piece of waveguide $AB$ has another piece of waveguide $CD$ soldered to
it along one face. The guide $CD$ is curved away so that there is room
for the connecting flanges. Before the guides are soldered together, two
(or more) holes have been drilled in each guide (matching each other) so
that some of the fields in the main guide $AB$ can be coupled into the
secondary guide $CD$. Each of the holes acts like a little antenna that
produces a wave in the secondary guide. If there were only one hole,
waves would be sent in both directions and would be the same no matter
which way the wave was going in the primary guide. But when there are
<em class="emph">two</em> holes with a separation space equal to one-quarter of the
guide wavelength, they will make two sources $90^\circ$ out of phase. Do
you remember that we considered in Chapter <a href="I_29.html">29</a> of Vol. I
the interference of the waves from two antennas spaced $\lambda/4$ apart
and excited $90^\circ$ out of phase in time?  We found that the waves
subtract in one direction and add in the opposite direction. The same
thing will happen here. The wave produced in the guide $CD$ will be
going in the same direction as the wave in $AB$.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S7-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">The wave we have chosen to analyze is a special solution of the field
equations. There are many more. Each solution is called a waveguide
“mode.” For example, our $x$-dependence of the field was just
one-half a cycle of a sine wave. There is an equally good solution
with a full cycle; then the variation of $E_y$ with $x$ is as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch24-F14">24–14</a>. The $k_x$ for such a mode is twice as large, so the
cutoff frequency is much higher. Also, in the wave we studied $\FLPE$
has only a $y$-component, but there are other modes with more
complicated electric fields. If the electric field has components only
in $x$ and $y$—so that the total electric field is always at right
angles to the $z$-direction—the mode is called a “transverse
electric” (or TE) mode. The magnetic field of such modes will always
have a $z$-component. It turns out that if $\FLPE$ has a component in
the $z$-direction (along the direction of propagation), then the
magnetic field will always have only transverse components. So such
fields are called transverse magnetic (TM) modes. For a rectangular
guide, all the other modes have a higher cutoff frequency than the
simple TE mode we have described. It is, therefore, possible—and
usual—to use a guide with a frequency just above the cutoff for this
lowest mode but below the cutoff frequency for all the others, so that
just the one mode is propagated. Otherwise, the behavior gets
complicated and difficult to control.</p>

<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">24–8</span>Another way of looking at the guided waves</h3>
<div id="Ch24-S8-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We want now to show you another way of understanding why a waveguide
attenuates the fields rapidly for frequencies below the cutoff
frequency $\omega_c$. Then you will have a more “physical” idea of
why the behavior changes so drastically between low and high
frequencies. We can do this for the rectangular guide by analyzing the
fields in terms of reflections—or images—in the walls of the
guide. The approach only works for rectangular guides, however; that’s
why we started with the more mathematical analysis which works, in
principle, for guides of any shape.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S8-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">For the mode we have described, the vertical dimension (in $y$) had no
effect, so we can ignore the top and bottom of the guide and imagine
that the guide is extended indefinitely in the vertical direction. We
imagine then that the guide just consists of two vertical plates with
the separation $a$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S8-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s say that the source of the fields is a vertical wire placed in
the middle of the guide, with the wire carrying a current that
oscillates at the frequency $\omega$. In the absence of the guide
walls such a wire would radiate cylindrical waves.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S8-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we consider that the guide walls are perfect conductors. Then,
just as in electrostatics, the conditions at the surface will be
correct if we add to the field of the wire the field of one or more
suitable image wires. The image idea works just as well for
electrodynamics as it does for electrostatics, provided, of course,
that we also include the retardations. We know that is true because we
have often seen a mirror producing an image of a light source. And a
mirror is just a “perfect” conductor for electromagnetic waves with
optical frequencies.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S8-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let’s take a horizontal cross section, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch24-F15">24–15</a>,
where $W_1$ and $W_2$ are the two guide walls and $S_0$ is the source
wire. We call the direction of the current in the wire positive. Now
if there were only one wall, say $W_1$, we could remove it if we
placed an image source (with opposite polarity) at the position
marked $S_1$. But with both walls in place there will also be an image
of $S_0$ in the wall $W_2$, which we show as the image $S_2$. This
source, too, will have an image in $W_1$, which we call $S_3$. Now
both $S_1$ and $S_3$ will have images in $W_2$ at the positions marked
$S_4$ and $S_6$, and so on. For our two plane conductors with the
source halfway between, the fields are the same as those produced by
an infinite line of sources, all separated by the distance $a$. (It
is, in fact just what you would <em class="emph">see</em> if you looked at a wire
placed halfway between two parallel mirrors.)  For the fields to be
zero at the walls, the polarity of the currents in the images must
alternate from one image to the next. In other words, they oscillate
$180^\circ$ out of phase. The waveguide field is, then, just the
superposition of the fields of such an infinite set of line sources.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S8-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">We know that if we are close to the sources, the field is very much
like the static fields. We considered in Section <a href="II_07.html#Ch7-S5">7–5</a>
the static field of a grid of line sources and found that it is like
the field of a charged plate except for terms that decrease
exponentially with the distance from the grid. Here the average source
strength is zero, because the sign alternates from one source to the
next. Any fields which exist should fall off exponentially with
distance. Close to the source, we see the field mainly of the nearest
source; at large distances, many sources contribute and their average
effect is zero. So now we see why the waveguide below cutoff frequency
gives an exponentially decreasing field. At low frequencies, in
particular, the static approximation is good, and it predicts a rapid
attenuation of the fields with distance.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch24-S8-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we are faced with the opposite question: Why are waves propagated
at all? That is the mysterious part! The reason is that at high
frequencies the retardation of the fields can introduce additional
changes in phase which can cause the fields of the out-of-phase
sources to add instead of cancelling. In fact, in
Chapter <a href="I_29.html">29</a> of Vol. I we have already studied, just for
this problem, the fields generated by an array of antennas or by an
optical grating. There we found that when several radio antennas are
suitably arranged, they can give an interference pattern that has a
strong signal in some direction but no signal in another.</p>

which arrive at a large distance from the array of image sources. The
fields will be strong only in certain directions which depend on the
frequency—only in those directions for which the fields from all the
sources add in phase. At a reasonable distance from the sources the
field propagates in these special directions as plane waves. We have
sketched such a wave in Fig. <a href="#Ch24-F16">24–16</a>, where the solid lines
represent the wave crests and the dashed lines represent the troughs.
The wave direction will be the one for which the difference in the
retardation for two neighboring sources to the crest of a wave
corresponds to one-half a period of oscillation. In other words, the
difference between $r_2$ and $r_0$ in the figure is one-half of the
free-space wavelength:
\begin{equation}
r_2-r_0=\frac{\lambda_0}{2}.\notag

appears to be travelling along the guide with a
wavelength $\lambda_g$, which is the distance from $A$ to $C$.
That distance is related to $\theta$ by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:24:34}
\cos\theta=\frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda_g}.
