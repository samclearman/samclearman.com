<span class="tag">37–1</span>Understanding ferromagnetism</h3>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In this chapter we will discuss the behavior and peculiarities of
ferromagnetic materials and of other strange magnetic
materials. Before proceeding to study magnetic materials, however, we
will review very quickly some of the things about the general theory
of magnets that we learned in the last chapter.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">First, we imagine the atomic currents inside the material that are
responsible for the magnetism, and then describe them in terms of a
volume current density $\FLPj_{\text{mag}}=\FLPcurl{\FLPM}$. We
emphasize that this is not supposed to represent the <em class="emph">actual</em>
currents. When the magnetization is uniform the currents do not
<em class="emph">really</em> cancel out precisely; that is, the whirling currents of
one electron in one atom and the whirling currents of an electron in
another atom do not overlap in such a way that the sum is exactly
zero. Even within a single atom the distribution of magnetism is
<em class="emph">not</em> smooth. For instance, in an iron atom the magnetization is
distributed in a more or less spherical shell, not too close to the
nucleus and not too far away. Thus, magnetism in matter is quite a
complicated thing in its details; it is very irregular. However, we
are obliged now to ignore this detailed complexity and discuss
phenomena from a gross, average point of view. Then it is true that
the <em class="emph">average</em> current in the interior region, over any finite
area that is big compared with an atom, is zero when
$\FLPM=\FLPzero$. So, what we mean by magnetization per unit volume
and $\FLPj_{\text{mag}}$ and so on, at the level we are now
considering, is an average over regions that are large compared with
the space occupied by a single atom.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">In the last chapter, we also discovered that a ferromagnetic material
has the following interesting property: above a certain temperature it
is not strongly magnetic, whereas below this temperature it becomes
magnetic. This fact is easily demonstrated. A piece of nickel wire at
room temperature is attracted by a magnet. However, if we heat it
above its Curie temperature with a gas flame, it becomes nonmagnetic
and is not attracted toward the magnet—even when brought quite close
to the magnet. If we let it lie near the magnet while it cools off, at
the instant its temperature falls below the critical temperature it is
suddenly attracted again by the magnet!</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">The general theory of ferromagnetism that we will use supposes that the
spin of the electron is responsible for the magnetization. The electron
has spin one-half and carries one Bohr magneton of magnetic
moment $\mu=$ $\mu_B=$ $q_e\hbar/2m$. The electron spin can be pointed either
“up” or “down.” Because the electron has a negative charge, when its
spin is “up” it has a <em class="emph">negative</em> moment, and when its spin is
“down” it has a <em class="emph">positive</em> moment. With our usual conventions,
the moment $\FLPmu$ of the electron is opposite its spin. We have found
that the energy of orientation of a magnetic dipole in a given applied
field $\FLPB$ is $-\FLPmu\cdot\FLPB$, but the energy of the spinning
electrons depends on the neighboring spin alignments as well. In iron,
if the moment of a nearby atom is “up,” there is a very strong
tendency that the moment of the one next to it will also be “up.” That
is what makes iron, cobalt, and nickel so strongly magnetic—the
moments all want to be parallel. The first question we have to discuss
is <em class="emph">why</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Soon after the development of quantum mechanics, it was noticed that
there is a very strong <em class="emph">apparent</em> force—not a magnetic force or
any other kind of actual force, but only an apparent force—trying to
line the spins of nearby electrons <em class="emph">opposite</em> to one another. These
forces are closely related to chemical valence forces. There is a
principle in quantum mechanics—called the <em class="emph">exclusion
principle</em>—that two electrons cannot occupy exactly the same state,
that they cannot be in exactly the same condition as to location and
spin orientation.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> For example, if they are at the same
point, the only alternative is to have their spins opposite. So, if
there is a region of space between atoms where electrons like to
congregate (as in a chemical bond) and we want to put another electron
on top of one already there, the only way to do it is to have the spin
of the second one pointed opposite to the spin of the first one. To have
the spins parallel is against the law, unless the electrons stay away
from each other. This has the effect that a pair of parallel-spin
electrons near to each other have much more energy than a pair of
opposite-spin electrons; the net effect is as though there were a force
trying to turn the spin over. Sometimes this spin-turning force is
called the <em class="emph">exchange force</em>, but that only makes it more
mysterious—it is not a very good term. It is just because of the
exclusion principle that electrons have a tendency to make their spins
opposite. In fact, that is the explanation of the <em class="emph">lack</em> of
magnetism in almost all substances! The spins of the free electrons on
the outside of the atoms have tremendous tendency to balance in opposite
directions. The problem is to explain why for materials like iron it is
just the reverse of what we should expect.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">We have summarized the supposed alignment effect by adding a suitable
term in the energy equation, by saying that if the electron magnets in
the neighborhood have a mean magnetization $M$, then the moment of an
electron has a strong tendency to be in the same direction as the
average magnetization of the atoms in the neighborhood. Thus, we may
write for the two possible spin orientations,<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a>
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:37:1}
\begin{aligned}
\text{Spin “up” energy}
&=+\mu\biggl(H+\frac{\lambda M}{\epsO c^2}\biggr),\\[1ex]
\text{Spin “down” energy}
&=-\mu\biggl(H+\frac{\lambda M}{\epsO c^2}\biggr).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">When it was clear that quantum mechanics could supply a tremendous
spin-orientating force—even if, apparently, of the wrong sign—it
was suggested that ferromagnetism might have its origin in this same
force, that due to the complexities of iron and the large number of
electrons involved, the sign of the interaction energy would come out
the other way around. Since the time this was thought of—in about
1927 when quantum mechanics was first being understood—many people
have been making various estimates and semicalculations, trying to get
a theoretical prediction for $\lambda$. The most recent calculations
of the energy between the two electron spins in iron—assuming that
the interaction is a direct one between the two electrons in
neighboring atoms—still give the <em class="emph">wrong sign</em>. The present
understanding of this is again to assume that the complexity of the
situation is somehow responsible and to hope that the next man who
makes the calculation with a more complicated situation will get the
right answer!</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">It is believed that the up-spin of one of the electrons in the inside
shell, which is making the magnetism, tends to make the conduction
electrons which fly around the outside have the opposite spin. One
might expect this to happen because the conduction electrons come into
the same region as the “magnetic” electrons. Since they move around,
they can carry their prejudice for being upside down over to the next
atom; that is, one “magnetic” electron tries to force the conduction
electrons to be opposite, and the conduction electron then makes the
next “magnetic” electron opposite to <em class="emph">it</em>. The double
interaction is equivalent to an interaction which tries to line up the
two “magnetic” electrons. In other words, the tendency to make
parallel spins is the result of an intermediary that tends to some
extent to be opposite to both. This mechanism does not require that
the conduction electrons be completely “upside down.” They could
just have a slight prejudice to be down, just enough to load the
“magnetic” odds the other way. This is the mechanism that the people
who have calculated such things now believe is responsible for
ferromagnetism. But we must emphasize that to this day nobody can
calculate the magnitude of $\lambda$ simply by knowing that the
material is number $26$ in the periodic table. In short, we don’t
thoroughly understand it.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let us continue with the theory, and then come back later to
discuss a certain error involved in the way we have set it up. If the
magnetic moment of a certain electron is “up,” energy comes both
from the external field and also from the tendency of the spins to be
parallel. Since the energy is lower when the spins are parallel, the
effect is sometimes thought of as due to an “effective internal
field.” But remember, it is <em class="emph">not</em> due to a true <em class="emph">magnetic</em>
force; it is an interaction that is more complicated. In any case, we
take Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII371">37.1</a>) as the formulas for the energies of the
two spin states of a “magnetic” electron. At a temperature $T$, the
relative probability of these two states is proportional
to $e^{-\text{energy}/kT}$, which we can write as $e^{\pm x}$, with
$x=\mu(H+\lambda M/\epsO c^2)/kT$. Then, if we calculate the mean
value of the magnetic moment, we find (as in the last chapter) that it
is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:37:2}
M=N\mu\tanh x.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we would like to calculate the internal energy of the material. We
note that the energy of an electron is exactly proportional to the
magnetic moment, so that the calculation of the mean moment and the
calculation of the mean energy are the same—except that in place
of $\mu$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII372">37.2</a>) we would write $-\mu B$, which
is $-\mu(H+\lambda M/\epsO c^2)$. The mean energy is then
\begin{equation*}
\av{U} = -N\mu\biggl(H+
\frac{\lambda M}{\epsO c^2}\biggr)\tanh x.
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">Now this is not quite correct. The term $\lambda M/\epsO c^2$
represents interactions of all possible <em class="emph">pairs</em> of atoms, and we
must remember to count each pair only <em class="emph">once</em>. (When we consider
the energy of one electron in the field of the rest and then the
energy of a second electron in the field of the rest, we have counted
part of the first energy once more.) Thus, we must divide the
<em class="emph">mutual interaction term</em> by two, and our formula for the energy
then turns out to be
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:37:3}
\av{U} = -N\mu\biggl(H+
\frac{\lambda M}{2\epsO c^2}\biggr)\tanh x.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">In the last chapter we discovered an interesting thing—that below a
certain temperature the material finds a solution to the equations in
which the magnetic moment <em class="emph">is not zero</em>, even with no external
magnetizing field. When we set $H=0$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII372">37.2</a>), we
found that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:37:4}
\frac{M}{M_{\text{sat}}}=\tanh\biggl(\frac{T_c}{T}\,
\frac{M}{M_{\text{sat}}}\biggr),
\end{equation}

where $M_{\text{sat}}=N\mu$, and $T_c=\mu\lambda M_{\text{sat}}/k\epsO
c^2$. When we solve this equation (graphically or otherwise), we find
that the ratio $M/M_{\text{sat}}$ as a function of $T/T_c$ is a curve
like that labeled “quantum theory” in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F1">37–1</a>. The dashed curve
marked “cobalt, nickel” shows the experimental results for crystals
of these elements. The theory and experiment are in reasonably good
agreement. The figure also shows the result of the classical theory in
which the calculation is carried out assuming that the atomic magnets
can have all possible orientations in space. You can see that this
assumption gives a prediction that is not even close to the
experimental facts.</p>

<div id="Ch37-S1-p13" class="para">
<p class="p">Even the quantum theory deviates from the observed behavior at both
high and low temperatures. The reason for the deviations is that we
have made a rather sloppy approximation in the theory: We have assumed
that the energy of an atom depends upon the <em class="emph">mean</em> magnetization
of its neighboring atoms. In other words, for each one that is “up”
in the neighborhood of a given atom, there will be a contribution of
energy due to that quantum mechanical alignment effect.  But how many
are there pointed “up”? On the average, that is measured by the
magnetization $M$—but only <em class="emph">on the average</em>. A particular atom
somewhere might find <em class="emph">all</em> its neighbors “up.” Then its energy
will be larger than the average. Another one might find some up and
some down, perhaps averaging to zero, and it would have <em class="emph">no</em>
energy from that term, and so on. What we ought to do is to use some
more complicated kind of average, because the atoms in different
places have different environments, and the numbers up and down are
different for different ones. Instead of just taking one atom
subjected to the average influence, we should take each one in its
actual situation, compute its energy, and find the <em class="emph">average
energy</em>. But how do we find out how many are “up” and how many are
“down” in the neighborhood?  That is, of course, just what we are
trying to calculate—the number “up” and “down”—so we have a
very complicated interconnected problem of correlations, a problem
which has never been solved. It is an intriguing and exciting one
which has existed for years and on which some of the greatest names in
physics have written papers, but even they have not completely solved
it.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S1-p14" class="para">
<p class="p">It turns out that at low temperatures, when almost all the atomic
magnets are “up” and only a few are “down,” it is easy to solve;
and at high temperatures, far above the Curie temperature $T_c$ when
they are almost all random, it is again easy. It is often easy to
calculate small departures from some simple, idealized situation, so
it is fairly well understood why there are deviations from the simple
theory at low temperature. It is also understood physically that for
statistical reasons the magnetization <em class="emph">should</em> deviate at high
temperatures. But the exact behavior near the Curie point has never
been thoroughly figured out. That’s an interesting problem to work out
some day if you want a problem that has never been solved.</p>

<span class="tag">37–2</span>Thermodynamic properties</h3>
<div id="Ch37-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In the last chapter we laid the groundwork necessary for calculating the
thermodynamic properties of ferromagnetic materials. These are,
naturally, related to the internal energy of the crystal, which includes
interactions of the various spins, given by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII373">37.3</a>). For
the energy of the spontaneous magnetization below the Curie point, we
can set $H=0$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII373">37.3</a>), and—noticing that $\tanh
x=M/M_{\text{sat}}$—we find a mean energy proportional to $M^2$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:37:5}
\av{U} = -\frac{N\mu\lambda M^2}
{2\epsO c^2M_{\text{sat}}}.
\end{equation}

If we now plot the energy due to the magnetism as a function of
temperature, we get a curve which is the negative of the square of the
curve of Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F1">37–1</a>, as drawn in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F2">37–2</a>(a).
If we were to measure then the <em class="emph">specific heat</em> of such a material we would obtain a
curve which is the derivative of <a href="#Ch37-F2">37–2</a>(a). It is shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F2">37–2</a>(b). It rises slowly with increasing temperature,
but falls suddenly to zero at $T=T_c$. The sharp drop is due to the
change in slope of the magnetic energy and is reached right at the
Curie point. So without any magnetic measurements at all we
could have discovered that something was going on inside of iron or
nickel by measuring this thermodynamic property. However, both
experiment and improved theory (with fluctuations included) suggest that
this simple curve is wrong and that the true situation is really more
complicated. The curve goes higher at the peak and falls to zero
somewhat slowly. Even if the temperature is high enough to randomize the
spins <em class="emph">on the average</em>, there are still local regions where there
is a certain amount of polarization, and in these regions the spins
still have a little extra energy of interaction—which only dies out
slowly as things get more and more random with further increases in
temperature. So the actual curve looks like Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F2">37–2</a>(c).
One of the challenges of theoretical physics today is to find an exact
theoretical description of the character of the specific heat near the
Curie transition—an intriguing problem which has not yet been solved.
Naturally, this problem is very closely related to the shape of the
magnetization curve in the same region.</p>

<p class="p">Now we want to describe some experiments, other than thermodynamic
ones, which show that there is something <em class="emph">right</em> about our
interpretation of magnetism. When the material is magnetized to
saturation at low enough temperatures, $M$ is very nearly equal
to $M_{\text{sat}}$—nearly all the spins are parallel, as well as their
magnetic moments. We can check this by an experiment. Suppose we
suspend a bar magnet by a thin fiber and then surround it by a coil so
that we can reverse the magnetic field without touching the magnet or
putting any torque on it. This is a very difficult experiment because
the magnetic forces are so enormous that any irregularities, any
lopsidedness, or any lack of perfection in the iron will produce
accidental torques. However, the experiment has been done under
careful conditions in which such accidental torques are minimized. By
means of the magnetic field from a coil that surrounds the bar, we
turn all the atomic magnets over at once. When we do this we also
change the angular momenta of all the spins from “up” to “down”
(see Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F3">37–3</a>). If angular momentum is to be conserved when the
spins all turn over, the rest of the bar must have an opposite change
in angular momentum. The whole magnet will start to spin. And sure
enough, when we do the experiment, we find a slight turning of the
magnet. We can measure the total angular momentum given to the whole
magnet, and this is simply $N$ times $\hbar$, the change in the
angular momentum of each spin. The ratio of angular momentum to
magnetic moment measured this way comes out to within about
$10$ percent of what we calculate. Actually, our calculations assume that
the atomic magnets are due purely to the electron spin, but there is,
in addition, some orbital motion also in most materials. The orbital
motion is not completely free of the lattice and does not contribute
much more than a few percent to the magnetism. As a matter of fact,
the saturation magnetic field that one gets taking
$M_{\text{sat}}=N\mu$ and using the density of iron of $7.9$ and the
moment $\mu$ of the spinning electron is about $20{,}000$ gauss. But
according to experiment, it is actually in the neighborhood
of $21{,}500$ gauss. This is a typical magnitude of error—$5$ or
$10$ percent—due to neglecting the contributions of the orbital moments
that have not been included in making the analysis. Thus, a slight
discrepancy with the gyromagnetic measurements is quite
understandable.</p>

<p class="p">We have concluded from our theoretical analysis that a ferromagnetic
material should spontaneously become magnetized below a certain
temperature so that all the magnetism would be in the same
direction. But we know that this is not true for an ordinary piece of
<em class="emph">unmagnetized</em> iron. Why isn’t all iron magnetized? We can
explain it with the help of Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F4">37–4</a>. Suppose the iron were all a
big single crystal of the shape shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F4">37–4</a>(a) and
spontaneously magnetized all in one direction. Then there would be a
considerable external magnetic field, which would have a lot of
energy. We can reduce that field energy if we arrange that one side of
the block is magnetized “up” and the other side magnetized “down,”
as in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F4">37–4</a>(b). Then, of course, the fields outside the iron
would extend over less volume, so there would be less energy there.</p>

<div id="Ch37-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Ah, but wait! In the layer between the two regions we have up-spinning
electrons adjacent to down-spinning electrons. But ferromagnetism
appears only in those materials for which the energy is <em class="emph">reduced</em>
if the electrons are <em class="emph">parallel</em> rather than opposite. So, we have
added some extra energy along the dotted line in
Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F4">37–4</a>(b); this energy is sometimes called <em class="emph">wall
energy</em>. A region having
only one direction of magnetization is called a
<em class="emph">domain</em>. At the interface—the “wall”—between
two domains, where we have atoms on opposite sides which are spinning in
different directions, there is an energy per unit area of the wall. We
have described it as though two adjacent atoms were spinning exactly
opposite, but it turns out that nature adjusts things so that the
transition is more gradual. But we don’t need to worry about such fine
details at this point.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S3-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Now the question is: When is it better or worse to make a wall? The
answer is that it depends on the <em class="emph">size</em> of the domains. Suppose
that we were to scale up a block so that the whole thing was twice as
big. The volume in the space outside filled with a given magnetic field
strength would be <em class="emph">eight</em> times bigger, and the energy in the
magnetic field, which is proportional to the volume, would also be eight
times greater. But the <em class="emph">surface</em> area between two domains, which
will give the wall energy,
would be only <em class="emph">four</em> times as big. Therefore, if the piece of iron
is big enough, it will pay to split it into more domains. This is why
only the very tiny crystals can have but a single domain. Any large
object—one more than about a hundredth of a millimeter in size—will
have at least one domain wall; and any ordinary, “centimeter-size”
object will be split into many domains, as shown in the figure.
Splitting into domains goes on <em class="emph">until the energy needed to put in
one extra wall is as large as the energy decrease in the magnetic field
outside the crystal</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S3-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Actually nature has discovered still another way to lower the energy: It
is not necessary to have the field go outside at all, if a little
triangular region is magnetized <em class="emph">sideways</em>, as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F4">37–4</a>(d).<a name="footnote_source_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup class="mark">3</sup></a> Then
with the arrangement of Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F4">37–4</a>(d) we see that there is
<em class="emph">no</em> external field, but instead only a little more domain wall.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">But that introduces a new kind of problem. It turns out that when a
single crystal of iron is magnetized, it changes its length in the
direction of magnetization, so an “ideal” cube with its magnetization,
say, “up,” is no longer a perfect cube. The “vertical” dimension
will be different from the “horizontal” dimension. This effect is
called <em class="emph">magnetostriction</em>. Because of such
geometric changes, the little triangular pieces of
Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F4">37–4</a>(d) do not, so to speak, “fit” into the
available space anymore—the crystal has got too long one way and too
short the other way. Of course, it <em class="emph">does</em> fit, really, but only by
being squashed in; and this involves some mechanical stresses. So, this
arrangement <em class="emph">also</em> introduces an extra energy. It is the balance of
all these various energies which determines how the domains finally
arrange themselves in their complicated fashion in a piece of
unmagnetized iron.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Now, what happens when we put on an external magnetic field? To take a
simple case, consider a crystal whose domains are as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F4">37–4</a>(d). If we apply an external magnetic field in the
upward direction, in what manner does the crystal become magnetized?
First, the middle domain wall can <em class="emph">move over sideways</em> (to the
right) and reduce the energy. It moves over so that the region which is
“up” becomes bigger than the region which is “down.” There are more
elementary magnets lined up with the field, and this gives a lower
energy. So, for a piece of iron in weak fields—at the very beginning
of magnetization—the domain walls begin to move and eat into the
regions which are magnetized opposite to the field. As the field
continues to increase, a whole crystal shifts gradually into a single
large domain which the external field helps to keep lined up. In a
strong field the crystal “likes” to be all one way <em class="emph">just because</em>
its energy in the applied field is reduced—it is no longer merely the
crystal’s own external field which matters.</p>

<p class="p">What if the geometry is not so simple? What if the axes of the crystal
and its spontaneous magnetization are in one direction, but we apply
the magnetic field in <em class="emph">some other direction</em>—say at $45^\circ$?
We might think that domains would reform themselves with their
magnetization parallel to the field, and then as before, they could
all grow into one domain. But this is not easy for the iron to do,
<em class="emph">for the energy needed to magnetize a crystal depends on the
direction of magnetization relative to the crystal axis</em>. It is
relatively easy to magnetize iron in a direction parallel to the
crystal axes, but it takes <em class="emph">more</em> energy to magnetize it in some
other direction—like $45^\circ$ with respect to one of the
axes. Therefore, if we apply a magnetic field in such a direction,
what happens first is that the domains which point along one of the
preferred directions which is <em class="emph">near</em> to the applied field grow
until the magnetization is all along one of these directions. Then
<em class="emph">with much stronger fields</em>, the magnetization is gradually
pulled around parallel to the field, as sketched in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F5">37–5</a>.</p>

<p class="p">In Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F6">37–6</a> are shown some observations of the
magnetization curves of single crystals of iron. To understand them, we
must first explain something about the notation that is used in
describing directions in a crystal. There are many ways in which a
crystal can be sliced so as to produce a face which is a plane of atoms.
Everyone who has driven past an orchard or vineyard knows this—it is
fascinating to watch. If you look one way, you see lines of trees—if
you look another way, you see different lines of trees, and so on. In a
similar way, a crystal has definite families of planes that hold many
atoms, and the planes have this important characteristic (we consider a
cubic crystal to make it easier): If we observe where the planes
intersect the three coordinate axes—we find that the
<em class="emph">reciprocals</em> of the three distances from the origin are in the
ratio of simple whole numbers. These three whole numbers are taken as
the definition of the planes. For example, in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F7">37–7</a>(a),
a plane parallel to the $yz$-plane is shown. This is called a
$[100]$ plane; the reciprocals of its intersection of the $y$- and $z$-axes are
both zero. The direction perpendicular to such a plane (in a cubic
crystal) is given the same set of numbers. It is easy to understand the
idea in a cubic crystal, for then the indices $[100]$ mean a vector
which has a unit component in the $x$-direction and none in the $y$-
or $z$-directions. The $[110]$ direction is in a direction $45^\circ$ from
the $x$- and $y$-axes, as in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F7">37–7</a>(b); and the
$[111]$ direction is in the direction of the cube diagonal, as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F7">37–7</a>(c).</p>

<p class="p">Returning now to Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F6">37–6</a>, we see the magnetization curves
of a single crystal of iron for various directions. First, note that for
very tiny fields—so weak that it is hard to see them on the scale at
all—the magnetization increases extremely rapidly to quite large
values. If the field is in the $[100]$ direction—namely along one of
those nice, easy directions of magnetization—the curve goes up to a
high value, curves around a little, and then is saturated. What happened
is that the domains which were already there are very easily removed.
Only a small field is required to make the domain walls move and eat up
all of the “wrong-way” domains. Single crystals of iron are enormously
permeable (magnetic sense), much more so than ordinary polycrystalline
iron. A perfect crystal magnetizes extremely easily. Why is it curved at
all? Why doesn’t it just go right up to saturation? We are not sure. You
might study that some day. We do understand why it is flat for high
fields. When the whole block is a single domain, the extra magnetic
field cannot make any more magnetization—it is already
at $M_{\text{sat}}$, with all the electrons lines up.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S3-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Now, if we try to do the same thing in the $[110]$ direction—which
is at $45^\circ$ to the crystal axes—what will happen? We turn on a
little bit of field and the magnetization leaps up as the domains
grow. Then as we increase the field some more, we find that it takes
quite a lot of field to get up to saturation, because now the
magnetization is <em class="emph">turning away</em> from an “easy” direction. If
this explanation is correct, the point at which the $[110]$ curve
extrapolates back to the vertical axis should be at $1/\sqrt{2}$ of
the saturation value. It turns out, in fact, to be very, very close
to $1/\sqrt{2}$. Similarly, in the $[111]$ direction—which is along the
cube diagonal—we find, as we would expect, that the curve
extrapolates back to nearly $1/\sqrt{3}$ of saturation.</p>

<p class="p">Figure <a href="#Ch37-F8">37–8</a> shows the corresponding situation for two other
materials, nickel and cobalt. Nickel is different from iron. In nickel,
it turns out that the $[111]$ direction is the easy direction of
magnetization. Cobalt has a hexagonal crystal form, and people have
botched up the system of nomenclature for this case. They want to have
three axes on the bottom of the hexagon and one perpendicular to these,
so they have used four indices. The $[0001]$ direction is the direction
of the axis of the hexagon, and $[1010]$ is perpendicular to that axis.
We see that crystals of different metals behave in different ways.</p>

<p class="p">Now we must discuss a polycrystalline material, such as an ordinary
piece of iron. Inside such materials there are many, many little
crystals with their crystalline axes pointing every which way.
<em class="emph">These are not the same as domains</em>. Remember that the domains were
all part of a <em class="emph">single crystal</em>, but in a piece of iron there are
many <em class="emph">different crystals</em> with axes at different orientations, as
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F9">37–9</a>. Within each of these crystals, there
will also generally be some domains. When we apply a <em class="emph">small</em>
magnetic field to a piece of polycrystalline material, what happens is
that the domain walls begin to move, and the domains which have a
favorable direction of easy magnetization grow larger. This growth is
reversible so long as the field stays very small—if we turn the field
off, the magnetization will return to zero. This part of the
magnetization curve is marked $a$ in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F10">37–10</a>.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch37-S3-p13" class="para">
<p class="p">For larger fields—in the region $b$ of the magnetization curve
shown—things get much more complicated. In every small crystal of
the material, there are strains and dislocations; there are
impurities, dirt, and imperfections. And at all but the smallest
fields, the domain wall, in moving, gets stuck on these. There is an
interaction energy between the domain wall and a dislocation, or a
grain boundary, or an impurity. So when the wall gets to one of them,
it gets stuck; it sticks there at a certain field. But then if the
field is raised some more, the wall suddenly snaps past. So the motion
of the domain wall is not smooth the way it is in a perfect
crystal—it gets hung up every once in a while and moves in jerks. If
we were to look at the magnetization on a microscopic scale, we would
see something like the insert of Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F10">37–10</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S3-p14" class="para">
<p class="p">Now the important thing is that these jerks in the magnetization can
cause an energy loss. In the first place, when a boundary finally
slips past an impediment, it moves very quickly to the next one, since
the field is already above what would be required for the unimpeded
motion. The rapid motion means that there are rapidly changing
magnetic fields which produce eddy currents in the crystal. These
currents lose energy in heating the metal. A second effect is that
when a domain suddenly changes, part of the crystal changes its
dimensions from the magnetostriction. Each sudden shift of a domain
wall sets up a little sound wave that carries away energy. Because of
such effects, the second part of magnetization curve is
<em class="emph">irreversible</em>, and <em class="emph">there is energy being lost</em>. This is
the origin of the hysteresis effect, because to move a boundary wall
forward—snap—and then to move it backward—snap—produces a
different result. It’s like “jerky” friction, and it takes energy.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S3-p15" class="para">
<p class="p">Eventually, for high enough fields, when we have moved all the domain
walls and magnetized each crystal in its best direction, there are
still some crystallites which happen to have their easy directions of
magnetization not in the direction of our external magnetic
field. Then it takes a lot of extra field to turn those magnetic
moments around. So the magnetization increases slowly, but smoothly,
for high fields—namely in the region marked $c$ in the figure. The
magnetization does not come sharply to its saturation value, because
in the last part of the curve the atomic magnets are <em class="emph">turning</em> in
the strong field. So we see why the magnetization curve of an ordinary
polycrystalline materials, such as the one shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F10">37–10</a>,
rises a little bit and <em class="emph">reversibly</em> at first, then rises
irreversibly, and then curves over slowly. Of course, there is no
sharp break-point between the three regions—they blend smoothly, one
into the other.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S3-p16" class="para">
<p class="p">It is not hard to show that the magnetization process in the middle
part of the magnetization curve is jerky—that the domain walls jerk
and snap as they shift. All you need is a coil of wire—with many
thousands of turns—connected to an amplifier and a loudspeaker, as
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F11">37–11</a>. If you put a few silicon steel sheets (of the
type used in transformers) at the center of the coil and bring a bar
magnet slowly near the stack, the sudden changes in magnetization will
produce impulses of emf in the coil, which are heard as distinct
clicks in the loudspeaker. As you move the magnet nearer to the iron
you will hear a whole rush of clicks that sound something like the
noise of sand grains falling over each other as a can of sand is tilted.
The domain walls are jumping, snapping, and jiggling as the field is
increased. This phenomenon is called the
<em class="emph">Barkhausen effect</em>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S3-p17" class="para">
<p class="p">As you move the magnet even closer to the iron sheets, the noise grows
louder and louder for a while but then there is relatively little
noise when the magnet gets very close. Why? Because nearly all the
domain walls have moved as far as they can go. Any greater field is
merely <em class="emph">turning</em> the magnetization in each domain, which is a
smooth process.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S3-p18" class="para">
<p class="p">If you now withdraw the magnet, so as to come back on the downward
branch of the hysteresis loop, the domains all try to get back to low
energy again, and you hear another rush of backward-going jerks. You
can also note that if you bring the magnet to a given place and move
it back and forth a little bit, there is relatively little noise. It
is again like tilting a can of sand—once the grains shift into
place, small movements of the can don’t disturb them. In the iron the
small variations in the magnetic field aren’t enough to move any
boundaries over any of the “humps.”</p>

<span class="tag">37–4</span>Ferromagnetic materials</h3>
<div id="Ch37-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we would like to talk about the various kinds of magnetic
materials that there are in the technical world and to consider some
of the problems involved in designing magnetic materials for different
purposes. First, the term “the magnetic properties of iron,” which
one often hears, is a misnomer—there is no such thing. “Iron” is
not a well-defined material—the properties of iron depend critically
on the amount of impurities and also on <em class="emph">how</em> the iron is
formed. You can appreciate that the magnetic properties will depend on
how easily the domain walls move and that this is a <em class="emph">gross</em>
property, not a property of the individual atoms. So practical
ferromagnetism is not really a property of an iron <em class="emph">atom</em>—it is
a property of <em class="emph">solid iron</em> in a <em class="emph">certain form</em>. For example,
iron can take on two different crystalline forms. The common form has
a body-centered cubic lattice, but it can also have a face-centered
cubic lattice, which is, however, stable only at temperatures
above $1100^\circ$C. Of course, at that temperature the body-centered cubic
structure is already past the Curie point. However, by alloying
chromium and nickel with the iron (one possible mixture is
$18$ percent chromium and $8$ percent nickel) we can get what is called
stainless steel, which, although it is mainly iron, retains the
face-centered lattice even at low temperatures. Because its crystal
structure is different, it has completely different magnetic
properties. Most kinds of stainless steel are not magnetic to any
appreciable degree, although there are some kinds which are somewhat
magnetic—it depends on the composition of the alloy. Even when such
an alloy is magnetic, it is not <em class="emph">ferro</em>magnetic like ordinary
iron—even though it is mostly just iron.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We would like now to describe a few of the special materials which
have been developed for their particular magnetic properties. First,
if we want to make a <em class="emph">permanent</em> magnet, we would like material
with an enormously <em class="emph">wide</em> hysteresis loop so that, when we turn
the current off and come down to zero magnetizing field, the
magnetization will remain large. For such materials the domain
boundaries should be “frozen” in place as much as possible. One such
material is the remarkable alloy “Alnico V” ($51\%$ Fe, $8\%$ Al,
$14\%$ Ni, $24\%$ Co, $3\%$ Cu). (The rather complex composition of
this alloy is indicative of the kind of detailed effort that has gone
into making good magnets. What patience it takes to mix five things
together and test them until you find the most ideal substance!) When
Alnico solidifies, there is a “second phase” which precipitates out,
making many tiny grains and very high internal strains. In this
material, the domain boundaries have a hard time moving at all. In
addition to having a precise composition, Alnico is mechanically
“worked” in a way that makes the crystals appear in the form of long
grains along the direction in which the magnetization is going to
be. Then the magnetization will have a natural tendency to be lined up
in these directions and will be held there from the anisotropic
effects. Furthermore, the material is even cooled in an external
magnetic field when it is manufactured, so that the grains will grow
with the right crystal orientation. The hysteresis loop of
Alnico V is shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F12">37–12</a>. You see that it is
about $700$ times wider than the hysteresis curve for soft iron that we
showed in the last chapter in Fig. <a href="II_36.html#Ch36-F8">36–8</a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s turn now to a different kind of material. For building
transformers and motors, we want a material which is magnetically
“soft”—one in which the magnetism is easily changed so that an
enormous amount of magnetization results from a very small applied
field. To arrange this, we need pure, well-annealed material which
will have very few dislocations and impurities so that the domain
walls can move easily. It would also be nice if we could make the
anisotropy small. Then, even if a grain of the material sits at the
wrong angle with respect to the field, it will still magnetize
easily. Now we have said that iron prefers to magnetize along the
$[100]$ direction, whereas nickel prefers the $[111]$ direction; so if
we mix iron and nickel in various proportions, we might hope to find
that with just the right proportions the alloy wouldn’t prefer
<em class="emph">any</em> direction—the $[100]$ and $[111]$ directions would be
equivalent. It turns out that this happens with a mixture of
$70$ percent nickel and $30$ percent iron. In addition—possibly by luck
or maybe because of some physical relationship between the anisotropy
and the magnetostriction effects—it turns out
that the <em class="emph">magnetostriction</em> of iron and nickel has the opposite
sign. And in an alloy of the two metals, this property goes through zero
at about $80$ percent nickel. So somewhere between $70$ and $80$ percent
nickel we get very “soft” magnetic materials—alloys that are very
easy to magnetize. They are called the
<em class="emph">permalloys</em>. Permalloys are
useful for high-quality transformers (at low signal levels), but they
would be no good at all for permanent magnets.
Permalloys must be very carefully made and handled. The
magnetic properties of a piece of permalloy are
drastically changed if it is stressed beyond its elastic limit—it
mustn’t be bent. Then, its permeability is reduced because of the
dislocations, slip bands, and so on, which are produced by the
mechanical deformations. The domain boundaries are no longer easy to
move. The high permeability can, however, be restored by annealing at
high temperatures.

<p class="p">We would now like to discuss some of the more exotic magnetic materials.
There are many elements in the periodic table which have incomplete
inner electron shells and hence have atomic magnetic moments. For
instance, right next to the ferromagnetic elements iron, nickel, and
cobalt you will find chromium and manganese. Why aren’t <em class="emph">they</em>
ferromagnetic? The answer is that the $\lambda$ term in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII371">37.1</a>) has the <em class="emph">opposite sign</em> for these elements.
In the chromium lattice, for example, the spins of the chromium atoms
alternate <em class="emph">atom by atom</em>, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F13">37–13</a>(b).
So chromium <em class="emph">is</em> “magnetic” from its own point of view, but it is
not technically interesting because there are no <em class="emph">external</em>
magnetic effects. Chromium, then, is an example of a material in which
quantum mechanical effects make the spins alternate. Such a material is
called <em class="emph">antiferromagnetic</em>. The
alignment in antiferromagnetic materials is also temperature dependent.
Below a critical temperature, all the spins are lined up in the
alternating array, but when the material is heated above a certain
temperature—which is again called the Curie temperature—the
spins suddenly become random. There is, internally, a sudden transition.
This transition can be seen in the specific heat curve. Also it shows up
in some special “magnetic” effects. For instance, the existence of the
alternating spins can be verified by scattering neutrons from a crystal
of chromium. Because a neutron itself has a spin (and a magnetic
moment), it has a different amplitude to be scattered, depending on
whether its spin is parallel or opposite to the spin of the scatterer.
Thus, we get a different interference pattern when the spins in a
crystal are alternating than we do when they have a random distribution.</p>

<p class="p">There is another kind of substance in which quantum mechanical effects
make the electron spins alternate, but which is nevertheless
<em class="emph">ferromagnetic</em>—that is, the crystal has a permanent net
magnetization. The idea behind such materials is shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F14">37–14</a>. The figure shows the crystal structure of
<em class="emph">spinel</em>, a magnesium-aluminum oxide,
which—as it is shown—is <em class="emph">not</em> magnetic. The oxide has two kinds
of metal atoms: magnesium and aluminum. Now if we replace the magnesium
and the aluminum by two magnetic elements like iron and zinc, or by zinc
and manganese—in other words, if we put in <em class="emph">magnetic</em> atoms
instead of the nonmagnetic ones—an interesting thing happens. Let’s
call one kind of metal atom $a$ and the other kind of metal atom $b$;
then the following combination of forces must be considered. There is an
$a$-$b$ interaction which tries to make the $a$ atoms and the $b$ atoms
have opposite spins—because quantum mechanics always gives the
opposite sign (except for the mysterious crystals of iron, nickel, and
cobalt). Then, there is a direct $a$-$a$ interaction which tries to make
the $a$’s opposite, and also a $b$-$b$ interaction which tries to make
the $b$’s opposite. Now, of course we cannot have everything opposite
everything else—$a$ opposite $b$, $a$ opposite $a$, and $b$
opposite $b$. Presumably because of the distances between the $a$’s and the
presence of the oxygen (although we really don’t know why), it turns out
that the $a$-$b$ interaction is stronger than the $a$-$a$ or
the $b$-$b$. So the solution that nature uses in this case is to make all
the $a$’s <em class="emph">parallel to each other</em>, and all the $b$’s
<em class="emph">parallel to each other</em>, but the two systems <em class="emph">opposite</em>. That
gives the lowest energy because of the stronger $a$-$b$ interaction. The
result: all the $a$’s are spinning up and all the $b$’s are spinning
down—or vice versa, of course. But if the <em class="emph">magnetic moments</em> of
the $a$-type atom and the $b$-type atom <em class="emph">are not equal</em>, we can get
the situation shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F13">37–13</a>(c), and there can be a
net magnetization in the material. The material will then be
ferromagnetic—although somewhat weak. Such materials are called
<em class="emph">ferrites</em>. They do not have as high a saturation magnetization as
iron—for obvious reasons—so they are only useful for smaller fields.
But they have a very important difference—they are insulators; the
ferrites are <em class="emph">ferromagnetic
insulators</em>. In high-frequency fields,
they will have very small eddy currents and so can be used, for example,
in microwave systems. The microwave fields will be able to get inside
such an insulating material, whereas they would be kept out by the eddy
currents in a conductor like iron.</p>

<div id="Ch37-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">There is another class of magnetic materials which has only recently
been discovered—members of the family of the orthosilicates called
<em class="emph">garnets</em>. They are again crystals in which the lattice contains
two kinds of metallic atoms, and we have again a situation in which two
kinds of atoms can be substituted almost at will. Among the many
compounds of interest there is one which is completely ferromagnetic. It
has yttrium and iron in the garnet structure, and the reason it is
ferromagnetic is very curious. Here again quantum mechanics is making
the neighboring spins opposite, so that there is a locked-in system of
spins with the electron spins of the iron one way and the electron spins
of the yttrium the opposite way. But the yttrium atom is complicated. It
is a rare-earth element and gets a large contribution to its magnetic
moment from <em class="emph">orbital</em> motion of the electrons. For yttrium, the
orbital motion contribution is <em class="emph">opposite</em> that of the spin and also
is bigger. Thus, although quantum mechanics, working through the
exclusion principle, makes the <em class="emph">spins</em> of the yttrium opposite
those of the iron, it makes the <em class="emph">total</em> magnetic moment of the
yttrium atom <em class="emph">parallel</em> to the iron because of the orbital
effect—as sketched in Fig. <a href="#Ch37-F13">37–13</a>(d). The compound is
therefore a regular ferromagnet.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch37-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Another interesting example of ferromagnetism occurs in some of the
rare-earth elements. It has to do with a still more peculiar
arrangement of the spins. The material is not ferromagnetic in the
sense that the spins are all parallel, nor is it antiferromagnetic in
the sense that every atom is opposite. In these crystals all of the
spins <em class="emph">in one layer</em> are parallel and lie in the plane of the
layer. In the next layer all spins are again parallel to each other,
but point in a somewhat different direction. In the following layer
they are in still another direction, and so on. The result is that the
local magnetization vector varies in the form of a spiral—the
magnetic moments of the successive layers rotate as we proceed along a
line perpendicular to the layers. It is interesting to try to analyze
what happens when a field is applied to such a spiral—all the
twistings and turnings that must go on in all those atomic
magnets. (Some people <em class="emph">like</em> to amuse themselves with the theory
of these things!) Not only are there cases of “flat” spirals, but
there are also cases in which the directions the magnetic moments of
successive layers map out a cone, so that it has a spiral component
and also a uniform ferromagnetic component in one direction!</p>

<p class="p">The magnetic properties of materials, worked out on a more advanced
level than we have been able to do here, have fascinated physicists of
all kinds. In the first place, there are those practical people who love
to work out ways of making things in a better way—they love to design
better and more interesting magnetic materials. The discovery of things
like ferrites, or their application, immediately
delights people who like to see clever new ways of doing things. Besides
this, there are those who find a fascination in the terrible complexity
that nature can produce using a few basic laws. Starting with one and
the same general idea, nature goes from the ferromagnetism of iron and
its domains, to the antiferromagnetism of chromium, to the magnetism of
ferrites and garnets, to the spiral
structure of the rare earth elements, and on, and on. It is fascinating
to discover experimentally all the strange things that go on in these
special substances. Then, to the theoretical physicists, ferromagnetism
presents a number of very interesting, unsolved, and beautiful
challenges. One challenge is to understand why it exists at all. Another
is to predict the statistics of the interacting spins in an ideal
lattice. Even neglecting any possible extraneous complications, this
problem has, so far, defied full understanding. The reason that it is so
interesting is that it is such an easily stated problem: Given a lot of
electron spins in a regular lattice, interacting with such-and-such a
law, what do they do? It is simply stated, but it has defied complete
analysis for years. Although it has been analyzed rather carefully for
temperatures not too close to the Curie point, the theory of the
sudden transition at the Curie point still needs to be
completed.

<p class="p">Finally, the whole subject of the system of spinning atomic
magnets—in ferromagnetic, or in paramagnetic materials and in
nuclear magnetism, has also been a fascinating thing to advanced
students in physics. The system of spins can be pushed on and pulled
on with external magnetic fields, so one can do many tricks with
resonances, with relaxation effects, with spin-echoes, and with other
effects. It serves as a prototype of many complicated thermodynamic
systems. But in paramagnetic materials the situation is often fairly
simple, and people have been delighted both to do experiments and to
explain the phenomena theoretically.</p>

<p class="p">We now close our study of electricity and magnetism. In the first
chapter, we spoke of the great strides that have been made since the
early Greek observation of the strange behaviors of amber
and of lodestone. Yet in all our long and involved
discussion we have never explained <em class="emph">why it is that when we rub a
piece of amber we get a charge on it</em>, nor have we
explained <em class="emph">why a lodestone is magnetized!</em>  You
may say, “Oh, we just didn’t get the right sign.”  No, it is worse
than that. Even if we <em class="emph">did</em> get the right sign, we would still have
the question: Why is the piece of lodestone in the
ground magnetized?  There is the earth’s magnetic field, of course, but
<em class="emph">where does the earth’s field come from</em>?  Nobody really
knows—there have only been some good guesses. So you see, this physics
of ours is a lot of fakery—we start out with the phenomena of
lodestone and amber, and we end up not
understanding either of them very well. But we <em class="emph">have</em> learned a
tremendous amount of very exciting and very practical information in the
process!</p>

  We write these

of the last chapter. You might prefer to write $U=\pm\mu
B_a=\pm\mu(B+\lambda'M/\epsO c^2)$, where $\lambda'=\lambda-1$. It’s
the same thing.

  You may be wondering how spins that
have to be either “up” or “down” can also be “sideways”! That’s a
good question, but we won’t worry about it right now. We’ll simply adopt
the classical point of view, thinking of the atomic magnets as classical
dipoles which can be polarized sideways. Quantum mechanics requires
considerable expertness to understand how things can be quantized both
“up-and-down,” and “right-and-left,” all at the same time.
