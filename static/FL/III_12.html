<span class="tag">12–1</span>Base states for a system with two spin one-half particles</h3>

<div id="Ch12-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In this chapter we take up the “hyperfine splitting” of hydrogen,
because it is a physically interesting example of what we can already
do with quantum mechanics. It’s an example with more than two states,
and it will be illustrative of the methods of quantum mechanics as
applied to slightly more complicated problems. It is enough more
complicated that once you see how this one is handled you can get
immediately the generalization to all kinds of problems.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">As you know, the hydrogen atom consists of an electron sitting in the
neighborhood of the proton, where it can exist in any one of a number
of discrete energy states in each one of which the pattern of motion
of the electron is different. The first excited state, for example,
lies $3/4$ of a Rydberg, or about $10$ electron volts, above the
ground state. But even the so-called ground state of hydrogen is not
really a single, definite-energy state, because of the spins of the
electron and the proton. These spins are responsible for the
“hyperfine structure” in the energy levels, which splits all the
energy levels into several nearly equal levels.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The electron can have its spin either “up” or “down” and, the
proton can also have <em class="emph">its</em> spin either “up” or “down.” There
are, therefore, <em class="emph">four</em> possible spin states for every dynamical
condition of the atom. That is, when people say “the ground state”
of hydrogen, they really mean the “four ground states,” and not just
the very lowest state. The four spin states do not all have exactly
the same energy; there are slight shifts from the energies we would
expect with no spins. The shifts are, however, much, much smaller than
the $10$ electron volts or so from the ground state to the next state above. As
a consequence, each dynamical state has its energy split into a set of
very close energy levels—the so-called <em class="emph">hyperfine splitting</em>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">The energy differences among the four spin states is what we want to
calculate in this chapter. The hyperfine splitting is due to the
interaction of the magnetic moments of the electron and proton, which
gives a slightly different magnetic energy for each spin state. These
energy shifts are only about ten-millionths of an electron
volt—really very small compared with $10$ electron volts! It is because of
this large gap that we can think about the ground state of hydrogen as
a “four-state” system, without worrying about the fact that there
are really many more states at higher energies. We are going to limit
ourselves here to a study of the hyperfine structure of the ground
state of the hydrogen atom.

<div id="Ch12-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">For our purposes we are not interested in any of the details about the

worked out by the atom so to speak—it has worked itself out by

electron and proton in the neighborhood of each other with some
definite spatial relationship. In addition, they can have various
different relative orientations of their spins. It is only the effect

<p class="p">The first question we have to answer is: What are the <em class="emph">base

incorrectly. There is no such thing as “<em class="emph">the</em>” base states,
because, of course, the set of base states you may choose is not
unique. New sets can always be made out of linear combinations of the
old. There are always many choices for the base states, and among
them, any choice is equally legitimate. So the question is not what is
<em class="emph">the</em> base set, but what <em class="emph">could</em> a base set be? We can
choose any one we wish for our own convenience. It is usually best to
start with a base set which is <em class="emph">physically</em> the clearest. It may
not be the solution to any problem, or may not have any <em class="emph">direct</em>
importance, but it will generally make it easier to understand what is
going on.

We need a handy notation for these four states, so we’ll represent them this way:
\begin{equation}

<p class="p">You may say, “But the particles interact, and maybe these aren’t the
right base states. It sounds as though you are considering the two
particles independently.” Yes, indeed! The interaction raises the
problem: what is the <em class="emph">Hamiltonian</em> for the system, but the
interaction is not involved in the question of how to <em class="emph">describe</em>
the system. What we choose for the base states has nothing to do with
what happens next. It may be that the atom cannot ever <em class="emph">stay</em> in
one of these base states, even if it is started that way. That’s
another question. That’s the question: How do the amplitudes change
with time in a particular (fixed) base? In choosing the base states,
we are just choosing the “unit vectors” for our description.

<div id="Ch12-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">While we’re on the subject, let’s look at the general problem of
finding a set of base states when there is more than one particle. You
know the base states for a single particle. An electron, for example,
is completely described in real life—not in our simplified cases,
but in real life—by giving the amplitudes to be in each of the
following states:
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\text{electron “up” with momentum $\FLPp$}}
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\text{electron “down” with momentum $\FLPp$}}.
\end{equation*}
There are really two infinite sets of states, one state for each value
of $\FLPp$. That is to say that an electron state $\ket{\psi}$ is
completely described if you know all the amplitudes
\begin{equation*}
\braket{+,\FLPp}{\psi}\quad
\text{and}\quad
\braket{-,\FLPp}{\psi},
\end{equation*}
where the $+$ and $-$ represent the components of angular momentum
along some axis—usually the $z$-axis—and $\FLPp$ is the vector
momentum. There must, therefore, be two amplitudes for every possible
momentum (a multi-infinite set of base states). That is all there is
to describing a single particle.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">When there is more than one particle, the base states can be written
in a similar way. For instance, if there were an electron and a proton
in a more complicated situation than we are considering, the base
states could be of the following kind:
\begin{align*}
|\,&\text{electron spin “up” with momentum $\FLPp_1$},\\[.5ex]
&\text{proton spin “down” with momentum $\FLPp_2$}\rangle.
\end{align*}
And so on for other spin combinations. If there are more than two
particles—same idea. So you see that to write down the
<em class="emph">possible</em> base states is really very easy. The only problem is,
what is the Hamiltonian?

</div>

<div id="Ch12-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">For our study of the ground state of hydrogen we don’t need to use the
full sets of base states for the various momenta. We are specifying
particular momentum states for the proton and electron when we say

that is another problem. Now we are concerned only with the effects of
the spin, so we can take only the four base states
of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII121">12.1</a>). Our next problem is: What is the Hamiltonian for

<p class="p">We’ll tell you in a moment what it is. But first, we should remind you
of one thing: <em class="emph">any</em> state can always be written as a linear
combination of the base states. For any state $\ket{\psi}$ we can
write
\begin{align}
\ket{\psi}=\phantom{+}&\ket{+\,+}\braket{+\,+}{\psi}\,+\,\ket{+\,-}\braket{+\,-}{\psi}\notag\\[.5ex]
\label{Eq:III:12:2}

$3$, or $4$, and write Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII122">12.2</a>) as

<div id="Ch12-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">You will remember that in the last chapter we were able to describe
the Hamiltonian of a single, spin one-half particle by using the sigma
matrices—or the exactly equivalent sigma operators. The properties
of the operators are summarized in Table <a href="#Ch12-T1">12-1</a>. These
operators—which are just a convenient, shorthand way of keeping
track of the matrix elements of the
type $\bracket{+}{\sigma_z}{+}$—were useful for describing the behavior
of a <em class="emph">single</em> particle of spin one-half. The question is: Can we
find an analogous device to describe a system with two spins? The
answer is yes, very simply, as follows. We invent a thing which we
will call “sigma electron,” which we represent
by the vector operator $\FLPsigmae$, and which has the $x$-, $y$-,
and $z$-components, $\sigmae_x$, $\sigmae_y$, $\sigmae_z$. We now make
the <em class="emph">convention</em> that when one of these things operates on any one
of our four base states of the hydrogen atom, it acts only on the
<em class="emph">electron</em> spin, and in exactly the same way as if the electron
were all by itself. Example: What is $\sigmae_y\,\ket{-\,+}$? Since
$\sigma_y$ on an electron “down” is $-i$ times the corresponding state
with the electron “up”,
\begin{equation*}
\sigmae_y\,\ket{-\,+}=-i\,\ket{+\,+}.
\end{equation*}
(When $\sigmae_y$ acts on the combined state it flips over the
electron, but does nothing to the proton and multiplies the result
by $-i$.) Operating on the other states, $\sigmae_y$ would give
\begin{align*}
\sigmae_y\,\ket{+\,+}&=i\,\ket{-\,+},\\[1ex]
\sigmae_y\,\ket{+\,-}&=i\,\ket{-\,-},\\[1ex]
\sigmae_y\,\ket{-\,-}&=-i\,\ket{+\,-}.
\end{align*}
Just remember that the operators $\FLPsigmae$ work only on the
<em class="emph">first</em> spin symbol—that is, on the <em class="emph">electron</em> spin.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Next we define the corresponding operator “sigma proton” for the proton spin. Its three components $\sigmap_x$,
$\sigmap_y$, $\sigmap_z$ act in the same way as $\FLPsigmae$, only on
the <em class="emph">proton</em> spin. For example, if we have $\sigmap_x$ acting on
each of the four base states, we get—always using
Table <a href="#Ch12-T1">12-1</a>—
\begin{align*}
\sigmap_x\,\ket{+\,+}&=\ket{+\,-},\\[1ex]
\sigmap_x\,\ket{+\,-}&=\ket{+\,+},\\[1ex]
\sigmap_x\,\ket{-\,+}&=\ket{-\,-},\\[1ex]
\sigmap_x\,\ket{-\,-}&=\ket{-\,+}.
\end{align*}
As you can see, it’s not very hard.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now in the most general case we could have more complex things. For
instance, we could have products of the two operators
like $\sigmae_y\sigmap_z$. When we have such a product we do first what the
operator on the right says, and then do what the other one
says.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> For
example, we would have that
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation*}
\sigmae_x\sigmap_z\,\ket{+\,-}=
\sigmae_x(\sigmap_z\,\ket{+\,-})=
\sigmae_x(-\,\ket{+\,-})=
-\sigmae_x\,\ket{+\,-}=
-\ket{-\,-}.

\sigmae_x(-\,\ket{+\,-})=
-\sigmae_x\,\ket{+\,-}=
-\ket{-\,-}.
\end{gather*}
</span>
Note that these operators don’t do anything on pure numbers—we have
used this fact when we wrote $\sigmae_x(-1)=(-1)\sigmae_x$. We say
that the operators “commute” with pure numbers, or that a number
“can be moved through” the operator. You can practice by showing
that the product $\sigmae_x\sigmap_z$ gives the following results for
the four states:
\begin{align*}
\sigmae_x\sigmap_z\,\ket{+\,+}&=+\,\ket{-\,+},\\[1ex]
\sigmae_x\sigmap_z\,\ket{+\,-}&=-\,\ket{-\,-},\\[1ex]
\sigmae_x\sigmap_z\,\ket{-\,+}&=+\,\ket{+\,+},\\[1ex]

<div id="Ch12-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">If we take all the possible operators, using each kind of operator
only once, there are sixteen possibilities. Yes,
<em class="emph">sixteen</em>—provided we include also the “unit
operator” $\hat{1}$. First, there are the three: $\sigmae_x$, $\sigmae_y$,
$\sigmae_z$. Then the three $\sigmap_x$, $\sigmap_y$,
$\sigmap_z$—that makes six. In addition, there are the nine possible
products of the form $\sigmae_x\sigmap_y$ which makes a total
of 15. And there’s the unit operator which just leaves any state
unchanged. Sixteen in all.

<div id="Ch12-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Now note that for a four-state system, the Hamiltonian matrix has to
be a four-by-four matrix of coefficients—it will have sixteen
entries. It is easily demonstrated that any four-by-four matrix—and,
therefore, the Hamiltonian matrix in particular—can be written as a
linear combination of the sixteen double-spin matrices corresponding to
the set of operators we have just made up. Therefore, for the
interaction between a proton and an electron that involves only their
spins, we can expect that the Hamiltonian operator can be written as a
linear combination of the same $16$ operators. The only question is,
how?
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Well, first, we know that the interaction doesn’t depend on our choice
of axes for a coordinate system. If there is no external
disturbance—like a magnetic field—to determine a unique direction
in space, the Hamiltonian can’t depend on our choice of the direction
of the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes. That means that the Hamiltonian can’t
have a term like $\sigmae_x$ all by itself. It would be ridiculous,
because then somebody with a different coordinate system would get
different results.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S2-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">The only possibilities are a term with the unit matrix, say a
constant $a$ (times $\hat{1}$), and some combination of the sigmas that doesn’t
depend on the coordinates—some “invariant” combination. The only
<em class="emph">scalar</em> invariant combination of two vectors is the dot product,
which for our $\sigma$’s is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:4}
\FLPsigmae\cdot\FLPsigmap=
\sigmae_x\sigmap_x+
\sigmae_y\sigmap_y+
\sigmae_z\sigmap_z.
\end{equation}
This operator is invariant with respect to any rotation of the
coordinate system. So the only possibility for a Hamiltonian with the
proper symmetry in space is a constant times the unit matrix plus a
constant times this dot product, say,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:5}
\Hop=E_0+A\,\FLPsigmae\cdot\FLPsigmap.
\end{equation}
That’s our Hamiltonian. It’s the only thing that it can be, by the
symmetry of space, <em class="emph">so long as there is no external field</em>. The
constant term doesn’t tell us much; it just depends on the level we
choose to measure energies from. We may just as well take $E_0=0$. The
second term tells us all we need to know to find the level splitting
of the hydrogen.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S2-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">If you want to, you can think of the Hamiltonian in a different
way. If there are two magnets near each other with magnetic moments
$\FLPmu_{\text{e}}$ and $\FLPmu_{\text{p}}$, the mutual energy will
depend on $\FLPmu_{\text{e}}\cdot\FLPmu_{\text{p}}$—among other
things. And, you remember, we found that the classical thing we
call $\FLPmu_{\text{e}}$ appears in quantum mechanics
as $\mu_{\text{e}}\FLPsigmae$. Similarly, what appears classically
as $\FLPmu_{\text{p}}$ will usually turn out in quantum mechanics to
be $\mu_{\text{p}}\FLPsigmap$ (where $\mu_{\text{p}}$ is the magnetic
moment of the proton, which is about $1000$ times smaller
than $\mu_{\text{e}}$, and has the opposite sign). So Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII125">12.5</a>)
says that the interaction energy is like the interaction between two
magnets—only not quite, because the interaction of the two magnets
depends on the radial distance between them. But Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII125">12.5</a>)
could be—and, in fact, <em class="emph">is</em>—some kind of an average
interaction. The electron is moving all around inside the atom, and our
Hamiltonian gives only the average interaction energy. All it says is
that for a prescribed arrangement in space for the electron and proton
there is an energy proportional to the cosine of the angle between the
two magnetic moments, speaking classically. Such a classical qualitative
picture may help you to understand where it comes from, but the
important thing is that Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII125">12.5</a>) is the correct quantum
mechanical formula.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S2-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">The order of magnitude of the classical interaction between two
magnets would be the product of the two magnetic moments divided by
the cube of the distance between them. The distance between the
electron and the proton in the hydrogen atom is, speaking roughly, one
half an atomic radius, or $0.5$ angstrom. It is, therefore, possible
to make a crude estimate that the constant $A$ should be about equal
to the product of the two magnetic moments $\mu_{\text{e}}$
and $\mu_{\text{p}}$ divided by the cube of $1/2$ angstrom. Such an
estimate gives a number in the right ball park. It turns out that $A$
can be calculated accurately once you understand the complete quantum
theory of the hydrogen atom—which we so far do not. It has, in fact,
been calculated to an accuracy of about $30$ parts in one million. So,
unlike the flip-flop constant $A$ of the ammonia molecule, which
couldn’t be calculated at all well by a theory, our constant $A$ for
the hydrogen <em class="emph">can</em> be calculated from a more detailed theory. But
never mind, we will for our present purposes think of the $A$ as a
number which could be determined by experiment, and analyze the
physics of the situation.

<p class="p">Taking the Hamiltonian of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII125">12.5</a>), we can use it

to find out what the spin interactions do to the energy levels. To do
that, we need to work out the sixteen matrix
elements $H_{ij}=\bracket{i}{H}{j}$ corresponding to each pair of the four base
states in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII121">12.1</a>).

</span>
Using the method we described a little earlier—it’s easy if you have
memorized Table <a href="#Ch12-T1">12-1</a>—we find what each pair
of $\sigma$’s does on $\ket{+\,+}$. The answer is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\sigmae_x\sigmap_x\,\ket{+\,+}&=+\,\ket{-\,-},\\[1ex]
\sigmae_y\sigmap_y\,\ket{+\,+}&=-\,\ket{-\,-},\\[1ex]

Since our four base states are all orthogonal, that gives us
immediately that
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\bracket{+\,+}{H}{+\,+}&=A\braket{+\,+}{+\,+}=A,\\[1ex]
\bracket{+\,-}{H}{+\,+}&=A\braket{+\,-}{+\,+}=0,\\[1ex]

\bracket{-\,-}{H}{+\,+}&=A\braket{-\,-}{+\,+}=0.
\end{aligned}
\label{Eq:III:12:10}
\end{equation}
Remembering that $\bracket{j}{H}{i}=\bracket{i}{H}{j}\cconj$, we can
already write down the differential equation for the amplitudes $C_1$:
\begin{equation*}
i\hbar\dot{C}_1=H_{11}C_1+H_{12}C_2+H_{13}C_3+H_{14}C_4
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation}

through the same procedure for $\Hop$ operating on the other

<p class="p">Before solving these equations we can’t resist telling you about a
clever rule due to Dirac—it will make you feel that you are really

\begin{equation}

\FLPsigmae\cdot\FLPsigmap\,\ket{-\,-}&=2\,\ket{-\,-}-\ket{-\,-};

then they are all quite similar. Now I invent a new operator, which I
will call $P_{\text{spin exch}}$ and which I <em class="emph">define</em> to have the
following properties:<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a>

P_{\text{spin exch}}\,\ket{-\,-}&=\ket{-\,-}.
\end{align*}
All the operator does is interchange the spin directions of the two
particles. Then I can write the whole set of equations
in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1215">12.15</a>) as a simple operator equation:

<span class="tag">12–3</span>The energy levels</h3>

<div id="Ch12-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we are ready to work out the energy levels of the ground state of
hydrogen by solving the Hamiltonian equations (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1214">12.14</a>). We
want to find the energies of the stationary states. This means that we
want to find those special states $\ket{\psi}$ for which each
amplitude $C_i=\braket{i}{\psi}$ in the set belonging to $\ket{\psi}$
has the same time dependence—namely, $e^{-i\omega t}$. Then the
state will have the energy $E=\hbar\omega$. So we want a set for which
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:17}
C_i=a_ie^{-(i/\hbar)Et},
\end{equation}
where the four coefficients $a_i$ are independent of time. To see
whether we can get such amplitudes, we substitute (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1217">12.17</a>)
into Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1214">12.14</a>) and see what happens. Each
$i\hbar\,dC/dt$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1214">12.14</a>) turns into $EC$,
and—after cancelling out the common exponential factor—each $C$
becomes an $a$; we get

\begin{aligned}
Ea_1&=Aa_1,\\[1ex]
Ea_2&=-Aa_2+2Aa_3,\\[1ex]
Ea_3&=2Aa_2-Aa_3,\\[1ex]
Ea_4&=Aa_4,
\end{aligned}
\label{Eq:III:12:18}
\end{equation}
which we have to solve for $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, and $a_4$. Isn’t it nice that
the first equation is independent of the rest—that means we can see one
solution right away. If we choose $E=A$,
\begin{equation*}
a_1=1,\quad a_2=a_3=a_4=0,
\end{equation*}
gives a solution. (Of course, taking all the $a$’s equal to zero also gives a
solution, but that’s no state at all!) Let’s call our first solution the
state $\ket{\slI}$:<a name="footnote_source_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup class="mark">3</sup></a>
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:19}
\ket{\slI}=\ket{\slOne}=\ket{+\,+}.

E_{\slI}=A.

Adding the two, we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:21}
E(a_2+a_3)=A(a_2+a_3).
\end{equation}
Subtracting, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:22}
E(a_2-a_3)=-3A(a_2-a_3).

The error is only two parts in $100$ billion! Probably no basic
physical quantity is measured better than that—it’s one of the most
remarkably accurate measurements in physics. The theorists were very
happy that they could compute the energy to an accuracy of $3$ parts
in $10^5$, but in the meantime it has been measured to $2$ parts
in $10^{11}$—a million times more accurate than the theory. So the
experimenters are way ahead of the theorists. In the theory of the
ground state of the hydrogen atom <em class="emph">you</em> are as good as
anybody. You, too, can just take your value of $A$ from

to $21$-cm waves (or $1420$ megacycles approximately) we can observe the
velocities and the location of concentrations of atomic hydrogen gas. By
measuring the intensity, we can estimate the amount of hydrogen. By
measuring the frequency shift due to the Doppler

<div id="Ch12-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Although we have finished the problem of finding the energy levels of
the hydrogen ground state, we would like to study this interesting
system some more. In order to say anything more about it—for
instance, in order to calculate the rate at which the hydrogen atom
absorbs or emits radio waves at $21$ centimeters—we have to know
what happens when the atom is disturbed. We have to do as we did for
the ammonia molecule—after we found the energy levels we went on and
studied what happened when the molecule was in an electric field. We
were then able to figure out the effects from the electric field in a
radio wave. For the hydrogen atom, the electric field does nothing to
the levels, except to move them all by some constant amount
proportional to the square of the field—which is not of any interest
because that won’t change the energy <em class="emph">differences</em>. It is now the
<em class="emph">magnetic</em> field which is important. So the next step is to write
the Hamiltonian for a more complicated situation in which the atom
sits in an external magnetic field.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">What, then, is the Hamiltonian? We’ll just tell you the answer,
because we can’t give you any “proof” except to say that this is the
way the atom works.

<div id="Ch12-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The Hamiltonian is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:27}
\Hop=A(\FLPsigmae\cdot\FLPsigmap)-
\mu_{\text{e}}\FLPsigmae\cdot\FLPB-
\mu_{\text{p}}\FLPsigmap\cdot\FLPB.
\end{equation}
It now consists of three parts. The first
term $A\FLPsigmae\cdot\FLPsigmap$ represents the magnetic interaction
between the electron and the proton—it is the same one that would be
there if there were no magnetic field. This is the term we have
already had; and the influence of the magnetic field on the
constant $A$ is negligible. The effect of the external magnetic field shows up
in the last two terms. The second term,
$-\mu_{\text{e}}\FLPsigmae\cdot\FLPB$, is the energy the electron
would have in the magnetic field if it were there
alone.<a name="footnote_source_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup class="mark">5</sup></a>
In the same way, the last
term $-\mu_{\text{p}}\FLPsigmap\cdot\FLPB$, would have been the energy of a
proton alone. Classically, the energy of the two of them together
would be the sum of the two, and that works also quantum
mechanically. In a magnetic field, the energy of interaction due to
the magnetic field is just the sum of the energy of interaction of the
electron with the external field, and of the proton with the
field—both expressed in terms of the sigma operators. In quantum
mechanics these terms are not really the energies, but thinking of the
classical formulas for the energy is a way of remembering the rules
for writing down the Hamiltonian. Anyway, the correct Hamiltonian is
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1227">12.27</a>).
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we have to go back to the beginning and do the problem all over
again. Much of the work is, however, done—we need only to add the
effects of the new terms. Let’s take a constant magnetic field $\FLPB$
in the $z$-direction. Then we have to add to our Hamiltonian
operator $\Hop$ the two new pieces—which we can call $\Hop'$:
\begin{equation*}
\Hop'=-(\mu_{\text{e}}\sigmae_z+\mu_{\text{p}}\sigmap_z)B.
\end{equation*}
Using Table <a href="#Ch12-T1">12-1</a>, we get right away that

The energy $E_{\slI}$ starts at $A$ and increases linearly
with $B$—with the slope $\mu$. The energy $E_{\slII}$ also starts at $A$
but <em class="emph">decreases</em> linearly with increasing $B$—its slope
is $-\mu$. These two levels vary with $B$ as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch12-F3">12-3</a>. We show also in the figure the energies
$E_{\slIII}$ and $E_{\slIV}$. They have a different $B$-dependence. For
small $B$, they depend quadratically on $B$, so they start out with
horizontal slopes. Then they begin to curve, and for <em class="emph">large</em> $B$
they approach straight lines with slopes $\pm\mu'$, which are nearly the
same as the slopes of $E_{\slI}$ and $E_{\slII}$.

absorption or emission of a photon whose frequency $1420$ megacycles is
$1/h$ times the energy difference $4A$. When the atom is in a magnetic

transitions between any two of the four states. So if we have atoms in
all four states, energy can be absorbed—or emitted—in any one of the
six transitions shown by the vertical arrows in Fig. <a href="#Ch12-F4">12-4</a>.

<p class="p">What makes the transitions go? The transitions will occur if you apply
a small disturbing magnetic field that varies with time (in addition
to the steady strong field $\FLPB$). It’s just as we saw for a varying
electric field on the ammonia molecule. Only here, it is the magnetic
field which couples with the magnetic moments and does the trick. But
the theory follows through in the same way that we worked it out for
the ammonia. The theory is the simplest if you take a perturbing
magnetic field that rotates in the $xy$-plane—although any
horizontal oscillating field will do. When you put in this perturbing
field as an additional term in the Hamiltonian, you get solutions in
which the amplitudes vary with time—as we found for the ammonia
molecule. So you can calculate easily and accurately the probability
of a transition from one state to another. And you find that it all
agrees with experiment.

<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">12–5</span>The states in a magnetic field</h3>

<div id="Ch12-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We would like now to discuss the shapes of the curves in
Fig. <a href="#Ch12-F3">12-3</a>. In the first place, the energies for large
fields are easy to understand, and rather interesting. For $B$ large
enough (namely for $\mu B/A\gg1$) we can neglect the $1$ in the formulas
of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1237">12.37</a>). The four energies become
\begin{equation}
\begin{alignedat}{2}
E_{\slI}\;&=A+\mu B,&\quad
E_{\slII}\;&=A-\mu B,\\[1ex]
E_{\slIII}\;&=-A+\mu'B,&\quad
E_{\slIV}\;&=-A-\mu'B.
\end{alignedat}
\label{Eq:III:12:38}
\end{equation}
These are the equations of the four straight lines in
Fig. <a href="#Ch12-F3">12-3</a>. We can understand these energies physically in
the following way. The nature of the stationary states in a <em class="emph">zero</em>
field is determined completely by the interaction of the two magnetic
moments.  The mixtures of the base states $\ket{+\,-}$ and $\ket{-\,+}$
in the stationary states $\ket{\slIII}$ and $\ket{\slIV}$ are due to
this interaction. In <em class="emph">large external</em> fields, however, the proton
and electron will be influenced hardly at all by the field of the other;
each will act as if it were alone in the external field. Then—as we
have seen many times—the electron spin will be either parallel to or
opposite to the external magnetic field.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose the electron spin is “up”—that is, along the field; its
energy will be $-\mu_{\text{e}}B$. The proton can still be either
way. If the proton spin is also “up,” its energy
is $-\mu_{\text{p}}B$. The sum of the two
is $-(\mu_{\text{e}}+\mu_{\text{p}})B=\mu B$. That is just what we find
for $E_{\slI}$—which is fine, because we are describing the
state $\ket{+\,+}=\ket{\slI}$. There is still the small additional term $A$
(now $\mu B\gg A$) which represents the interaction energy of the
proton and electron when their spins are parallel. (We originally
took $A$ as positive because the theory we spoke of says it should be, and
experimentally it is indeed so.) On the other hand, the proton can
have its spin down. Then its energy in the external field goes
to $+\mu_{\text{p}}B$, so it and the electron have the
energy $-(\mu_{\text{e}}-\mu_{\text{p}})B=\mu'B$. And the interaction energy
becomes $-A$. The sum is just the energy $E_{\slIII}$,
in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1238">12.38</a>). So the state $\ket{\slIII}$ must for large
fields become the state $\ket{+\,-}$.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose now the electron spin is “down.” Its energy in the external
field is $\mu_{\text{e}}B$. If the proton is also “down,” the two
together have the energy $(\mu_{\text{e}}+\mu_{\text{p}})B=-\mu B$,
<em class="emph">plus</em> the interaction energy $A$—since their spins are
parallel. That makes just the energy $E_{\slII}$ in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1238">12.38</a>)
and corresponds to the state $\ket{-\,-}=\ket{\slII}$—which is nice.
Finally if the electron is “down” and the proton is “up,” we get the
energy $(\mu_{\text{e}}-\mu_{\text{p}})B-A$ (<em class="emph">minus</em> $A$ for the
interaction because the spins are opposite) which is just $E_{\slIV}$.
And the state corresponds to $\ket{-\,+}$.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">“But, wait a moment!”, you are probably saying, “The states
$\ket{\slIII}$ and $\ket{\slIV}$ <em class="emph">are not</em> the states
$\ket{+\,-}$ and $\ket{-\,+}$; they are <em class="emph">mixtures</em> of the two.”
Well, only slightly. They are indeed mixtures for $B=0$, but we have
not yet figured out what they are for large $B$. When we used the
analogies of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1233">12.33</a>) in our formulas of
Chapter <a href="III_09.html">9</a> to get the energies of the stationary states,
we could also have taken the amplitudes that go with them. They come
from Eq. (<a href="III_09.html#mjx-eqn-EqIII924">9.24</a>), which is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a_2}{a_3}=\frac{E-H_{22}}{H_{21}}.
\end{equation*}
The ratio $a_2/a_3$ is, of course, just $C_2/C_3$. Plugging in the
analogous quantities from (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1233">12.33</a>), we get
\begin{align}
\frac{C_2}{C_3}&=
\frac{E+A-(\mu_{\text{e}}-\mu_{\text{p}})B}{2A}\notag\\
\kern{-6em}\text{or}\notag\\ % ebook remove
% ebook insert: \makebox[0em]{\kern{-10em}\text{or}}\notag\\
\label{Eq:III:12:39}
\frac{C_2}{C_3}&=\frac{E+A+\mu'B}{2A},
\end{align}}
where for $E$ we are to use the appropriate energy—either
$E_{\slIII}$ or $E_{\slIV}$. For instance, for state $\ket{\slIII}$
we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:40}
\biggl(\frac{C_2}{C_3}\biggr)_{\slIII}\approx\frac{\mu'B}{A}.
\end{equation}
So for large $B$ the state $\ket{\slIII}$ has $C_2\gg C_3$; the state
becomes almost completely the state $\ket{\slTwo}=\ket{+\,-}$. Similarly,
if we put $E_{\slIV}$ into (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1239">12.39</a>) we get $(C_2/C_3)_{\slIV}\ll1$;
for high fields state $\ket{\slIV}$ becomes just the
state $\ket{\slThree}=\ket{-\,+}$. You see that the coefficients in the linear
combinations of our base states which make up the stationary states
depend on $B$. The state we call $\ket{\slIII}$ is a $50$-$50$ mixture
of $\ket{+\,-}$ and $\ket{-\,+}$ at very low fields, but shifts
completely over to $\ket{+\,-}$ at high fields. Similarly, the
state $\ket{\slIV}$, which at low fields is also a $50$-$50$ mixture (with
opposite signs) of $\ket{+\,-}$ and $\ket{-\,+}$, goes over into the
state $\ket{-\,+}$ when the spins are uncoupled by a strong external
field.

<p class="p">We would also like to call your attention particularly to what happens
at <em class="emph">very low</em> magnetic fields. There is one energy—at $-3A$—which
<em class="emph">does not change</em> when you turn on a small magnetic
field. And there is another energy—at $+A$—which splits into three different energy levels 
when you turn on a small magnetic field. For weak fields the energies vary with $B$ as shown 
in Fig. <a href="#Ch12-F5">12–5</a>. Suppose that we have somehow selected a bunch 
of hydrogen atoms which all have the energy $-3A$. If we put them through a Stern-Gerlach 
experiment—with fields that are not too strong—we would find that they just go straight through. 
(Since their energy doesn’t depend on $B$, there is—according to the principle of virtual 
work—no force on them in a magnetic field gradient.) Suppose, on the other hand, we were to 
select a bunch of atoms with the energy $+A$, and put them through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus, 
say an $S$ apparatus. (Again the fields in the apparatus should not be so great that they disrupt 
the insides of the atom, by which we mean a field small enough that the energies vary linearly 
with $B$.) We would find <em class="emph">three beams</em>. The states $\ket{\slI}$ and 
$\ket{\slII}$ get opposite forces—their energies vary linearly with $B$ with the slopes $\pm\mu$ 
so the <em class="emph">forces</em> are like those on a dipole with $\mu_z=\mp\mu$; but the state 
$\ket{\slIII}$ goes straight through. So we are right back in Chapter <a href="III_05.html">5</a>. 
<em class="emph">A hydrogen atom with the energy $+A$ is a spin-one particle</em>. 
This energy state is a “particle” for which $j=1$, and it can be described—with respect to
some set of axes in space—in terms of the base states $\ket{+S}$, $\ket{\OS}$,
and $\ket{-S}$ we used in Chapter <a href="III_05.html">5</a>. On the
other hand, when a hydrogen atom has the energy $-3A$, it is a spin-zero
particle. (Remember, what we are saying is only strictly true for
infinitesimal magnetic fields.)  So we can group the states of hydrogen
in zero magnetic field this way:

<p class="p">We have said in Chapter <a href="II_35.html">35</a> of Volume II that
for any particle its component of angular momentum along any axis can
have only certain values always $\hbar$ apart. The $z$-component of
angular momentum $J_z$ can be $j\hbar$, $(j-1)\hbar$, $(j-2)\hbar$, $\ldots$, $(-j)\hbar$,
where $j$ is the spin of the particle (which can be
an integer or half-integer). Although we neglected to say so at the
time, people usually write
\begin{equation}

J_z=m\hbar,

<div id="Ch12-S6-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We would like now to use our knowledge of the hydrogen atom to do
something special. We discussed in Chapter <a href="III_05.html">5</a> that a
particle of <em class="emph">spin one</em> which was in one of the base states ($+$, $0$,
or $-$) with respect to a Stern-Gerlach apparatus of a particular
orientation—say an $S$ apparatus—would have a certain amplitude to
be in each of the three states with respect to a $T$ apparatus with a
different orientation in space. There are nine such
amplitudes $\braket{jT}{iS}$ which make up the projection matrix. In
Section <a href="III_05.html#Ch5-S7">5–77</a> we gave without proof the terms of this
matrix for various orientations of $T$ with respect to $S$. Now we will
show you one way they can be derived.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">In the hydrogen atom we have found a spin-one system which is made up
of two spin one-half particles. We have already worked out in
Chapter <a href="III_06.html">6</a> how to transform the spin one-half amplitudes.
We can use this information to calculate the transformation for spin
one. This is the way it works: We have a system—a hydrogen atom with
the energy $+A$—which has spin one. Suppose we run it through a
Stern-Gerlach filter $S$, so that we know it is in one of the base
states with respect to $S$, say $\ket{+S}$. What is the amplitude that
it will be in one of the base states, say $\ket{+T}$, with respect to
the $T$ apparatus? If we call the coordinate system of the $S$ apparatus
the $x,y,z$ system, the $\ket{+S}$ state is what we have been calling
the state $\ket{+\,+}$. But suppose another guy took his $z$-axis along
the axis of $T$. He will be referring his states to what we will call
the $x',y',z'$ frame. His “up” and “down” states for the electron
and proton would be different from ours. <em class="emph">His</em> “plus-plus”
state—which we can write $\ket{+'\,+'}$, referring to the “prime”
frame—is the $\ket{+T}$ state of the spin-one particle. What we want
is $\braket{+T}{+S}$ which is just another way of writing the
amplitude $\braket{+'\,+'}{+\,+}$.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch12-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We can find the amplitude $\braket{+'\,+'}{+\,+}$ in the following
way. In <em class="emph">our</em> frame the <em class="emph">electron</em> in the $\ket{+\,+}$ state
has its spin “up”. That means that it has some
amplitude $\braket{+'}{+}_{\text{e}}$ of being “up” in <em class="emph">his</em> frame, and
some amplitude $\braket{-'}{+}_{\text{e}}$ of being “down” in that
frame. Similarly, the <em class="emph">proton</em> in the $\ket{+\,+}$ state has spin
“up” in our frame and the amplitudes $\braket{+'}{+}_{\text{p}}$
and $\braket{-'}{+}_{\text{p}}$ of having spin “up” or spin “down” in
the “prime” frame. Since we are talking about two distinct
particles, the amplitude that <em class="emph">both</em> particles will be “up”
<em class="emph">together</em> in <em class="emph">his</em> frame is the product of the two
amplitudes,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:44}
\braket{+'\,+'}{+\,+}=
\braket{+'}{+}_{\text{e}}\braket{+'}{+}_{\text{p}}.
\end{equation}
We have put the subscripts e and p on the amplitudes $\braket{+'}{+}$
to make it clear what we were doing. But they are both just the
transformation amplitudes for a spin one-half particle, so they are
really identical numbers. They are, in fact, just the amplitude we
have called $\braket{+T}{+S}$ in Chapter <a href="III_06.html">6</a>, and which
we listed in the tables at the end of that chapter.

called $\braket{+T}{+S}$ for a <em class="emph">spin-one</em> particle—yet they are
completely different!  We hope it won’t be too confusing, but
<em class="emph">for the moment</em> at least, we will have to use some different
symbols for the spin one-half amplitudes. To help you keep things
straight, we summarize the new notation in Table <a href="#Ch12-T4">12-4</a>. We
will continue to use the notation $\ket{+S}$, $\ket{\OS}$,

and this is just the spin-<em class="emph">one</em> amplitude $\braket{+T}{+S}$. Now,
let’s suppose, for instance, that the other guy’s coordinate

\begin{equation*}

\label{Eq:III:12:46}

We can, then, write the state $\ket{+\,+}$ as the following linear

<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:48}
\ket{+S}=a^2\,\ket{+T}+\sqrt{2}\,ab\,\ket{\OT}+b^2\,\ket{-T}.
\end{equation}
In a similar way you can easily show that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:49}
\ket{-S}=c^2\,\ket{+T}+\sqrt{2}\,cd\,\ket{\OT}+d^2\,\ket{-T}.
\end{equation}
For $\ket{\OS}$ it’s a little more complicated, because
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\OS}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,\{\ket{+\,-}+\ket{-\,+}\}.
\end{equation*}
But we can express each of the states $\ket{+\,-}$ and $\ket{-\,+}$ in
terms of the “prime” states and take the sum. That is,
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:50}
\ket{+\,-}=
ac\,\ket{+'\,+'}+ad\,\ket{+'\,-'}+
bc\,\ket{-'\,+'}+bd\,\ket{-'\,-'}
\end{equation}
</span>
<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{+\,-}&&=ac\,&\ket{+'\,+'}+ad\,\ket{+'\,-'}\notag\\[.5ex]
\label{Eq:III:12:50}
&&+\,bc\,&\ket{-'\,+'}+bd\,\ket{-'\,-'}
\end{alignat}
</span>
and
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:51}
\ket{-\,+}=
ac\,\ket{+'\,+'}+bc\,\ket{+'\,-'}+
ad\,\ket{-'\,+'}+bd\,\ket{-'\,-'}.
\end{equation}
</span>
<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{alignat}{2}
\ket{-\,+}&&=ac\,&\ket{+'\,+'}+bc\,\ket{+'\,-'}\notag\\[.5ex]
\label{Eq:III:12:51}
&&+\,ad\,&\ket{-'\,+'}+bd\,\ket{-'\,-'}.
\end{alignat}
</span>
Taking $1/\sqrt{2}$ times the sum, we get
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\OS}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\,ac\,\ket{+'\,+'}+
\frac{ad+bc}{\sqrt{2}}\,\{\ket{+'\,-'}+\ket{-'\,+'}\}+
\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\,bd\,\ket{-'\,-'}.
\end{equation*}
</span>
<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{alignat*}{3}
\ket{\OS}&=&&\phantom{a}\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\,ac&\,&\ket{+'\,+'}\\[.75ex]
&+&&\frac{ad+bc}{\sqrt{2}}&\{\,&\ket{+'\,-'}+\ket{-'\,+'}\,\}\\[.75ex]
&+&&\phantom{a}\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}\,bd&\,&\ket{-'\,-'}.
\end{alignat*}
</span>
It follows that
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:12:52}
\ket{\OS}=\sqrt{2}\,ac\,\ket{+T}+(ad+bc)\,\ket{\OT}+
\sqrt{2}\,bd\,\ket{-T}.
\end{equation}
</span>
<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{align}
\ket{\OS}&=\sqrt{2}ac\,\ket{+T}\notag\\[.5ex]
&+(ad+bc)\,\ket{\OT}\notag\\[.5ex]
\label{Eq:III:12:52}
&+\sqrt{2}\,bd\,\ket{-T}.
\end{align}

angle $\alpha$ about the $y$-axis—as in Fig. <a href="III_05.html#Ch5-F6">5-6</a>—the

of $R_y(\alpha)$ in Table <a href="III_06.html#Ch6-T2">6-2</a>.

<p class="p">What ever happened to the state $\ket{\slIV}$?! Well, it is a
spin-zero system, so it has only one state—it is the <em class="emph">same in
all coordinate systems</em>. We can check that everything works out by
taking the difference of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1250">12.50</a>)
and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1251">12.51</a>); we get that
\begin{equation*}
\ket{+\,-}-\ket{-\,+}=(ad-bc)\{\ket{+'\,-'}-\ket{-'\,+'}\}.
\end{equation*}
But $(ad-bc)$ is the determinant of the spin one-half matrix, and so
is equal to $1$. We get that
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\slIV'}=\ket{\slIV}
\end{equation*}
for any relative orientation of the two coordinate frames.

Remember that classically $U=-\FLPmu\cdot\FLPB$, so
the energy is lowest when the moment is along the field. For positive
particles, the magnetic moment is parallel to the spin and for
negative particles it is opposite. So in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1227">12.27</a>),
$\mu_{\text{p}}$ is a <em class="emph">positive</em> number, but $\mu_{\text{e}}$ is
a <em class="emph">negative</em> number.
