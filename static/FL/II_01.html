<div id="Ch1-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Consider a force like gravitation which varies predominantly
inversely as the square of the distance, but which is about a
<em class="emph">billion-billion-billion-billion</em> times stronger. And with another
difference. There are two kinds of “matter,” which we can call
positive and negative. Like kinds repel and unlike kinds
attract—unlike gravity where there is only attraction. What would
happen?</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">A bunch of positives would repel with an enormous force and spread out
in all directions. A bunch of negatives would do the same. But an
evenly mixed bunch of positives and negatives would do something
completely different. The opposite pieces would be pulled together by
the enormous attractions. The net result would be that the terrific
forces would balance themselves out almost perfectly, by forming
tight, fine mixtures of the positive and the negative, and between two
separate bunches of such mixtures there would be practically no
attraction or repulsion at all.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">There is such a force: the electrical force. And all matter is a mixture
of positive protons and negative electrons which are attracting and
repelling with this great force. So perfect is the balance, however,
that when you stand near someone else you don’t feel any force at all.
If there were even a little bit of unbalance you would know it. If you
were standing at arm’s length from someone and each of you had <em class="emph">one
percent</em> more electrons than protons, the repelling force would be
incredible. How great? Enough to lift the Empire State Building? No! To
lift Mount Everest? No! The repulsion would be enough to lift a
“weight” equal to that of the entire earth!</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">With such enormous forces so perfectly balanced in this intimate
mixture, it is not hard to understand that matter, trying to keep its
positive and negative charges in the finest balance, can have a great
stiffness and strength. The Empire State Building, for example, swings
less than one inch in the wind because the electrical forces hold every
electron and proton more or less in its proper place. On the other
hand, if we look at matter on a scale small enough that we see only a
few atoms, any small piece will not, usually, have an equal number of
positive and negative charges, and so there will be strong residual
electrical forces. Even when there are equal numbers of both charges
in two neighboring small pieces, there may still be large net
electrical forces because the forces between individual charges vary
inversely as the square of the distance. A net force can arise if a
negative charge of one piece is closer to the positive than to the
negative charges of the other piece. The attractive forces can then be
larger than the repulsive ones and there can be a net attraction
between two small pieces with no excess charges. The force that holds
the atoms together, and the chemical forces that hold molecules
together, are really electrical forces acting in regions where the
balance of charge is not perfect, or where the distances are very
small.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">You know, of course, that atoms are made with positive protons in the
nucleus and with electrons outside. You may ask: “If this electrical
force is so terrific, why don’t the protons and electrons just get on
top of each other? If they want to be in an intimate mixture, why
isn’t it still more intimate?” The answer has to do with the quantum
effects. If we try to confine our electrons in a region that is very
close to the protons, then according to the uncertainty
principle they
must have some mean square momentum which is larger the more we try to
confine them. It is this motion, required by the laws of quantum
mechanics, that keeps the electrical attraction from bringing the
charges any closer together.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">There is another question: “What holds the nucleus together”? In a
nucleus there are several protons, all of which are positive. Why don’t
they push themselves apart? It turns out that in nuclei there are, in
addition to electrical forces, nonelectrical forces, called nuclear
forces, which are greater than the electrical forces and which are able
to hold the protons together in spite of the electrical repulsion. The
nuclear forces, however, have a short range—their force falls off much
more rapidly than $1/r^2$. And this has an important consequence. If a
nucleus has too many protons in it, it gets too big, and it will not
stay together. An example is uranium, with 92 protons. The nuclear
forces act mainly between each proton (or neutron) and its nearest
neighbor, while the electrical forces act over larger distances, giving
a repulsion between each proton and all of the others in the nucleus.
The more protons in a nucleus, the stronger is the electrical repulsion,
until, as in the case of uranium, the balance is so delicate that the
nucleus is almost ready to fly apart from the repulsive electrical
force. If such a nucleus is just “tapped” lightly (as can be done by
sending in a slow neutron), it breaks into two pieces, each with
positive charge, and these pieces fly apart by electrical repulsion. The
energy which is liberated is the energy of the atomic bomb. This energy
is usually called “nuclear” energy, but it is really “electrical”
energy released when electrical forces have overcome the attractive
nuclear forces.</p>

<div id="Ch1-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">We may ask, finally, what holds a negatively charged electron together
(since it has no nuclear forces). If an electron is all made of one
kind of substance, each part should repel the other parts. Why, then,
doesn’t it fly apart? But does the electron have “parts”? Perhaps we
should say that the electron is just a point and that electrical
forces only act between <em class="emph">different</em> point charges, so that the electron does not act
upon itself. Perhaps. All we can say is that the question of what holds
the electron together has produced many difficulties in the attempts to
form a complete theory of electromagnetism. The question has never been
answered. We will entertain ourselves by discussing this subject some
more in later chapters.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">As we have seen, we should expect that it is a combination of electrical
forces and quantum-mechanical effects that will determine the detailed
structure of materials in bulk, and, therefore, their properties. Some
materials are hard, some are soft. Some are electrical
“conductors”—because their electrons are free to
move about; others are “insulators”—because their
electrons are held tightly to individual atoms. We shall consider later
how some of these properties come about, but that is a very complicated
subject, so we will begin by looking at the electrical forces only in
simple situations. We begin by treating only the laws of
electricity—including magnetism, which is really a part of the same
subject.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">We have said that the electrical force, like a gravitational force,
decreases inversely as the square of the distance between charges. This
relationship is called Coulomb’s law. But it is not precisely true when charges are moving—the
electrical forces depend also on the motions of the charges in a
complicated way. One part of the force between moving charges we call
the <em class="emph">magnetic</em> force. It is really one aspect of an electrical effect. That is why we
call the subject “electromagnetism.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">There is an important general principle that makes it possible to
treat electromagnetic forces in a relatively simple way. We find, from
experiment, that the force that acts on a particular charge—no
matter how many other charges there are or how they are
moving—depends only on the position of that particular charge, on
the velocity of the charge, and on the amount of charge. We can write
the force $\FLPF$ on a charge $q$ moving with a velocity $\FLPv$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:1:1}
\FLPF=q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB).
\end{equation}

We call $\FLPE$ the <em class="emph">electric field</em> and $\FLPB$ the <em class="emph">magnetic
field</em> at the
location of the charge. The important thing is that the electrical
forces from all the other charges in the universe can be summarized by
giving just these two vectors. Their values will depend on <em class="emph">where</em>
the charge is, and may change with <em class="emph">time</em>. Furthermore, if we
replace that charge with another charge, the force on the new charge
will be just in proportion to the amount of charge so long as all the
rest of the charges in the world do not change their positions or
motions. (In real situations, of course, each charge produces forces on
all other charges in the neighborhood and may cause these other charges
to move, and so in some cases the fields <em class="emph">can</em> change if we replace
our particular charge by another.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">We know from Vol. I how to find the motion of a particle if we know
the force on it. Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII11">1.1</a>) can be combined with the
equation of motion to give
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:1:2}
\ddt{}{t}\biggl[\frac{m\FLPv}{(1-v^2/c^2)^{1/2}}\biggr]=
\FLPF=q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB).
\end{equation}

So if $\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$ are given, we can find the motions. Now we
need to know how the $\FLPE$’s and $\FLPB$’s are produced.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S1-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">One of the most important simplifying principles about the way the
fields are produced is this: Suppose a number of charges moving in
some manner would produce a field $\FLPE_1$, and another set of
charges would produce $\FLPE_2$. If both sets of charges are in place
at the same time (keeping the same locations and motions they had when
considered separately), then the field produced is just the sum
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:1:3}
\FLPE=\FLPE_1+\FLPE_2.
\end{equation}

This fact is called <em class="emph">the principle of
superposition</em> of fields. It
holds also for magnetic fields.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S1-p13" class="para">
<p class="p">This principle means that if we know the law for the electric and
magnetic fields produced by a <em class="emph">single</em> charge moving in an
arbitrary way, then all the laws of
electrodynamics are complete. If we want to know
the force on charge $A$ we need only calculate the $\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$
produced by each of the charges $B$, $C$, $D$, etc., and then add the
$\FLPE$’s and $\FLPB$’s from all the charges to find the fields, and
from them the forces acting on charge $A$. If it had only turned out
that the field produced by a single charge was simple, this would be the
neatest way to describe the laws of electrodynamics. We have already
given a description of this law (Chapter <a href="I_28.html">28</a>, Vol. I) and
it is, unfortunately, rather complicated.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S1-p14" class="para">
<p class="p">It turns out that the form in which the laws of electrodynamics are
simplest are not what you might expect. It is <em class="emph">not</em> simplest to
give a formula for the force that one charge produces on another. It
is true that when charges are standing still the Coulomb force
law is
simple, but when charges are moving about the relations are
complicated by delays in time and by the effects of acceleration,
among others. As a result, we do not wish to present electrodynamics
only through the force laws between charges; we find it more
convenient to consider another point of view—a point of view in
which the laws of electrodynamics appear to be the most easily
manageable.</p>

<span class="tag">1–2</span>Electric and magnetic fields</h3>
<div id="Ch1-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">First, we must extend, somewhat, our ideas of the electric and
magnetic vectors, $\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$. We have defined them in terms
of the forces that are felt by a charge. We wish now to speak of
electric and magnetic fields <em class="emph">at a point</em> even when there is no
charge present. We are saying, in effect, that since there are forces
“acting on” the charge, there is still “something” there when the
charge is removed. If a charge located at the point $(x,y,z)$ at the
time $t$ feels the force $\FLPF$ given by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII11">1.1</a>) we
associate the vectors $\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$ with <em class="emph">the point</em> in
space $(x,y,z)$. We may think of $\FLPE(x,y,z,t)$ and $\FLPB(x,y,z,t)$
as giving the forces that <em class="emph">would be</em> experienced at the time $t$
by a charge located at $(x,y,z)$, <em class="emph">with the condition</em> that
placing the charge there <em class="emph">did not disturb</em> the positions or
motions of all the other charges responsible for the fields.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Following this idea, we associate with <em class="emph">every</em> point $(x,y,z)$ in
space two vectors $\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$, which may be changing with
time. The electric and magnetic fields are, then, viewed as
<em class="emph">vector functions</em> of $x$, $y$, $z$, and $t$. Since a vector is
specified by its components, each of the fields $\FLPE(x,y,z,t)$
and $\FLPB(x,y,z,t)$ represents three mathematical functions of
$x$, $y$, $z$, and $t$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">It is precisely because $\FLPE$ (or $\FLPB$) can be specified at every
point in space that it is called a “field.” A “field” is any
physical quantity which takes on different values at different points
in space. Temperature, for example, is a field—in this case a scalar
field, which we write as $T(x,y,z)$. The temperature could also vary
in time, and we would say the temperature field is time-dependent, and
write $T(x,y,z,t)$. Another example is the “velocity field” of a
flowing liquid. We write $\FLPv(x,y,z,t)$ for the velocity of the
liquid at each point in space at the time $t$. It is a vector field.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Returning to the electromagnetic fields—although they are produced
by charges according to complicated formulas, they have the following
important characteristic: the relationships between the values of the
fields at <em class="emph">one point</em> and the values at a <em class="emph">nearby point</em> are
very simple. With only a few such relationships in the form of
differential equations we can describe the fields completely. It is in
terms of such equations that the laws of electrodynamics are most
simply written.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">There have been various inventions to help the mind visualize the
behavior of fields. The most correct is also the most abstract: we
simply consider the fields as mathematical functions of position and
time. We can also attempt to get a mental picture of the field by
drawing vectors at many points in space, each of which gives the field
strength and direction at that point. Such a representation is shown
in Fig. <a href="#Ch1-F1">1–1</a>. We can go further, however, and draw lines
which are everywhere tangent to the vectors—which, so to speak,
follow the arrows and keep track of the direction of the field. When
we do this we lose track of the <em class="emph">lengths</em> of the vectors, but we
can keep track of the strength of the field by drawing the lines far
apart when the field is weak and close together when it is strong. We
adopt the convention that the <em class="emph">number of lines per unit area</em> at
right angles to the lines is proportional to the <em class="emph">field
strength</em>. This is, of course, only an
approximation, and it will require, in general, that new lines sometimes
start up in order to keep the number up to the strength of the field.

<div id="Ch1-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">There are two mathematically important properties of a vector field
which we will use in our description of the laws of electricity from
the field point of view. Suppose we imagine a closed surface of some
kind and ask whether we are losing “something” from the inside; that
is, does the field have a quality of “outflow”?  For instance, for a
velocity field we might ask whether the velocity is always outward on
the surface or, more generally, whether more fluid flows out (per unit
time) than comes in. We call the net amount of fluid going out through
the surface per unit time the “flux of velocity” through the
surface. The flow through an element of a surface is just equal to the
component of the velocity perpendicular to the surface times the area
of the surface. For an arbitrary closed surface, the <em class="emph">net outward
flow</em>—or <em class="emph">flux</em>—is the average outward normal component of
the velocity, times the area of the surface:

<p class="p">In the case of an electric field, we can mathematically define
something analogous to an outflow, and we again call it the flux, but
of course it is not the flow of any substance, because the electric
field is not the velocity of anything. It turns out, however, that the
mathematical quantity which is the average normal component of the
field still has a useful significance. We speak, then, of the
<em class="emph">electric flux</em>—also defined by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII14">1.4</a>). Finally, it is also
useful to speak of the flux not only through a completely closed
surface, but through any bounded surface. As before, the flux through
such a surface is defined as the average normal component of a vector
times the area of the surface. These ideas are illustrated in

</div>
<div id="Ch1-S3-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">There is a second property of a vector field that has to do with a
line, rather than a surface. Suppose again that we think of a velocity
field that describes the flow of a liquid. We might ask this
interesting question: Is the liquid circulating? By that we mean: Is
there a net rotational motion around some loop? Suppose that we
instantaneously freeze the liquid everywhere except inside of a tube
which is of uniform bore, and which goes in a loop that closes back on
itself as in Fig. <a href="#Ch1-F4">1–4</a>. Outside of the tube the liquid
stops moving, but inside the tube it may keep on moving because of the
momentum in the trapped liquid—that is, if there is more momentum
heading one way around the tube than the other. We define a quantity
called the <em class="emph">circulation</em> as the resulting speed of the
liquid in
the tube times its circumference. We can again extend our ideas and
define the “circulation” for any vector field (even when there isn’t
anything moving). For any vector field the <em class="emph">circulation around
any imagined closed curve</em> is defined as the average tangential
component of the vector (in a consistent sense) multiplied by the
circumference of the loop (Fig. <a href="#Ch1-F5">1–5</a>):

usually read as “epsilon-zero” or “epsilon-naught”.) If there are
no charges inside the surface, even though there are charges nearby
outside the surface, the <em class="emph">average</em> normal component of $\FLPE$ is
zero, so there is no net flux through the surface. To show the power
of this type of statement, we can show that Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII16">1.6</a>) is
the same as Coulomb’s law,
provided only that we also add the idea
that the field from a single charge is spherically symmetric. For a
point charge, we draw a sphere around the charge. Then the average
normal component is just the value of the magnitude of $\FLPE$ at any
point, since the field must be directed radially and have the same
strength for all points on the sphere. Our rule now says that the
field at the surface of the sphere, times the area of the
sphere—that is, the outgoing flux—is proportional to the charge
inside. If we were to make the radius of the sphere bigger, the area
would increase as the square of the radius. The average normal
component of the electric field times that area must still be equal to
the same charge inside, and so the field must decrease as the square
of the distance—we get an “inverse square” field.</p>

passing a current through a wire which hangs above a bar magnet, as
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch1-F6">1–6</a>. The wire will move when a current is
turned on because of the force $\FLPF=q\FLPv\times\FLPB$. When a

fields. But wait, what is a magnet, anyway? If magnetic fields are
produced by moving charges, is it not possible that the magnetic field
from a piece of iron is really the result of currents? It appears to
be so. We can replace the bar magnet of our experiment with a coil of
wire, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch1-F9">1–9</a>. When a current is passed
through the coil—as well as through the straight wire above it—we
observe a motion of the wire exactly as before, when we had a magnet
instead of a coil. In other words, the current in the coil imitates a
magnet. It appears, then, that a piece of iron acts as though it
contains a perpetual circulating current. We can, in fact, understand
magnets in terms of permanent currents in the atoms of the iron. The

motion of the electrons in atomic orbits.
Actually, that is not the case for iron, although it is for
some materials. In addition to moving around in an atom, an electron
also spins about on its own axis—something like the spin of the
earth—and it is the current from this spin that gives the magnetic
field in iron. (We say “something like the spin of the earth”
because the question is so deep in quantum mechanics that the
classical ideas do not really describe things too well.) In most
substances, some electrons spin one way and some spin the other, so
the magnetism cancels out, but in iron—for a mysterious reason which
we will discuss later—many of the electrons are spinning with their
axes lined up, and that is the source of the magnetism.

<p class="p">The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII19">1.9</a>) was
discovered theoretically by
Maxwell and is of great importance.
It
says that changing <em class="emph">electric</em> fields produce magnetic effects. In
fact, without this term the equation would not make sense, because
without it there could be no currents in circuits that are not
complete loops. But such currents do exist, as we can see in the
following example. Imagine a capacitor made of two flat plates. It is
being charged by a current that flows toward one plate and away from
the other, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch1-F10">1–10</a>. We draw a curve $C$
around one of the wires and fill it in with a surface which crosses
the wire, as shown by the surface $S_1$ in the figure. According to
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII19">1.9</a>), the circulation of $\FLPB$ around $C$
(times $c^2$) is given by the current in the wire (divided by $\epsO$). But
what if we fill in the curve with a <em class="emph">different</em> surface $S_2$,
which is shaped like a bowl and passes between the plates of the
capacitor, staying always away from the wire? There is certainly no
current through this surface. But, surely, just changing the location
of an imaginary surface is not going to change a real magnetic field!
The circulation of $\FLPB$ must be what it was before. The first term
on the right-hand side of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII19">1.9</a>) does, indeed,
combine with the second term to give the same result for the two
surfaces $S_1$ and $S_2$. For $S_2$ the circulation of $\FLPB$ is
given in terms of the rate of change of the flux of $\FLPE$ between
the plates of the capacitor. And it works out that the changing $\FLPE$
is related to the current in just the way required for
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII19">1.9</a>) to be correct.
Maxwell saw that it was needed, and

<p class="p">With the setup shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch1-F6">1–6</a> we can demonstrate
another of the laws of electromagnetism. We disconnect the ends of the
hanging wire from the battery and connect them to a
galvanometer which
tells us when there is a current through the wire. When we <em class="emph">push</em>
the wire sideways through the magnetic field of the magnet, we observe
a current. Such an effect is again just another consequence of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII11">1.1</a>)—the electrons in the wire feel the
force $\FLPF=q\FLPv\times\FLPB$. The electrons have a sidewise velocity
because they move with the wire. This $\FLPv$ with a vertical $\FLPB$
from the magnet results in a force on the electrons directed
<em class="emph">along</em> the wire, which starts the electrons moving toward the
galvanometer.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S4-p16" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose, however, that we leave the wire alone and move the magnet. We
guess from relativity that it should make no difference, and indeed,
we observe a similar current in the galvanometer. How does the
magnetic field produce forces on charges at rest? According to
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII11">1.1</a>) there must be an electric field. A moving magnet
must make an electric field. How that happens is said quantitatively by
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII17">1.7</a>). This equation describes many phenomena of great
practical interest, such as those that occur in electric generators and
transformers.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S4-p17" class="para">
<p class="p">The most remarkable consequence of our equations is that the
combination of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII17">1.7</a>) and Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII19">1.9</a>)
contains the explanation of the radiation of electromagnetic effects
over large distances. The reason is roughly something like this:
suppose that somewhere we have a magnetic field which is increasing
because, say, a current is turned on suddenly in a wire. Then by
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII17">1.7</a>) there must be a circulation of an electric field.
As the electric field builds up to produce its circulation, then
according to Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII19">1.9</a>) a magnetic circulation will be
generated. But the building up of <em class="emph">this</em> magnetic field will
produce a new circulation of the electric field, and so on. In this way
fields work their way through space without the need of charges or
currents except at their source. That is the way we <em class="emph">see</em> each
other! It is all in the equations of the electromagnetic fields.</p>

<span class="tag">1–5</span>What are the fields?</h3>
<div id="Ch1-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We now make a few remarks on our way of looking at this subject. You
may be saying: “All this business of fluxes and circulations is
pretty abstract. There are electric fields at every point in space;
then there are these ‘laws.’ But what is <em class="emph">actually</em> happening?
Why can’t you explain it, for instance, by whatever it <em class="emph">is</em> that
goes between the charges.” Well, it depends on your prejudices. Many
physicists used to say that direct action with nothing in between was
inconceivable. (How could they find an idea inconceivable when it had
already been conceived?) They would say: “Look, the only forces we
know are the direct action of one piece of matter on another. It is
impossible that there can be a force with nothing to transmit it.”
But what really happens when we study the “direct action” of one
piece of matter right against another? We discover that it is not one
piece right against the other; they are slightly separated, and there
are electrical forces acting on a tiny scale. Thus we find that we are
going to explain so-called direct-contact action in terms of the
picture for electrical forces. It is certainly not sensible to try to
insist that an electrical force has to look like the old, familiar,
muscular push or pull, when it will turn out that the muscular pushes
and pulls are going to be interpreted as electrical forces! The only
sensible question is what is the <em class="emph">most convenient</em> way to look at
electrical effects. Some people prefer to represent them as the
interaction at a distance of charges, and to use a complicated
law. Others love the field lines. They draw field lines all the time,
and feel that writing $\FLPE$’s and $\FLPB$’s is too abstract. The
field lines, however, are only a crude way of describing a field, and
it is very difficult to give the correct, quantitative laws directly
in terms of field lines. Also, the ideas of the field lines do not
contain the deepest principle of electrodynamics, which is the
superposition principle. Even though we know how the field lines look
for one set of charges and what the field lines look like for another
set of charges, we don’t get any idea about what the field line
patterns will look like when both sets are present together. From the
mathematical standpoint, on the other hand, superposition is easy—we
simply add the two vectors. The field lines have some advantage in
giving a vivid picture, but they also have some disadvantages. The
direct interaction way of thinking has great advantages when thinking
of electrical charges at rest, but has great disadvantages when
dealing with charges in rapid motion.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">The best way is to use the abstract field idea. That it is abstract is
unfortunate, but necessary. The attempts to try to represent the
electric field as the motion of some kind of gear wheels, or in terms
of lines, or of stresses in some kind of material have used up more
effort of physicists than it would have taken simply to get the right
answers about electrodynamics. It is interesting that the correct
equations for the behavior of light were worked out by
MacCullagh in 1839.
But people said to him: “Yes, but there is no real material
whose mechanical properties could possibly satisfy those equations,
and since light is an oscillation that must vibrate in
<em class="emph">something</em>, we cannot believe this abstract equation business.”
If people had been more open-minded, they might have believed in the
right equations for the behavior of light a lot earlier than they did.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">In the case of the magnetic field we can make the following point:
Suppose that you finally succeeded in making up a picture of the
magnetic field in terms of some kind of lines or of gear wheels
running through space. Then you try to explain what happens to two
charges moving in space, both at the same speed and parallel to each
other. Because they are moving, they will behave like two currents and
will have a magnetic field associated with them (like the currents in
the wires of Fig. <a href="#Ch1-F8">1–8</a>). An observer who was riding
along with the two charges, however, would see both charges as
stationary, and would say that there is <em class="emph">no</em> magnetic field. The
“gear wheels” or “lines” disappear when you ride along with the
object! All we have done is to invent a <em class="emph">new</em> problem. How can
the gear wheels disappear?! The people who draw field lines are in a
similar difficulty. Not only is it not possible to say whether the
field lines move or do not move with charges—they may disappear
completely in certain coordinate frames.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">What we are saying, then, is that magnetism is really a relativistic
effect. In the case of the two charges we just considered, travelling
parallel to each other, we would expect to have to make relativistic
corrections to their motion, with terms of order $v^2/c^2$. These
corrections must correspond to the magnetic force. But what about the
force between the two wires in our experiment (Fig. <a href="#Ch1-F8">1–8</a>).
There the magnetic force is the <em class="emph">whole</em> force. It didn’t look like
a “relativistic correction.” Also, if we estimate the velocities of
the electrons in the wire (you can do this yourself), we find that their
average speed along the wire is about $0.01$ centimeter per second.
So $v^2/c^2$ is about $10^{-25}$. Surely a negligible “correction.” But
no! Although the magnetic force is, in this case, $10^{-25}$ of the
“normal” electrical force between the moving electrons, remember that
the “normal” electrical forces have disappeared because of the almost
perfect balancing out—because the wires have the same number of
protons as electrons. The balance is much more precise than one part
in $10^{25}$, and the small relativistic term which we call the magnetic
force is the only term left. It becomes the dominant term.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch1-S5-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">It is the near-perfect cancellation of electrical effects which
allowed relativity effects (that is, magnetism) to be studied and the
correct equations—to order $v^2/c^2$—to be discovered, even though
physicists didn’t <em class="emph">know</em> that’s what was happening. And that is
why, when relativity was discovered, the electromagnetic laws didn’t
need to be changed. They—unlike mechanics—were already correct to
a precision of $v^2/c^2$.</p>

the only phenomena known to the Greeks in which the effects of
electricity or magnetism were apparent. The reason that these were the
only phenomena that appeared is due primarily to the fantastic
precision of the balancing of charges that we mentioned earlier. Study
by scientists who came after the Greeks uncovered one new phenomenon
