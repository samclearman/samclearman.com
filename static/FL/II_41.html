<div id="Ch41-S1" class="section">
<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">41–1</span>Viscosity</h3>
<div id="Ch41-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In the last chapter we discussed the behavior of water, disregarding
the phenomenon of viscosity. Now we would like to discuss the
phenomena of the flow of fluids, <em class="emph">including</em> the effects of
viscosity. We want to look at the <em class="emph">real behavior</em> of fluids. We
will describe qualitatively the actual behavior of the fluids under
various different circumstances so that you will get some feel for the
subject. Although you will see some complicated equations and hear
about some complicated things, it is not our purpose that you should
learn all these things. This is, in a sense, a “cultural” chapter
which will give you some idea of the way the world is. There is only
one item which is worth learning, and that is the simple definition of
viscosity which we will come to in a moment. The rest is only for your
entertainment.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch41-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">In the last chapter we found that the laws of motion of a fluid are
contained in the equation
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:41:1}
\ddp{\FLPv}{t}+(\FLPv\cdot\FLPnabla)\FLPv=
-\frac{\FLPgrad{p}}{\rho}-\FLPgrad{\phi}+
\frac{\FLPf_{\text{visc}}}{\rho}.
\end{equation}

In our “dry” water approximation we left out the last term, so we
were neglecting all viscous effects. Also, we sometimes made an
additional approximation by considering the fluid as incompressible;
then we had the additional equation
\begin{equation*}
\FLPdiv{\FLPv}=0.
\end{equation*}

This last approximation is often quite good—particularly when flow
speeds are much slower than the speed of sound. But in real fluids it
is almost never true that we can neglect the internal friction that we
call viscosity; most of the interesting things that happen come from
it in one way or another. For example, we saw that in “dry” water
the circulation never changes—if there is none to start out with,
there will never be any. Yet, circulation in fluids is an everyday
occurrence. We must fix up our theory.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch41-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We begin with an important experimental fact. When we worked out the
flow of “dry” water around or past a cylinder—the so-called
“potential flow”—we had no reason not to permit the water to have
a velocity tangent to the surface; only the normal component had to be
zero. We took no account of the possibility that there might be a
shear force between the liquid and the solid. It turns out—although
it is not at all self-evident—that in all circumstances where it has
been experimentally checked, the <em class="emph">velocity of a fluid is exactly
zero at the surface of a solid</em>. You have noticed, no doubt, that the
blade of a fan will collect a thin layer of dust—and that it is
still there after the fan has been churning up the air. You can see
the same effect even on the great fan of a wind tunnel. Why isn’t the
dust blown off by the air? In spite of the fact that the fan blade is
moving at high speed through the air, the speed of the air relative to
the fan blade goes to zero right at the surface. So the very smallest
dust particles are not disturbed.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> We must modify
the theory to agree with the experimental fact that in all ordinary
fluids, the molecules next to a solid surface have zero velocity
(relative to the surface).<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a></p>

<span class="tag">Fig. 41–1.</span>Viscous drag between two parallel plates.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch41-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We originally characterized a liquid by the fact that if you put a
shearing stress on it—no matter how small—it would give way. It
flows. In static situations, there are no shear stresses. But before
equilibrium is reached—as long as you still push on it—there can
be shear forces. <em class="emph">Viscosity</em> describes these shear forces which
exist in a moving fluid. To get a measure of the shear forces during
the motion of a fluid, we consider the following kind of
experiment. Suppose that we have two solid plane surfaces with water
between them, as in Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F1">41–1</a>, and we keep one stationary while
moving the other parallel to it at the slow speed $v_0$. If you
measure the force required to keep the upper plate moving, you find
that it is proportional to the area of the plates and to $v_0/d$,
where $d$ is the distance between the plates. So the shear
stress $F/A$ is proportional to $v_0/d$:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{F}{A}=\eta\,\frac{v_0}{d}.
\end{equation*}
The constant of proportionality $\eta$ is called the <em class="emph">coefficient
of viscosity</em>.</p>

\begin{equation}

<p class="p">As an example of the application of these ideas, we consider the
motion of a fluid between two coaxial cylinders. Let the inner one
have the radius $a$ and the peripheral velocity $v_a$, and let the
outer one have radius $b$ and velocity $v_b$. See Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F3">41–3</a>. We
might ask, what is the velocity distribution between the cylinders? To
answer this question, we begin by finding a formula for the viscous
shear in the fluid at a distance $r$ from the axis. From the symmetry
of the problem, we can assume that the flow is always tangential and
that its magnitude depends only on $r$; $v=v(r)$. If we watch a speck
in the water at the radius $r$, its coordinates as a function of time
are
\begin{equation*}
x=r\cos\omega t,\quad
y=r\sin\omega t,

(S_{xy})_{y=0}=\eta r\,\ddt{\omega}{r}.

the shear stress by the moment arm $r$ and the area $2\pi rl$ (where
$l$ is the length of the cylinder). We get

must be independent of $r$. In other words, $r^3\,d\omega/dr$ is equal
to some constant, say $A$, and
\begin{equation}

Integrating, we find that $\omega$ varies with $r$ as

The constants $A$ and $B$ are to be determined to fit the conditions

It is proportional to the relative angular velocities of the two

viscosity is built this way. One cylinder—say the outer one—is on
pivots but is held stationary by a spring balance which measures the
torque on it, while the inner one is rotated at a constant angular

It is usually more convenient to use the <em class="emph">specific viscosity</em>,
which is $\eta$ divided by the density $\rho$. The values for water

<p class="p">We now go to a general theory of viscous flow—at least in the most
general form known to man. We already understand that the shear stress
components are proportional to the spatial derivatives of the various
velocity components such as $\ddpl{v_x}{y}$
or $\ddpl{v_y}{x}$. However, in the general case of a <em class="emph">compressible</em>
fluid there is another term in the stress which depends on other
derivatives of the velocity. The general expression is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:41:13}
S_{ij}=\eta\biggl(\ddp{v_i}{x_j}+\ddp{v_j}{x_i}\biggr)+
\eta'\,\delta_{ij}(\FLPdiv{\FLPv}),
\end{equation}

where $x_i$ is any one of the rectangular coordinates $x$, $y$,
or $z$, and $v_i$ is any one of the rectangular coordinates of the
velocity. (The symbol $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta which
is $1$ when $i=j$ and $0$ for $i\neq j$.)  The additional term adds
$\eta'\,\FLPdiv{\FLPv}$ to all the diagonal elements $S_{ii}$ of the
stress tensor. If the liquid is incompressible $\FLPdiv{\FLPv}=0$, and
this extra term doesn’t appear. So it has to do with internal forces
during compression. So two constants are required to describe the
liquid, just as we had two constants to describe a homogeneous elastic
solid. The coefficient $\eta$ is the “ordinary” coefficient of
viscosity which we have already encountered. It is also called the
<em class="emph">first coefficient of viscosity</em> or the “shear viscosity
coefficient,” and the new coefficient $\eta'$ is called the
<em class="emph">second coefficient of viscosity</em>.</p>

$\FLPf_{\text{visc}}$, so we can put it into Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII411">41.1</a>)
to get the equation of motion for a real fluid. The force on a small
cubical volume element of a fluid is the resultant of the forces on
all the six faces. Taking them two at a time, we will get differences
that depend on the derivatives of the stresses, and, therefore, on the
second derivatives of the velocity. This is nice because it will get
us back to a vector equation. The component of the viscous force per
unit volume in the direction of the rectangular coordinate $x_i$ is

Usually, the variation of the viscosity coefficients with position is
not significant and can be neglected. Then, the viscous force per unit
volume contains only second derivatives of the velocity. We saw in
Chapter <a href="II_39.html">39</a> that the most general form of second derivatives
that can occur in a vector equation is the sum of a term in the
Laplacian ($\FLPdiv{\FLPnabla}\FLPv=\nabla^2\FLPv$), and a term in the
gradient of the divergence $\bigl(\FLPgrad{(\FLPdiv{\FLPv})}\bigr)$.
Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4114">41.14</a>) is just such a sum with the
coefficients $\eta$ and $(\eta+\eta')$. We get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:41:15}
\FLPf_{\text{visc}}=\eta\,\nabla^2\FLPv+(\eta+\eta')\,
\FLPgrad{(\FLPdiv{\FLPv})}.
\end{equation}

In the incompressible case, $\FLPdiv{\FLPv}=0$, and the viscous force
per unit volume is just $\eta\,\nabla^2\FLPv$. That is all that many
people use; however, if you should want to calculate the absorption of
sound in a fluid, you would need the second term.</p>

viscous equations can be solved by man today only for a few special
cases. So some of what we will tell you is based on experimental

think that we would have to give a whole series of cases for
different $V$’s, different $D$’s, and so on. However, that is not the case. All
the different possible solutions correspond to different values of
<em class="emph">one parameter</em>. This is the most important general thing we can
say about viscous flow. To see why this is so, notice first that the
viscosity and density appear only in the ratio $\eta/\rho$—the
<em class="emph">specific</em> viscosity. That reduces the number of independent
parameters to three. Now suppose we measure all distances in the only
length that appears in the problem, the diameter $D$ of the cylinder;
that is, we substitute for $x$, $y$, $z$, the new variables $x'$,
$y'$, $z'$ with
\begin{equation*}
x=x'D,\quad
y=y'D,\quad
z=z'D.

Then $D$ disappears from (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4119">41.19</a>). In the same way, if we
measure all velocities in terms of $V$—that is, we set $v=v'V$—we
get rid of the $V$, and $v'$ is just equal to $1$ at large
distances. Since we have fixed our units of length and velocity, our

example, that if we solve the problem of the flow for one velocity $V_1$
and a certain cylinder diameter $D_1$, and then ask about the flow for a
different diameter $D_2$ and a different fluid, the flow will be the
same for the velocity $V_2$ which gives the same Reynolds number—that
is, when
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:41:25}
\ReynoldsR_1=\frac{\rho_1}{\eta_1}\,V_1D_1=
\ReynoldsR_2=\frac{\rho_2}{\eta_2}\,V_2D_2.
\end{equation}

For any two situations which have the same Reynolds number, the flows
will “look” the same—in terms of the appropriate scaled $x'$, $y'$,
$z'$, and $t'$. This is an important proposition because it
means that we can determine what the behavior of the flow of air past
an airplane wing will be without having to build an airplane and try
it. We can, instead, make a model and make measurements using a
velocity that gives the same Reynolds number. This is the principle
which allows us to apply the results of “wind-tunnel” measurements
on small-scale airplanes, or “model-basin” results on scale model
boats, to the full-scale objects. Remember, however, that we can only
do this provided the compressibility of the fluid can be
neglected. Otherwise, a new quantity enters—the speed of sound. And
different situations will really correspond to each other only if the
ratio of $V$ to the sound speed is also the same. This latter ratio is
called the <em class="emph">Mach number</em>. So, for velocities near the speed of
sound or above, the flows are the same in two situations if
<em class="emph">both</em> the <em class="emph">Mach number</em> and the <em class="emph">Reynolds number</em> are

over the cylinder. We will give a qualitative description of the flow
of a real fluid. There are many things we might want to know about
such a flow—for instance, what is the drag force on the cylinder?
The drag force on a cylinder is plotted in Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F4">41–4</a> as a function
of $\ReynoldsR$—which is proportional to the air speed $V$ if
everything else is held fixed. What is actually plotted is the
so-called <em class="emph">drag coefficient</em> $C_D$, which is a
dimensionless number equal to the force divided by $\tfrac{1}{2}\rho
V^2Dl$, where $D$ is the diameter, $l$ is the length of the cylinder,
and $\rho$ is the density of the liquid:
\begin{equation*}
C_D=\frac{F}{\tfrac{1}{2}\rho V^2Dl}.

The coefficient of drag varies in a rather complicated way, giving us
a pre-hint that something rather interesting and complicated is
happening in the flow. We will now describe the nature of flow for the
different ranges of the Reynolds number. First, when the Reynolds
number is very small, the flow is quite steady; that is, the velocity
is constant at any place, and the flow goes around the cylinder. The
actual distribution of the flow lines is, however, not like it is in
potential flow. They are solutions of a somewhat different
equation. When the velocity is very low or, what is equivalent, when
the viscosity is very high so the stuff is like honey, then the
inertial terms are negligible and the flow is described by the
equation
\begin{equation*}
\nabla^2\FLPOmega=\FLPzero.
\end{equation*}

This equation was first solved by Stokes. He also solved the same
problem for a sphere. If you have a small sphere moving under such
conditions of low Reynolds number, the force needed to drag it is
equal to $6\pi\eta aV$, where $a$ is the radius of the sphere and $V$
is its velocity. This is a very useful formula because it tells the
speed at which tiny grains of dirt (or other particles which can be
approximated as spheres) move through a fluid under a given
force—as, for instance, in a centrifuge, or in sedimentation, or
diffusion. In the low Reynolds number region—for $\ReynoldsR$ less
than $1$—the lines of $\FLPv$ around a <em class="emph">cylinder</em> are as drawn
in Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F5">41–5</a>.</p>

<p class="p">If we now increase the fluid speed to get a Reynolds number somewhat
greater than $1$, we find that the flow is different. There is a
circulation behind the sphere, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F6">41–6</a>(b). It is still
an open question as to whether there is always a circulation there
even at the smallest Reynolds number or whether things suddenly change
at a certain Reynolds number. It used to be thought that the
circulation grew continuously. But it is now thought that it appears
suddenly, and it is certain that the circulation increases
with $\ReynoldsR$. In any case, there is a different character to the flow
for $\ReynoldsR$ in the region from about $10$ to $30$. There is a
pair of vortices behind the cylinder.</p>

<p class="p">The flow changes again by the time we get to a number of $40$ or so.
There is suddenly a complete change in the character of the motion. What
happens is that one of the vortices behind the cylinder gets so long
that it breaks off and travels downstream with the fluid. Then the fluid
curls around behind the cylinder and makes a new vortex. The vortices
peel off alternately on each side, so an instantaneous view of the flow
looks roughly as sketched in Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F6">41–6</a>(c). The stream of
vortices is called a “Kármán vortex street.”  They always appear
for $\ReynoldsR&gt;40$. We show a photograph of such a flow in
Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F7">41–7</a>.</p>

and <a href="#Ch41-F6">41–6</a>(b) or <a href="#Ch41-F6">41–6</a>(a) is almost a complete
difference in regime. In Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F6">41–6</a>(a) or (b), the
velocity is constant, whereas in Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F6">41–6</a>(c), the velocity
at any point varies with time. There is no steady solution
above $\ReynoldsR=40$—which we have marked on Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F4">41–4</a>
by a dashed line. For these higher Reynolds numbers, the flow varies
with time but in a <em class="emph">regular</em>, cyclic fashion.</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch41-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We can get a physical idea of how these vortices are produced. We know
that the fluid velocity must be zero at the surface of the cylinder
and that it also increases rapidly away from that surface. Vorticity
is created by this large local variation in fluid velocity. Now when
the main stream velocity is low enough, there is sufficient time for
this vorticity to diffuse out of the thin region near the solid
surface where it is produced and to grow into a large region of
vorticity. This physical picture should help to prepare us for the
next change in the nature of the flow as the main stream velocity,
or $\ReynoldsR$, is increased still more.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch41-S4-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">As the velocity gets higher and higher, there is less and less time
for the vorticity to diffuse into a larger region of fluid. By the
time we reach a Reynolds number of several hundred, the vorticity
begins to fill in a thin band, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F6">41–6</a>(d). In this
layer the flow is chaotic and irregular. The region is called the
<em class="emph">boundary layer</em> and this irregular flow
region works its way farther and farther upstream as $\ReynoldsR$ is
increased. In the turbulent region, the velocities are very irregular
and “noisy”; also the flow is no longer two-dimensional but twists and
turns in all three dimensions. There is still a regular alternating
motion superimposed on the turbulent one.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch41-S4-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">As the Reynolds number is increased further, the turbulent region
works its way forward until it reaches the point where the flow lines
leave the cylinder—for flows somewhat above $\ReynoldsR=10^5$. The
flow is as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F6">41–6</a>(e), and we have what is called a
“turbulent boundary layer.” Also, there is a drastic change in, the
drag force; it drops by a large factor, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F4">41–4</a>. In
this speed region, the drag force actually <em class="emph">decreases</em> with
increasing speed. There seems to be little evidence of periodicity.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch41-S4-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">What happens for still larger Reynolds numbers? As we increase the
speed further, the wake increases in size again and the drag
increases. The latest experiments—which go up to $\ReynoldsR=10^7$
or so—indicate that a new periodicity appears in the wake, either
because the whole wake is oscillating back and forth in a gross motion
or because some new kind of vortex is occurring together with an
irregular noisy motion. The details are as yet not entirely clear, and
are still being studied experimentally.</p>

<span class="tag">41–5</span>The limit of zero viscosity</h3>
<div id="Ch41-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We would like to point out that none of the flows we have described are
anything like the potential flow solution we found in the preceding
chapter. This is, at first sight, quite surprising. After all,
$\ReynoldsR$ is proportional to $1/\eta$. So $\eta$ going to zero is
equivalent to $\ReynoldsR$ going to infinity. And if we take the limit
of large $\ReynoldsR$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4123">41.23</a>), we get rid of the
right-hand side and get just the equations of the last chapter. Yet, you
would find it hard to believe that the highly turbulent flow
at $\ReynoldsR=10^7$ was approaching the smooth flow computed from the
equations of “dry” water. How can it be that as we
approach $\ReynoldsR=\infty$, the flow described by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4123">41.23</a>) gives
a completely different solution from the one we obtained taking $\eta=0$
to start out with? The answer is very interesting. Note that the
right-hand term of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4123">41.23</a>) has $1/\ReynoldsR$ times a
<em class="emph">second derivative</em>. It is a higher derivative than any other
derivative in the equation. What happens is that although the
coefficient $1/\ReynoldsR$ is small, there are very rapid variations
of $\FLPOmega$ in the space near the surface. These rapid variations
compensate for the small coefficient, and the product <em class="emph">does not go
to zero</em> with increasing $\ReynoldsR$. The solutions do not approach the
limiting case as the coefficient of $\nabla^2\FLPOmega$ goes to zero.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch41-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">You may be wondering, “What is the fine-grain turbulence and how does
it maintain itself? How can the vorticity which is made somewhere at the
edge of the cylinder generate so much noise in the background?” The
answer is again interesting. Vorticity has a tendency to amplify itself.
If we forget for a moment about the diffusion of vorticity which causes
a loss, the laws of flow say (as we have seen) that the vortex lines are
carried along with the fluid, at the velocity $\FLPv$. We can imagine a
certain number of lines of $\FLPOmega$ which are being distorted and
twisted by the complicated flow pattern of $\FLPv$. This pulls the lines
closer together and mixes them all up. Lines that were simple before
will get knotted and pulled close together. They will be longer and
tighter together. The strength of the vorticity will increase and its
irregularities—the pluses and minuses—will, in general, increase. So
the magnitude of vorticity in three dimensions increases as we twist the
fluid about.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch41-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">You might well ask, “When is the potential flow a satisfactory theory
at all?” In the first place, it is satisfactory outside the turbulent
region where the vorticity has not entered appreciably by
diffusion. By making special streamlined bodies, we can keep the
turbulent region as small as possible; the flow around airplane
wings—which are carefully designed—is almost entirely true
potential flow.</p>

<p class="p">It is possible to demonstrate that the complex and shifting character of
the flow past a cylinder is not special but that the great variety of
flow possibilities occurs generally. We have worked out in
Section <a href="#Ch41-S1">41–1</a> a solution for the viscous flow between two
cylinders, and we can compare the results with what actually happens. If
we take two concentric cylinders with an oil in the space between them
and put a fine aluminum powder as a suspension in the oil, the flow is
easy to see. Now if we turn the outer cylinder slowly, nothing
unexpected happens; see Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F8">41–8</a>(a). Alternatively, if we
turn the inner cylinder slowly, nothing very striking occurs. However,
if we turn the inner cylinder at a higher rate, we get a surprise. The
fluid breaks into horizontal bands, as indicated in
Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F8">41–8</a>(b). When the outer cylinder rotates at a similar
rate with the inner one at rest, no such effect occurs. How can it be
that there is a difference between rotating the inner or the out
cylinder? After all, the flow pattern we derived in
Section <a href="#Ch41-S1">41–1</a> depended only on $\omega_b-\omega_a$. We can
get the answer by looking at the cross sections shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F9">41–9</a>. When the inner layers of the fluid are moving
more rapidly than the outer ones, they tend to move <em class="emph">outward</em>—the
centrifugal force
is larger than the pressure holding them in place. A
whole layer cannot move out uniformly because the outer layers are in
the way. It must break into cells and circulate, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F9">41–9</a>(b). It is like the convection currents in a room
which has hot air at the bottom. When the inner cylinder is at rest and
the outer cylinder has a high velocity, the centrifugal
forces build up
a pressure gradient which keeps everything in equilibrium—see
Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F9">41–9</a>(c) (as in a room with hot air at the top).

<p class="p">Now let’s speed up the inner cylinder. At first, the number of bands
increases. Then suddenly you see the bands become wavy, as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F8">41–8</a>(c), and the waves travel around the cylinder. The
speed of these waves is easily measured. For high rotation speeds they
approach $1/3$ the speed of the inner cylinder. And no one knows why!
There’s a challenge. A simple number like $1/3$, and no explanation. In
fact, the whole mechanism of the wave formation is not very well
understood; yet it is steady laminar flow.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch41-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">If we now start rotating the outer cylinder also—but in the opposite
direction—the flow pattern starts to break up. We get wavy regions
alternating with apparently quiet regions, as sketched in
Fig. <a href="#Ch41-F8">41–8</a>(d), making a spiral pattern. In these “quiet”
regions, however, we can see that the flow is really quite irregular; it
is, in fact completely turbulent. The wavy regions also begin to show
irregular turbulent flow. If the cylinders are rotated still more
rapidly, the whole flow becomes chaotically turbulent.</p>

<div id="Ch41-S6-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">In this simple experiment we see many interesting regimes of flow
which are quite different, and yet which are all contained in our
simple equation for various values of the one parameter $\ReynoldsR$.
With our rotating cylinders, we can see many of the
effects which occur in the flow past a cylinder: first, there is a
steady flow; second, a flow sets in which varies in time but in a
regular, smooth way; finally, the flow becomes completely
irregular. You have all seen the same effects in the column of smoke
rising from a cigarette in quiet air. There is a smooth steady column
followed by a series of twistings as the stream of smoke begins to
break up, ending finally in an irregular churning cloud of smoke.</p>

<p class="p">The main lesson to be learned from all of this is that a tremendous
variety of behavior is hidden in the simple set of equations
in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4123">41.23</a>). All the solutions are for the same equations,
only with different values of $\ReynoldsR$. We have no reason to think
that there are any terms missing from these equations. The only
difficulty is that we do not have the mathematical power today to
analyze them except for very small Reynolds numbers—that is, in the
completely viscous case. That we have written an equation does not
remove from the flow of fluids its charm or mystery or its surprise.</p>

<div id="Ch41-S6-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">If such variety is possible in a simple equation with only one
parameter, how much more is possible with more complex equations!
Perhaps the fundamental equation that describes the swirling nebulae
and the condensing, revolving, and exploding stars and galaxies is
just a simple equation for the hydrodynamic behavior of nearly pure
hydrogen gas. Often, people in some unjustified fear of physics say
you can’t write an equation for life. Well, perhaps we can. As a
matter of fact, we very possibly already have the equation to a
sufficient approximation when we write the equation of quantum
mechanics:
\begin{equation*}
H\psi=-\frac{\hbar}{i}\,\ddp{\psi}{t}.
\end{equation*}

We have just seen that the complexities of things can so easily and
dramatically escape the simplicity of the equations which describe
them. Unaware of the scope of simple equations, man has often
concluded that nothing short of God, not mere equations, is required
to explain the complexities of the world.</p>

primitive, halting, and confused way to try to determine what new
qualitative features may come out, or what new qualitative forms are a
consequence of the equations. Our equations for the sun, for example,
as a ball of hydrogen gas, describe a sun without sunspots, without
the rice-grain structure of the surface, without prominences, without
coronas. Yet, all of these are really in the equations; we just
