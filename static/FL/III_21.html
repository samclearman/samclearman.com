<p class="p">This lecture is only for entertainment. I would like to give the
lecture in a somewhat different style‚Äîjust to see how it works
out. It‚Äôs not a part of the course‚Äîin the sense that it is not
supposed to be a last minute effort to teach you something new. But,
rather, I imagine that I‚Äôm giving a seminar or research report on the
subject to a more advanced audience, to people who have already been
educated in quantum mechanics. The main difference between a seminar
and a regular lecture is that the seminar speaker does not carry out
all the steps, or all the algebra. He says: ‚ÄúIf you do such and such,
this is what comes out,‚Äù instead of showing all of the details. So in
this lecture I‚Äôll describe the ideas all the way along but just give
you the <em class="emph">results</em> of the computations. You should realize that
you‚Äôre not supposed to understand everything immediately, but believe
(more or less) that things would come out if you went through the
steps.</p>

<div id="Ch21-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Ordinarily, the wave function which appears in the Schr√∂dinger
equation applies to only one or two particles. And the wave function
itself is not something that has a classical meaning‚Äîunlike the
electric field, or the vector potential, or things of that kind. The
wave function for a single particle <em class="emph">is</em> a ‚Äúfield‚Äù‚Äîin the
sense that it is a function of position‚Äîbut it does not generally
have a classical significance. Nevertheless, there are some situations
in which a quantum mechanical wave function <em class="emph">does</em> have classical
significance, and they are the ones I would like to take up. The
peculiar quantum mechanical behavior of matter on a small scale
doesn‚Äôt usually make itself felt on a large scale except in the
standard way that it produces Newton‚Äôs laws‚Äîthe laws of the
so-called classical mechanics. But there are certain situations in
which the peculiarities of quantum mechanics can come out in a special
way on a large scale.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch21-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">At low temperatures, when the energy of a system has been reduced
very, very low, instead of a large number of states being involved,
only a very, very small number of states near the ground state are
involved. Under those circumstances the quantum mechanical character
of that ground state can appear on a macroscopic scale. It is the
purpose of this lecture to show a connection between quantum mechanics
and large-scale effects‚Äînot the usual discussion of the way that
quantum mechanics reproduces Newtonian mechanics on the average, but a
special situation in which quantum mechanics will produce its own
characteristic effects on a large or ‚Äúmacroscopic‚Äù scale.</p>

in which instead of having a continuous situation we have a line of
atoms along the $x$-axis with the spacing¬†$b$ and we have an

there‚Äôs a vector potential in the $x$-direction¬†$A_x(x,t)$, the
amplitude to jump will be altered from what it was before by a
factor¬†$\exp[(iq/\hbar)\,A_xb]$, the exponent being $iq/\hbar$¬†times the vector
potential integrated from one atom to the next. For simplicity we will
write¬†$(q/\hbar)A_x\equiv f(x)$, since $A_x$, will, in general, depend
on¬†$x$. If the amplitude to find the electron at the atom¬†‚Äú$n$‚Äù
located at¬†$x$ is called¬†$C(x)\equiv C_n$, then the rate of change of
that amplitude is given by the following equation:

for the electron to have jumped backwards one step from
atom¬†‚Äú$n+1$,‚Äù located at¬†$x+b$. However, in doing so in a vector
potential, the phase of the amplitude must be shifted according to the
rule in Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII211">21.1</a>). If $A_x$ is not changing
appreciably in one atomic spacing, the integral can be written as just
the value of¬†$A_x$ at the midpoint, times the spacing¬†$b$. So
$(iq/\hbar)$¬†times the integral is just¬†$ibf(x+b/2)$. Since the
electron is jumping backwards, I showed this phase shift with a minus
sign. That gives the second piece. In the same manner there‚Äôs a
certain amplitude to have jumped from the other side, but this time we
need the vector potential at a distance¬†$(b/2)$ on the other side
of¬†$x$, times the distance¬†$b$. That gives the third piece. The sum gives
the equation for the amplitude to be at¬†$x$ in a vector potential.</p>

example, if $b$ is zero the right-hand side is just¬†$(E_0-2K)C(x)$, so
in the zeroth approximation the energy is¬†$E_0-2K$. Next comes the terms
in¬†$b$. But because the two exponentials have opposite signs, only even

<p class="p">Now I turn to a second point. An important part of the Schr√∂dinger
equation for a single particle is the idea that the probability to
find the particle at a position is given by the absolute square of the
wave function. It is also characteristic of the quantum mechanics that
probability is conserved in a local sense. When the probability of
finding the electron somewhere decreases, while the probability of the
electron being elsewhere increases (keeping the total probability
unchanged), something must be going on in between. In other words, the
electron has a continuity in the sense that if the probability
decreases at one place and builds up at another place, there must be
some kind of flow between. If you put a wall, for example, in the way,
it will have an influence and the probabilities will not be the
same. So the conservation of probability alone is not the complete
statement of the conservation law, just as the conservation of energy
alone is not as deep and important as the <em class="emph">local</em> conservation of
energy.<a name="footnote_source_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup class="mark">6</sup></a> If energy
is disappearing, there must be a flow of energy to correspond. In the

inflow or an outflow due to some current. This current would be a vector
which could be interpreted this way‚Äîthe $x$-component would be the net
probability per second and per unit area that a particle passes in the

some quantity plus its own complex conjugate, so the whole thing is

zero probability to find the electron at the surface. The total
probability to find the electron somewhere inside the surface is the
volume integral of¬†$P$. But according to Gauss‚Äôs theorem the volume integral of the

the vector potential.</p>

<div id="Ch21-S3-p2" class="para">

about‚Äîwhy there must be something like Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2115">21.15</a>) in
the quantum mechanics. The wave function changes with time according
to the Schr√∂dinger equation in Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII213">21.3</a>). If I would
suddenly change the vector potential, the wave function wouldn‚Äôt
change at the first instant; only its rate of change changes. Now
think of what would happen in the following circumstance. Suppose I
have a long solenoid, in which I can produce a flux of magnetic field
($\FLPB$-field), as shown in Fig.¬†<a href="#Ch21-F2">21‚Äì2</a>. And there is a charged
particle sitting nearby. Suppose this flux nearly instantaneously
builds up from zero to something. I start with zero vector potential
and then I turn on a vector potential. That means that I produce
suddenly a circumferential vector potential¬†$\FLPA$. You‚Äôll remember
that the line integral of¬†$\FLPA$ around a loop is the same as the flux
of¬†$\FLPB$ through the loop.<a name="footnote_source_8" href="#footnote_8"><sup class="mark">8</sup></a> Now what
happens if I suddenly turn on a vector potential?  According to the
quantum mechanical equation the sudden change of¬†$\FLPA$ does not make a
sudden change of¬†$\psi$; the wave function is still the same. So the

flux. During the short time that the flux is rising, there‚Äôs an
electric field generated whose line integral is the rate of change of
the flux with time:
\begin{equation}
\FLPE=-\ddp{\FLPA}{t}.
\end{equation}

That electric field is enormous if the flux is changing rapidly, and
it gives a force on the particle. The force is the charge times the
electric field, and so during the build up of the flux the particle
obtains a total impulse (that is, a change in¬†$m\FLPv$) equal
to¬†$-q\FLPA$. In other words, if you suddenly turn on a vector potential
at a charge, this charge immediately picks up an $mv$-momentum equal
to¬†$-q\FLPA$. But there is something that isn‚Äôt changed immediately
and that‚Äôs the difference between $m\FLPv$ and¬†$-q\FLPA$. And so the
sum¬†$\FLPp=m\FLPv+q\FLPA$ is something which is not changed when you
make a sudden change in the vector potential. This quantity¬†$\FLPp$ is
what we have called the $p$-momentum and is of importance in classical
mechanics in the theory of dynamics, but it also has a direct
significance in quantum mechanics. It depends on the character of the

calculated¬†$\psi$, he wasn‚Äôt calculating the probability of
anything‚Äîthere were no amplitudes at that time‚Äîthe interpretation
was completely different. The atomic nucleus was stationary but there
were currents moving around; the charges¬†$P$ and currents¬†$\FLPJ$ would
generate electromagnetic fields and the thing would radiate light. He
soon found on doing a number of problems that it didn‚Äôt work out quite
right. It was at this point that Born
made an essential contribution to our ideas regarding quantum mechanics.
It was Born who correctly (as far as
we know) interpreted the¬†$\psi$ of the Schr√∂dinger equation in terms of
a probability amplitude‚Äîthat very difficult idea that the square of
the amplitude is not the charge density but is only the probability per
unit volume of finding an electron there, and that when you do find the
electron some place the entire charge is there. That whole idea is due
to Born.</p>

<div id="Ch21-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">The wave function¬†$\psi(\FLPr)$ for an electron in an atom does not,
then, describe a smeared-out electron with a smooth charge
density. The electron is either here, or there, or somewhere else, but
wherever it is, it is a point charge. On the other hand, think of a
situation in which there are an enormous number of particles in
exactly the same state, a very large number of them with exactly the
same wave function. Then what? One of them is here and one of them is
there, and the probability of finding any one of them at a given place
is proportional to¬†$\psi\psi\cconj$. But since there are so many
particles, if I look in any volume¬†$dx\,dy\,dz$ I will generally find
a number close to¬†$\psi\psi\cconj\,dx\,dy\,dz$. So in a situation in
which $\psi$ is the wave function for each of an enormous number of
particles which are all in the same state, $\psi\psi\cconj$ <em class="emph">can</em>
be interpreted as the density of particles. If, under these
circumstances, each particle carries the same charge¬†$q$, we can, in
fact, go further and interpret¬†$\psi\cconj\psi$ as the density of
<em class="emph">electricity</em>. Normally, $\psi\psi\cconj$ is given the dimensions
of a probability density, then $\psi$ should be multiplied by¬†$q$ to
give the dimensions of a charge density. For our present purposes we
can put this constant factor into¬†$\psi$, and take $\psi\psi\cconj$
itself as the electric charge density. With this understanding,
$\FLPJ$ (the current of probability I have calculated) becomes
directly the electric current density.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch21-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">So in the situation in which we can have very many particles in
exactly the same state, there is possible a new physical
interpretation of the wave functions. The charge density and the

classical, macroscopic situations.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch21-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Something similar can happen with neutral particles. When we have the
wave function of a single photon, it is the amplitude to find a photon
somewhere. Although we haven‚Äôt ever written it down there is an
equation for the photon wave function analogous to the Schr√∂dinger
equation for the electron. The photon equation is just the same as
Maxwell‚Äôs equations for the electromagnetic field, and the wave
function is the same as the vector potential¬†$\FLPA$. The wave
function turns out to be just the vector potential. The quantum
physics is the same thing as the classical physics because photons are
noninteracting Bose particles and many of them can be in the same
state‚Äîas you know, they <em class="emph">like</em> to be in the same state. The
moment that you have billions in the same state (that is, in the same
electromagnetic wave), you can measure the wave function, which is the
vector potential, directly. Of course, it worked historically the
other way. The first observations were on situations with many photons
in the same state, and so we were able to discover the correct

<p class="p">As you know, very many metals become superconducting below a certain
temperature<a name="footnote_source_9" href="#footnote_9"><sup class="mark">9</sup></a>‚Äîthe temperature is different for different metals. When you
reduce the temperature sufficiently the metals conduct electricity
without any resistance. This phenomenon has been observed for a very
large number of metals but not for all, and the theory of this
phenomenon has caused a great deal of difficulty. It took a very long
time to understand what was going on inside of superconductors, and I
will only describe enough of it for our present purposes. It turns out
that due to the interactions of the electrons with the vibrations of the
atoms in the lattice, there is a small net effective <em class="emph">attraction</em>
between the electrons. The result is that the electrons form together,
if I may speak very qualitatively and crudely, bound pairs.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch21-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now you know that a single electron is a Fermi particle. But a bound
pair would act as a Bose particle, because if I exchange both
electrons in a pair I change the sign of the wave function twice, and
that means that I don‚Äôt change anything. A pair <em class="emph">is</em> a Bose
particle.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch21-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The energy of pairing‚Äîthat is, the net attraction‚Äîis very, very
weak. Only a tiny temperature is needed to throw the electrons apart
by thermal agitation, and convert them back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù
electrons. But when you make the temperature sufficiently low that
they have to do their very best to get into the absolutely lowest
state; then they do collect in pairs.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch21-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">I don‚Äôt wish you to imagine that the pairs are really held together very
closely like a point particle. As a matter of fact, one of the great
difficulties of understanding this phenomena originally was that that is
not the way things are. The two electrons which form the pair are really
spread over a considerable distance; and the mean distance between pairs
is relatively smaller than the size of a single pair. Several pairs are
occupying the same space at the same time. Both the reason why electrons
in a metal form pairs and an estimate of the energy given up in forming
a pair have been a triumph of recent times. This fundamental point in
the theory of superconductivity was first explained in the theory of
Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer,<a name="footnote_source_10" href="#footnote_10"><sup class="mark">10</sup></a> but that is not the subject of
this seminar. We will accept, however, the idea that the electrons do,
in some manner or other, work in pairs, that we can think of these pairs
as behaving more or less like particles, and that we can therefore talk
about the wave function for a ‚Äúpair.‚Äù</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch21-S5-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now the Schr√∂dinger equation for the pair will be more or less like
Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII213">21.3</a>). There will be one difference in that the
charge¬†$q$ will be twice the charge of an electron. Also, we don‚Äôt
know the inertia‚Äîor effective mass‚Äîfor the pair in the crystal
lattice, so we don‚Äôt know what number to put in for¬†$m$. Nor should we
think that if we go to very high frequencies (or short wavelengths),
this is exactly the right form, because the kinetic energy that
corresponds to very rapidly varying wave functions may be so great as
to break up the pairs. At finite temperatures there are always a few
pairs which are broken up according to the usual Boltzmann theory. The
probability that a pair is broken is proportional
to¬†$\exp(-E_{\text{pair}}/kT)$. The electrons that are not bound in pairs
are called ‚Äúnormal‚Äù electrons and will move around in the crystal in
the ordinary way. I will, however, consider only the situation at
essentially zero temperature‚Äîor, in any case, I will disregard the
complications produced by those electrons which are not in pairs.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch21-S5-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Since electron pairs are bosons, when there are a lot of them in a
given state there is an especially large amplitude for other pairs to
go to the same state. So nearly all of the pairs will be locked down
at the lowest energy in <em class="emph">exactly the same state</em>‚Äîit won‚Äôt be
easy to get one of them into another state. There‚Äôs more amplitude to
go into the same state than into an unoccupied state by the famous
factor¬†$\sqrt{n}$, where $n-1$ is the occupancy of the lowest
state. So we would expect all the pairs to be moving in the same
state.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch21-S5-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">What then will our theory look like? I‚Äôll call¬†$\psi$ the wave
function of a pair in the lowest energy state. However, since
$\psi\psi\cconj$ is going to be proportional to the charge
density¬†$\rho$, I can just as well write $\psi$ as the square root of the
charge density times some phase factor:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:17}
\psi(\FLPr)=\rho^{1/2}(\FLPr)e^{i\theta(\FLPr)},
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ and¬†$\theta$ are real functions of¬†$\FLPr$. (Any complex
function can, of course, be written this way.) It‚Äôs clear what we mean
when we talk about the charge density, but what is the physical
meaning of the phase¬†$\theta$ of the wave function? Well, let‚Äôs see
what happens if we substitute¬†$\psi(\FLPr)$ into
Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2112">21.12</a>), and express the current density in terms of
these new variables $\rho$ and¬†$\theta$. It‚Äôs just a change of variables
and I won‚Äôt go through all the algebra, but it comes out
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:18}
\FLPJ=\frac{\hbar}{m}\biggl(
\FLPgrad{\theta}-\frac{q}{\hbar}\,\FLPA\biggr)\rho.
\end{equation}

Since both the current density and the charge density have a direct
physical meaning for the superconducting electron gas, both $\rho$
and¬†$\theta$ are real things. The phase is just as observable as¬†$\rho$;
it is a piece of the current density¬†$\FLPJ$. The <em class="emph">absolute</em>
phase is not observable, but if the gradient of the phase is known
everywhere, the phase is known except for a constant. You can define
the phase at one point, and then the phase everywhere is determined.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch21-S5-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Incidentally, the equation for the current can be analyzed a little
nicer, when you think that the current density¬†$\FLPJ$ is <em class="emph">in
fact</em> the charge density times the velocity of motion of the fluid of
electrons, or¬†$\rho\FLPv$. Equation¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2118">21.18</a>) is then
equivalent to
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:19}
m\FLPv=\hbar\,\FLPgrad{\theta}-q\FLPA.
\end{equation}

Notice that there are two pieces in the $mv$-momentum; one is a
contribution from the vector potential, and the other, a contribution
from the behavior of the wave function. In other words, the
quantity¬†$\hbar\,\FLPgrad{\theta}$ is just what we have called the

<p class="p">Now we can describe some of the phenomena of superconductivity. First,
there is no electrical resistance. There‚Äôs no resistance because all
the electrons are collectively in the same state. In the ordinary flow
of current you knock one electron or the other out of the regular
flow, gradually deteriorating the general momentum. But here to get
one electron away from what all the others are doing is very hard
because of the tendency of all Bose particles to go in the same

<div id="Ch21-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">It‚Äôs also easy to understand that if you have a piece of metal in the
superconducting state and turn on a magnetic field which isn‚Äôt too
strong (we won‚Äôt go into the details of how strong), the magnetic
field can‚Äôt penetrate the metal. If, as you build up the magnetic
field, any of it were to build up inside the metal, there would be a
rate of change of flux which would produce an electric field, and an
electric field would immediately generate a current which, by Lenz‚Äôs
law, would oppose the flux. Since all the electrons will move
together, an infinitesimal electric field will generate enough current
to oppose completely any applied magnetic field. So if you turn the
field on after you‚Äôve cooled a metal to the superconducting state, it
will be excluded.</p>

superconductor), <em class="emph">the field is expelled</em>. In other words, it starts
up its own current‚Äîand in just the right amount to push the field out.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch21-S6-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We can see the reason for that in the equations, and I‚Äôd like to
explain how. Suppose that we take a piece of superconducting material
which is in one lump. Then in a steady situation of any kind the
divergence of the current must be zero because there‚Äôs no place for it
to go. It is convenient to choose to make the divergence of¬†$\FLPA$
equal to zero. (I should explain why choosing this convention doesn‚Äôt
mean any loss of generality, but I don‚Äôt want to take the time.)
Taking the divergence of Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2118">21.18</a>), then gives that
the Laplacian of¬†$\theta$ is equal to zero. One moment. What about the
variation of¬†$\rho$? I forgot to mention an important point. There is
a background of positive charge in this metal due to the atomic ions
of the lattice. If the charge density¬†$\rho$ is uniform there is no
net charge and no electric field. If there would be any accumulation
of electrons in one region the charge wouldn‚Äôt be neutralized and
there would be a terrific repulsion pushing the electrons
apart.<a name="footnote_source_12" href="#footnote_12"><sup class="mark">12</sup></a> So in
ordinary circumstances the charge density of the electrons in the
superconductor is almost perfectly uniform‚ÄîI can take¬†$\rho$ as a
constant. Now the only way that $\nabla^2\theta$ can be zero
everywhere inside the lump of metal is for¬†$\theta$ to be a
constant. And that means that there is no contribution to¬†$\FLPJ$ from
$p$-momentum. Equation¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2118">21.18</a>) then says that the current
is proportional to $\rho$ times¬†$\FLPA$. So everywhere in a lump of
superconducting material the current is necessarily proportional to
the vector potential:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:20}
\FLPJ=-\rho\,\frac{q}{m}\,\FLPA.
\end{equation}

Since $\rho$ and¬†$q$ have the same (negative) sign, and since $\rho$
is a constant, I can set¬†$-\rho q/m=-(\text{some positive constant})$;
then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:21}
\FLPJ=-(\text{some positive constant})\FLPA.
\end{equation}

This equation was originally proposed by London and
London<a name="footnote_source_13" href="#footnote_13"><sup class="mark">13</sup></a> to explain the

<p class="p">The London equation¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2121">21.21</a>) was proposed to account for
the observed facts of superconductivity including the
Meissner effect.
In recent times, however, there have been some even more
dramatic predictions. One prediction made by London was so peculiar
that nobody paid much attention to it until recently. I will now
discuss it. This time instead of taking a single lump, suppose we take
a <em class="emph">ring</em> whose thickness is large compared to¬†$1/\lambda$, and
try to see what would happen if we started with a magnetic field
through the ring, then cooled it to the superconducting state, and
afterward removed the original source of¬†$\FLPB$. The sequence of
events is sketched in Fig.¬†<a href="#Ch21-F4">21‚Äì4</a>. In the normal state there will be a
field in the body of the ring as sketched in part¬†(a) of the
figure. When the ring is made superconducting, the field is forced
outside of the <em class="emph">material</em> (as we have just seen). There will then
be some flux through the hole of the ring as sketched in part¬†(b). If
the external field is now removed, the lines of field going through
the hole are ‚Äútrapped‚Äù as shown in part¬†(c). The flux¬†$\Phi$ through
the center can‚Äôt decrease because $\ddpl{\Phi}{t}$ must be equal to
the line integral of¬†$\FLPE$ around the ring, which is zero in a
superconductor. As the external field is removed a super current
starts flowing around the ring to keep the flux through the ring a
constant. (It‚Äôs the old eddy-current idea, only with zero resistance.)
These currents will, however, all flow near the surface (down to a
depth¬†$1/\lambda$), as can be shown by the same kind of analysis that
I made for the solid block. These currents can keep the magnetic field
out of the body of the ring, and produce the permanently trapped
magnetic field as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch21-S7-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now, however, there is an essential difference, and our equations
predict a surprising effect. The argument I made above that $\theta$

<p class="p">Well inside the body of the ring the current density¬†$\FLPJ$ is zero;
so Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2118">21.18</a>) gives
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:26}
\hbar\,\FLPgrad{\theta}=q\FLPA.
\end{equation}

Now consider what we get if we take the line integral of¬†$\FLPA$
around a curve¬†$\Gamma$, which goes around the ring near the center of
its cross-section so that it never gets near the surface, as drawn in
Fig.¬†<a href="#Ch21-F5">21‚Äì5</a>. From Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2126">21.26</a>),
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:27}
\hbar\oint\FLPgrad{\theta}\cdot d\FLPs=q\oint\FLPA\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation}

Now you know that the line integral of¬†$\FLPA$ around any loop is
equal to the flux of¬†$\FLPB$ through the loop
\begin{equation*}
\oint\FLPA\cdot d\FLPs=\Phi.
\end{equation*}

Equation¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2127">21.27</a>) then becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:28}
\oint\FLPgrad{\theta}\cdot d\FLPs=\frac{q}{\hbar}\,\Phi.
\end{equation}

The line integral of a gradient from one point to another (say from
point¬†$1$ to point¬†$2$) is the difference of the values of the
function at the two points. Namely,
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^2\FLPgrad{\theta}\cdot d\FLPs=\theta_2-\theta_1.
\end{equation*}

If we let the two end points $1$ and¬†$2$ come together to make a
closed loop you might at first think that $\theta_2$ would
equal¬†$\theta_1$, so that the integral in Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2128">21.28</a>) would
be zero. That would be true for a closed loop in a simply-connected
piece of superconductor, but it is not necessarily true for a
ring-shaped piece. The only physical requirement we can make is that
<em class="emph">there can be only one value of the wave function for each
point</em>. Whatever $\theta$ does as you go around the ring, when you get
back to the starting point the¬†$\theta$ you get must give the same
value for the wave function
\begin{equation*}
\psi=\sqrt{\rho}e^{i\theta}.
\end{equation*}

This will happen if $\theta$ changes by¬†$2\pi n$, where $n$ is any
integer. So if we make one complete turn around the ring the left-hand
side of Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2127">21.27</a>) must be¬†$\hbar\cdot2\pi n$. Using
Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2128">21.28</a>), I get that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:29}
2\pi n\hbar=q\Phi.
\end{equation}

<em class="emph">The trapped flux must always be an integer times¬†$2\pi\hbar/q$!</em>
If you would think of the ring as a classical object with an ideally
perfect (that is, infinite) conductivity, you would think that
whatever flux was initially found through it would just stay
there‚Äîany amount of flux at all could be trapped. But the
quantum-mechanical theory of superconductivity says that the flux can
be zero, or¬†$2\pi\hbar/q$, or¬†$4\pi\hbar/q$, or¬†$6\pi\hbar/q$, and so
on, but no value in between. It must be a multiple of a basic quantum
mechanical unit.</p>

visualize such a flux, think of a tiny cylinder a tenth of a millimeter
in diameter; the magnetic field inside it when it contains this amount
of flux is about one percent of the earth‚Äôs magnetic field. It should be
possible to observe such a flux by a sensitive magnetic measurement.</p>

superconductor was made by electroplating a thin layer of tin on a
one-centimeter length of No.¬†56 ($1.3\times10^{-3}$¬†cm diameter)
copper wire. The tin becomes superconducting below¬†$3.8^\circ$K while
the copper remains a normal metal. The wire was put in a small
controlled magnetic field, and the temperature reduced until the tin
became superconducting. Then the external source of field was
removed. You would expect this to generate a current by Lenz‚Äôs law so
that the flux inside would not change. The little cylinder should now
have magnetic moment proportional to the flux inside. The magnetic
moment was measured by jiggling the wire up and down (like the needle

<p class="p">The Meissner effect
and the flux quantization are two confirmations of
our general ideas. Just for the sake of completeness I would like to
show you what the complete equations of a superconducting fluid would
be from this point of view‚Äîit is rather interesting. Up to this
point I have only put the expression for¬†$\psi$ into equations for
charge density and current. If I put it into the complete
Schr√∂dinger equation I get equations for $\rho$ and¬†$\theta$. It
should be interesting to see what develops, because here we have a
‚Äúfluid‚Äù of electron pairs with a charge density¬†$\rho$ and a
mysterious¬†$\theta$‚Äîwe can try to see what kind of equations we get
for such a ‚Äúfluid‚Äù!  So we substitute the wave function of
Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2117">21.17</a>) into the Schr√∂dinger
equation¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII213">21.3</a>) and remember that $\rho$ and¬†$\theta$ are
real functions of $x$,¬†$y$, $z$, and¬†$t$. If we separate real and
imaginary parts we obtain then two equations. To write them in a shorter
form I will‚Äîfollowing Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2119">21.19</a>)‚Äîwrite
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:31}
\frac{\hbar}{m}\,\FLPgrad{\theta}-\frac{q}{m}\,\FLPA=\FLPv.
\end{equation}

One of the equations I get is then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:32}
\ddp{\rho}{t}=-\FLPdiv{\rho\FLPv}.
\end{equation}

Since $\rho\FLPv$ is first¬†$\FLPJ$, this is just the continuity
equation once more. The other equation I obtain tells how¬†$\theta$
varies; it is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:33}
\hbar\,\ddp{\theta}{t}=-\frac{m}{2}\,v^2-q\phi+
\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\biggl\{
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}\,\nabla^2(\sqrt{\rho})\biggr\}.
\end{equation}

Those who are thoroughly familiar with hydrodynamics (of which I‚Äôm
sure few of you are) will recognize this as the equation of motion for
an electrically charged fluid if we identify¬†$\hbar\theta$ as the
‚Äúvelocity potential‚Äù‚Äîexcept that the last term, which should be
the energy of compression of the fluid, has a rather strange
dependence on the density¬†$\rho$. In any case, the equation says that
the rate of change of the quantity¬†$\hbar\theta$ is given by a kinetic
energy term, $-\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2$, plus a potential energy term,
$-q\phi$, with an additional term, containing the factor¬†$\hbar^2$,
which we could call a ‚Äúquantum mechanical energy.‚Äù We have seen that
inside a superconductor $\rho$¬†is kept very uniform by the
electrostatic forces, so this term can almost certainly be neglected
in every practical application provided we have only one
superconducting region. If we have a boundary between two
superconductors (or other circumstances in which the value of¬†$\rho$
may change rapidly) this term can become important.</p>

<div id="Ch21-S8-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">For those who are not so familiar with the equations of hydrodynamics,
I can rewrite Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2133">21.33</a>) in a form that makes the
physics more apparent by using Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2131">21.31</a>) to express
$\theta$ in terms of¬†$\FLPv$. Taking the gradient of the whole of
Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2133">21.33</a>) and expressing $\FLPgrad{\theta}$ in terms
of $\FLPA$ and¬†$\FLPv$ by using¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2131">21.31</a>), I get
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:34}
\ddp{\FLPv}{t}=\frac{q}{m}\biggl(-\FLPgrad{\phi}-\ddp{\FLPA}{t}\biggr)-
\FLPv\times(\FLPcurl{\FLPv})-(\FLPv\cdot\FLPnabla)\FLPv+
\FLPgrad{\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^2}
\biggl(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}\,\nabla^2\sqrt{\rho}\biggr)}.
\end{equation}
</span>
<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{align}
\ddp{\FLPv}{t}&=\frac{q}{m}\biggl(-\FLPgrad{\phi}-\ddp{\FLPA}{t}\biggr)

\label{Eq:III:21:34}
&-(\FLPv\cdot\FLPnabla)\FLPv +
\FLPgrad{\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^2}
\biggl(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}\,\nabla^2\sqrt{\rho}\biggr)}.
\end{align}
</span>
What does this equation mean? First, remember that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:35}
-\FLPgrad{\phi}-\ddp{\FLPA}{t}=\FLPE.
\end{equation}

Next, notice that if I take the curl of Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2131">21.31</a>), I
get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:36}
\FLPcurl{\FLPv}=-\frac{q}{m}\,\FLPcurl{\FLPA},
\end{equation}

since the curl of a gradient is always zero. But $\FLPcurl{\FLPA}$ is
the magnetic field¬†$\FLPB$, so the first two terms can be written as
\begin{equation*}
\frac{q}{m}(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB).
\end{equation*}

Finally, you should understand that $\ddpl{\FLPv}{t}$ stands for the
rate of change of the velocity of the fluid at a point. If you
concentrate on a particular particle, its acceleration is the
<em class="emph">total</em> derivative of¬†$\FLPv$ (or, as it is sometimes called in
fluid dynamics, the ‚Äúcomoving acceleration‚Äù), which is related
to¬†$\ddpl{\FLPv}{t}$ by<a name="footnote_source_18" href="#footnote_18"><sup class="mark">18</sup></a>
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:37}
\left.\ddt{\FLPv}{t}\right|_{\text{comoving}}\kern{-2ex}=
\ddp{\FLPv}{t}+(\FLPv\cdot\FLPnabla)\FLPv.
\end{equation}

This extra term also appears as the third term on the right side of
Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2134">21.34</a>). Taking it to the left side, I can write
Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2134">21.34</a>) in the following way:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:38}
\left.m\ddt{\FLPv}{t}\right|_{\text{comoving}}\kern{-3.5ex}=
q(\FLPE\!+\!\FLPv\!\times\!\FLPB)\!+\!\FLPgrad{\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^2}
\!\biggl(\!\frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}\nabla^2\!\!\sqrt{\rho}\!\biggr)}.
\end{equation}

We also have from Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2136">21.36</a>) that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:39}
\FLPcurl{\FLPv}=-\frac{q}{m}\,\FLPB.

<p class="p">These two equations are the equations of motion of the superconducting

which is the gradient of some mystical quantum mechanical
potential‚Äîa force which is not very big except at the junction
between two superconductors. The second equation says that the fluid
is ‚Äúideal‚Äù‚Äîthe curl of¬†$\FLPv$ has zero divergence (the divergence
of¬†$\FLPB$ is always zero). That means that the velocity can be
expressed in terms of velocity potential. Ordinarily one writes that
$\FLPcurl{\FLPv}=\FLPzero$ for an ideal fluid, but for an <em class="emph">ideal

you take these equations for the fluid [or the equivalent pair,
Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2132">21.32</a>) and¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2133">21.33</a>)], and combine

from the ordinary energy associated with variations of density. Just
as in an ordinary fluid there should be a potential energy density
proportional to the square of the deviation of¬†$\rho$ from¬†$\rho_0$,
the undisturbed density (which is, here, also equal to the charge
density of the crystal lattice). Since there will be forces
proportional to the gradient of this energy, there should be another
term in Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2138">21.38</a>) of the form:
$(\text{const})\,\FLPgrad{(\rho-\rho_0)^2}$. This term did not appear
from the analysis because it comes from the interactions between
particles, which I neglected in using an independent-particle
approximation. It is, however, just the force I referred to when I
made the qualitative statement that electrostatic forces would tend to
keep¬†$\rho$ nearly constant inside a superconductor.</p>

Josephson<a name="footnote_source_19" href="#footnote_19"><sup class="mark">19</sup></a> while analyzing what might happen at

‚ÄúJosephson junction.‚Äù If the insulating layer is thick, the

$\psi_1$ is the common wave function of all the electrons on one side,
and $\psi_2$ is the corresponding function on the other side. I could
do this problem for different kinds of superconductors, but let us
take a very simple situation in which the material is the same on both
sides so that the junction is symmetrical and simple. Also, for a
moment let there be no magnetic field. Then the two amplitudes should
be related in the following way:

leakage from one side to the other. (It is just the ‚Äúflip-flop‚Äù

(compared to ordinary voltage and times), the sine oscillates rather
rapidly and the net current is nothing. (In practice, since the
temperature is not zero, you would get a small current due to the
conduction by ‚Äúnormal‚Äù electrons.) On the other hand if you have
<em class="emph">zero</em> voltage across the junction, you can get a current! With no

it and the current goes to zero. This strange behavior has recently been

the interference between amplitudes from two different slits. Now we‚Äôre
going to do the interference between two junctions caused by the
difference in the phase of the arrival of the currents through two
different paths. In Fig.¬†<a href="#Ch21-F7">21‚Äì7</a>, I show two different
junctions, ‚Äúa‚Äù and ‚Äúb‚Äù, connected in parallel. The ends, $P$

their phases be $\delta_{\text{a}}$ and¬†$\delta_{\text{b}}$. Now the

Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2126">21.26</a>). If you integrate that equation along some
path, the left-hand side gives the phase change, which is then just
proportional to the line integral of¬†$\FLPA$, as we have written here.
The phase change along the lower route can be written similarly
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:50}
\Delta\text{Phase}_{P\to Q}=\delta_{\text{b}}+
\frac{2q_e}{\hbar}\int_{\text{lower}}\kern{-3ex}\FLPA\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation}

These two must be equal; and if I subtract them I get that the
difference of the deltas must be the line integral of¬†$\FLPA$ around
the circuit:
\begin{equation*}
\delta_{\text{b}}-\delta_{\text{a}}=
\frac{2q_e}{\hbar}\oint_\Gamma\FLPA\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation*}

Here the integral is around the closed loop¬†$\Gamma$ of Fig.¬†<a href="#Ch21-F7">21‚Äì7</a>
which circles through both junctions. The integral over¬†$\FLPA$ is the
magnetic flux¬†$\Phi$ through the loop. So the two¬†$\delta$‚Äôs are going
to differ by $2q_e/\hbar$¬†times the magnetic flux¬†$\Phi$ which passes
between the two branches of the circuit:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:21:51}
\delta_{\text{b}}-\delta_{\text{a}}=\frac{2q_e}{\hbar}\,\Phi.
\end{equation}

I can control this phase difference by changing the magnetic field on
the circuit, so I can adjust the differences in phases and see whether
or not the total current that flows through the two junctions shows
any interference of the two parts. The total current will be the sum
of $J_{\text{a}}$ and¬†$J_{\text{b}}$. For convenience, I will write
\begin{equation*}
\delta_{\text{a}}=\delta_0-\frac{q_e}{\hbar}\,\Phi,\quad
\delta_{\text{b}}=\delta_0+\frac{q_e}{\hbar}\,\Phi.
\end{equation*}
Then,
\begin{align}
J_{\text{total}} &=J_0\biggl\{\!\sin\biggl(\!
\delta_0\!-\!\frac{q_e}{\hbar}\Phi\!\biggr)\!+\sin\biggl(\!
\delta_0\!+\!\frac{q_e}{\hbar}\,\Phi\!\biggr)\!\biggr\}\notag\\[1.5ex]
\label{Eq:III:21:52}
 &=2J_0\sin\delta_0\cos\frac{q_e\Phi}{\hbar}.
\end{align}

<div id="Ch21-S9-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we don‚Äôt know anything about¬†$\delta_0$, and nature can adjust
that anyway she wants depending on the circumstances. In particular,
it will depend on the external voltage we apply to the junction. No
matter what we do, however, $\sin\delta_0$ can never get bigger
than¬†$1$. So the <em class="emph">maximum</em> current for any given¬†$\Phi$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
J_{\text{max}}=2J_0\left\lvert
\cos\frac{q_e}{\hbar}\,\Phi\right\rvert.
\end{equation*}

This maximum current will vary with¬†$\Phi$ and will itself have maxima
whenever
\begin{equation*}
\Phi=n\,\frac{\pi\hbar}{q_e},
\end{equation*}

with $n$¬†some integer. That is to say that the current takes on its
maximum values where the flux linkage has just those quantized values
we found in Eq.¬†(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII2130">21.30</a>)!</p>

<p class="p">One of the intriguing questions about quantum mechanics is the question
of whether the vector potential exists in a place where there‚Äôs no
field.<a name="footnote_source_23" href="#footnote_23"><sup class="mark">23</sup></a> This
experiment I have just described has also been done with a tiny solenoid
between the two junctions so that the only significant magnetic
$\FLPB$¬†field is inside the solenoid and a negligible amount is on the
superconducting wires themselves. Yet it is reported that the amount of
current depends oscillatorily on the flux of magnetic field inside that

<p class="p">I don‚Äôt know what will come next. But look what can be done. First,
notice that the interference between two junctions can be used to make
a sensitive magnetometer. If a pair of junctions is made with an
enclosed area of, say, $1$¬†mm$^2$, the maxima in the curve of
Fig.¬†<a href="#Ch21-F8">21‚Äì8</a> would be separated by $2\times10^{-6}$¬†gauss. It
is certainly possible to tell when you are $1/10$¬†of the way between two
peaks; so it should be possible to use such a junction to measure
magnetic fields as small as $2\times10^{-7}$¬†gauss‚Äîor to measure
larger fields to such a precision. One should be able to go even
further. Suppose for example we put a set of $10$ or $20$¬†junctions
close together and equally spaced. Then we can have the interference
between $10$ or $20$¬†slits and as we change the magnetic field we will
get very sharp maxima and minima. Instead of a $2$-slit interference we
can have a $20$- or perhaps even a $100$-slit interferometer for
measuring the magnetic field. Perhaps we can predict that the
measurement of magnetic fields will‚Äîby using the effects of
quantum-mechanical interference‚Äîeventually become almost as precise as
the measurement of wavelength of light.</p>

<p class="p">These then are some illustrations of things that are happening in
modern times‚Äîthe transistor, the laser, and now these junctions,
whose ultimate practical applications are still not known. The quantum
mechanics which was discovered in 1926 has had nearly 40 years of
development, and rather suddenly it has begun to be exploited in many
practical and real ways. We are really getting control of nature on a
very delicate and beautiful level.</p>

  Actually if the electric field were too strong, pairs
would be broken up and the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù electrons created would move in
to help neutralize any excess of positive charge. Still, it takes
energy to make these normal electrons, so the main point is that a
nearly uniform density¬†$\rho$ is highly favored energetically.
