<span class="tag">8–1</span>The electrostatic energy of charges. A uniform sphere</h3>
<div id="Ch8-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In the study of mechanics, one of the most interesting and useful
discoveries was the law of the conservation of energy. The expressions
for the kinetic and potential energies of a mechanical system helped
us to discover connections between the states of a system at two
different times without having to look into the details of what was
occurring in between. We wish now to consider the energy of
electrostatic systems. In electricity also the principle of the
conservation of energy will be useful for discovering a number of
interesting things.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch8-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">The law of the energy of interaction in electrostatics is very simple;
we have, in fact, already discussed it. Suppose we have two charges
$q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by the distance $r_{12}$. There is some
energy in the system, because a certain amount of work was required to
bring the charges together. We have already calculated the work done
in bringing two charges together from a large distance. It is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:1}
\frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\epsO r_{12}}.
\end{equation}

We also know, from the principle of superposition, that if we have
many charges present, the total force on any charge is the sum of the
forces from the others. It follows, therefore, that the total energy
of a system of a number of charges is the sum of terms due to the
mutual interaction of each pair of charges. If $q_i$ and $q_j$ are any
two of the charges and $r_{ij}$ is the distance between them
(Fig. <a href="#Ch8-F1">8–1</a>), the energy of that particular pair is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:2}
\frac{q_iq_j}{4\pi\epsO r_{ij}}.
\end{equation}

The total electrostatic energy $U$ is the sum of the energies of all
possible pairs of charges:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:3}
U=\underset{\text{all pairs}}{\sum}
\frac{q_iq_j}{4\pi\epsO r_{ij}}.
\end{equation}

If we have a distribution of charge specified by a charge
density $\rho$, the sum of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII83">8.3</a>) is, of course, to be
replaced by an integral.</p>

<div id="Ch8-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We shall concern ourselves with two aspects of this energy. One is the
<em class="emph">application</em> of the concept of energy to electrostatic problems;
the other is the <em class="emph">evaluation</em> of the energy in different
ways. Sometimes it is easier to compute the work done for some special
case than to evaluate the sum in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII83">8.3</a>), or the
corresponding integral. As an example, let us calculate the energy
required to assemble a sphere of charge with a uniform charge
density. The energy is just the work done in gathering the charges
together from infinity.</p>

imagining that it is assembled from successive spherical shells.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch8-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Imagine that we assemble the sphere by building up a succession of
thin spherical layers of infinitesimal thickness. At each stage of the
process, we gather a small amount of charge and put it in a thin layer
from $r$ to $r+dr$. We continue the process until we arrive at the
final radius $a$ (Fig. <a href="#Ch8-F2">8–2</a>). If $Q_r$ is the charge of
the sphere when it has been built up to the radius $r$, the work done
in bringing a charge $dQ$ to it is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:4}
dU=\frac{Q_r\,dQ}{4\pi\epsO r}.
\end{equation}

If the density of charge in the sphere is $\rho$, the charge $Q_r$ is
\begin{equation}
Q_r=\rho\cdot\frac{4}{3}\,\pi r^3,\notag
\end{equation}

and the charge $dQ$ is
\begin{equation}
dQ=\rho\cdot4\pi r^2\,dr.\notag
\end{equation}

Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII84">8.4</a>) becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:5}
dU=\frac{4\pi\rho^2r^4\,dr}{3\epsO}.
\end{equation}

The total energy required to assemble the sphere is the integral of $dU$
from $r=0$ to $r=a$, or
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:6}
U=\frac{4\pi\rho^2a^5}{15\epsO}.
\end{equation}

Or if we wish to express the result in terms of the total charge $Q$
of the sphere,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:7}
U=\frac{3}{5}\,\frac{Q^2}{4\pi\epsO a}.
\end{equation}

The energy is proportional to the square of the total charge and
inversely proportional to the radius.
We can also interpret Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII87">8.7</a>) as saying that the average
of $(1/r_{ij})$ for all pairs of points in the sphere is $6/5a$.</p>

<span class="tag">8–2</span>The energy of a condenser. Forces on charged conductors</h3>
<div id="Ch8-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We consider now the energy required to charge a condenser. If the
charge $Q$ has been taken from one of the conductors of a condenser
and placed on the other, the potential difference between them is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:8}
V=\frac{Q}{C},
\end{equation}

where $C$ is the capacity of the
condenser.
How much work is done in charging the condenser?
Proceeding as for the sphere, we imagine that the condenser has been
charged by transferring charge from one plate to the other in small
increments $dQ$. The work required to transfer the charge $dQ$ is
\begin{equation*}
dU=VdQ.
\end{equation*}

Taking $V$ from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII88">8.8</a>), we write
\begin{equation*}
dU=\frac{Q\,dQ}{C}.
\end{equation*}

Or integrating from zero charge to the final charge $Q$, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:9}
U=\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{Q^2}{C}.
\end{equation}

This energy can also be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:10}
U=\tfrac{1}{2}CV^2.
\end{equation}

Recalling that the capacity of a conducting sphere (relative to
infinity) is
\begin{equation*}
C_{\text{sphere}}=4\pi\epsO a,
\end{equation*}

we can immediately get from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII89">8.9</a>) the energy of a
charged sphere,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:11}
U=\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{Q^2}{4\pi\epsO a}.
\end{equation}

This, of course, is also the energy of a thin <em class="emph">spherical shell</em>
of total charge $Q$ and is just $5/6$ of the energy of a
<em class="emph">uniformly charged</em> sphere, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII87">8.7</a>).</p>

<div id="Ch8-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We now consider applications of the idea of electrostatic
energy. Consider the following questions: What is the force between
the plates of a condenser? Or what is the torque about some axis of a
charged conductor in the presence of another with opposite charge?
Such questions are easily answered by using our result
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII89">8.9</a>) for electrostatic energy of a condenser, together
with the principle of virtual work (Chapters
<a href="I_04.html">4</a>, <a href="I_13.html">13</a>, and <a href="I_14.html">14</a> of Vol. I).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch8-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s use this method for determining the force between the plates of a
parallel-plate condenser. If we imagine that the spacing of the plates is
increased by the small amount $\Delta z$, then the mechanical work done
from the outside in moving the plates would be
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:12}
\Delta W=F\,\Delta z,
\end{equation}

where $F$ is the force between the plates. This work must be equal to
the change in the electrostatic energy of the condenser.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch8-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">By Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII89">8.9</a>), the energy of the condenser was originally
\begin{equation*}
U=\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{Q^2}{C}.
\end{equation*}

The change in energy (if we do not let the charge change) is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:13}
\Delta U=\frac{1}{2}\,Q^2\,\Delta\biggl(\frac{1}{C}\biggr).
\end{equation}

Equating (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII812">8.12</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII813">8.13</a>), we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:14}
F\,\Delta z=\frac{Q^2}{2}\,\Delta\biggl(\frac{1}{C}\biggr).
\end{equation}

This can also be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:15}
F\,\Delta z=-\frac{Q^2}{2C^2}\,\Delta C.
\end{equation}

The force, of course, results from the attraction of the charges on
the plates, but we see that we do not have to worry in detail about
how they are distributed; everything we need is taken care of in the
capacity $C$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch8-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">It is easy to see how the idea is extended to conductors of any shape,
and for other components of the force. In Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII814">8.14</a>), we
replace $F$ by the component we are looking for, and we
replace $\Delta z$ by a small displacement in the corresponding direction. Or
if we have an electrode with a pivot and we want to know the
torque $\tau$, we write the virtual work as
\begin{equation*}
\Delta W=\tau\,\Delta\theta,
\end{equation*}

where $\Delta\theta$ is a small angular displacement. Of course,
$\Delta(1/ C)$ must be the change in $1/C$ which corresponds
to $\Delta\theta$. We could, in this way, find the torque on the movable
plates in a variable condenser of the type shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch8-F3">8–3</a>.</p>

<div id="Ch8-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Returning to the special case of a parallel-plate condenser, we can
use the formula we derived in Chapter <a href="II_06.html">6</a> for the
capacity:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:16}
\frac{1}{C}=\frac{d}{\epsO A},
\end{equation}

where $A$ is the area of each plate. If we increase the separation
by $\Delta z$,
\begin{equation*}
\Delta\biggl(\frac{1}{C}\biggr)=\frac{\Delta z}{\epsO A}.
\end{equation*}

From Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII814">8.14</a>) we get that the force between the plates
is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:17}
F=\frac{Q^2}{2\epsO A}.

</div>
<div id="Ch8-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s look at Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII817">8.17</a>) a little more closely and see
if we can tell how the force arises. If for the charge on one plate we
write
\begin{equation*}
Q=\sigma A,
\end{equation*}

Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII817">8.17</a>) can be rewritten as
\begin{equation*}
F=\frac{1}{2}\,Q\,\frac{\sigma}{\epsO}.
\end{equation*}

Or, since the electric field between the plates is
\begin{equation}
E_0=\frac{\sigma}{\epsO},\notag

then
\begin{equation}

<div id="Ch8-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">One would immediately guess that the force acting on one plate is the
charge $Q$ on the plate times the field acting on the charge. But we
have a surprising factor of one-half. The reason is that $E_0$ is not
the field <em class="emph">at</em> the charges. If we imagine that the charge at the
surface of the plate occupies a thin layer, as indicated in
Fig. <a href="#Ch8-F4">8–4</a>, the field will vary from zero at the inner
boundary of the layer to $E_0$ in the space outside of the plate. The
average field acting on the surface charges is $E_0/2$. That is why the

Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII815">8.15</a>) (because $V=Q/C$), but with the opposite sign!
Surely the force between the condenser plates doesn’t reverse in sign as
we disconnect it from its charging source. Also, we know that two plates
with opposite electrical charges must attract. The principle of virtual
work has been incorrectly applied in the second case—we have not taken
into account the virtual work done on the charging source. That is, to
keep the potential constant at $V$ as the capacity changes, a charge
$V\,\Delta C$ must be supplied by a source of charge. But this charge is
supplied at a potential $V$, so the work done by the electrical system
which keeps the potential constant is $V^2\,\Delta C$. The mechanical
work $F\,\Delta z$ <em class="emph">plus</em> this electrical work $V^2\,\Delta C$

<div id="Ch8-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We now consider an application of the concept of electrostatic energy
in atomic physics. We cannot easily measure the forces between atoms,
but we are often interested in the energy differences between one
atomic arrangement and another, as, for example, the energy of a
chemical change. Since atomic forces are basically electrical,
chemical energies are in large part just electrostatic energies.</p>

<p class="p">Let’s consider, for example, the electrostatic energy of an ionic

together.</p>

pull all these ions apart—that is, to separate the crystal
completely into ions? This energy should be equal to the heat of
vaporization of NaCl plus the energy required to dissociate the
molecules into ions. This total energy to separate NaCl to ions is
determined experimentally to be $7.92$ electron volts per
molecule. Using the conversion
\begin{equation*}
1\text{ eV}=1.602\times10^{-19}\text{ joule},
\end{equation*}

and Avogadro’s number for the number of molecules in a mole,
\begin{equation*}
N_0=6.02\times10^{23},

the energy of dissociation can also be given as
\begin{equation*}
W=7.64\times10^5\text{ joules/mole}.

Physical chemists prefer for an energy unit the
kilocalorie, which is $4190$ joules; so that
$1$ eV per molecule is $23$ kilocalories per mole. A chemist would then
say that the dissociation energy of NaCl is

work it would take to pull apart the crystal? According to our theory,
this work is the sum of the potential energies of all the pairs of

ions. That will give us <em class="emph">twice</em> the energy per ion, because the
energy belongs to the <em class="emph">pairs</em> of charges. If we want the energy
to be associated with one particular ion, we should take half the sum.
But we really want the energy <em class="emph">per molecule</em>, which contains two
ions, so that the sum we compute will give directly the energy per

$5.12$ eV, which we already see is going to give us a result of the
correct order of magnitude. But it is still a long way from the
infinite sum of terms we need.</p>

<div id="Ch8-S3-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s begin by summing all the terms from the ions along a straight
line.  Considering that the ion marked Na in Fig. <a href="#Ch8-F5">8–5</a>

line with it. There are two nearest Cl ions with negative charges,
each at the distance $a$. Then there are two positive ions at the
distance $2a$, etc. Calling the energy of this sum $U_1$, we write
\begin{align}
U_1&=\frac{e^2}{a}\biggl(

Our answer is about $10\%$ above the experimentally observed
energy. It shows that our idea that the whole lattice is held together

first time that we have obtained a specific property of a macroscopic
substance from a knowledge of atomic physics. We will do much more

<div id="Ch8-S3-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Now what about the error in our calculation? Why is it not exactly
right? It is because of the repulsion between the ions at close
distances. They are not perfectly rigid spheres, so when they are
close together they are partly squashed. They are not very soft, so
they squash only a little bit. Some energy, however, is used in
deforming them, and when the ions are pulled apart this energy is
released.  The actual energy needed to pull the ions apart is a little
less than the energy that we calculated; the repulsion helps in
overcoming the electrostatic attraction.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch8-S3-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">Is there any way we can make an allowance for this contribution? We
could if we knew the law of the repulsive force. We are not ready to
analyze the details of this repulsive mechanism, but we can get some
idea of its characteristics from some large-scale measurements. From a
measurement of the <em class="emph">compressibility</em> of the whole crystal, it is
possible to obtain a quantitative idea of the law of repulsion between
the ions and therefore of its contribution to the energy. In this way
it has been found that this contribution must be $1/9.4$ of the
contribution from the electrostatic attraction and, of course, of
opposite sign. If we subtract this contribution from the pure
electrostatic energy, we obtain $7.99$ eV for the dissociation energy
per molecule. It is much closer to the observed result of $7.92$ eV,
but still not in perfect agreement. There is one more thing we haven’t
taken into account: we have made no allowance for the kinetic energy
of the crystal vibrations. If a correction is made for this effect,
very good agreement with the experimental number is obtained. The
ideas are then correct; the major contribution to the energy of a
crystal like NaCl is electrostatic.</p>

discovery of nuclei—and of the neutrons and protons that make them
up—it was hoped that the law of the strong, nonelectrical part of the
force between, say, a proton and another proton would have some simple
law, like the inverse square law of electricity. For once one had
determined this law of force, and the corresponding ones between a
proton and a neutron, and a neutron and a neutron, it would be possible
to describe theoretically the complete behavior of these particles in
nuclei. Therefore a big program was started for the study of the
scattering of protons, in the hope of finding the law of force between

eleven particles interact with one another in a most complicated
dance. Now, there is one configuration of all the possible
interactions which has the lowest possible energy; this is the normal
state of the nucleus, and is called the <em class="emph">ground state</em>. If the nucleus is disturbed (for example, by being struck by a
high-energy proton or other particle) it can be put into any number of
other configurations, called <em class="emph">excited states</em>, each of which will have a
characteristic energy that is higher than that of the ground state. In
nuclear physics research, such as is carried on with Van de
Graaff generator (for example, in
Caltech’s Kellogg and Sloan Laboratories), the energies and other

explanation for this rather complicated pattern of energies; there is as
yet, however, no complete general theory of such nuclear energy levels.

little change. This can mean only that the neutron-neutron and

$1.982$ MeV. All the other levels are also higher in absolute energy
by this same amount. So the forces are not exactly equal. But we know
very well that the <em class="emph">complete</em> forces are not exactly equal; there
is an <em class="emph">electrical</em> force between two protons because each has a
positive charge, while between two neutrons there is no such
electrical force. Can we perhaps explain the differences between
B$^{11}$ and C$^{11}$ by the fact that the electrical interaction of
the protons is different in the two cases?  Perhaps even the remaining
minor differences in the levels are caused by electrical effects?
Since the nuclear forces are so much stronger than the electrical

the energies of the levels.</p>

<p class="p">In order to check this idea, or rather to find out what the
consequences of this idea are, we first consider the difference in the
ground-state energies of the two nuclei. To take a very simple model,
we suppose that the nuclei are spheres of radius $r$ (to be
determined), containing $Z$ protons. If we consider that a nucleus is
like a sphere with uniform charge density, we would expect the
electrostatic energy (from Eq. <a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII87">8.7</a>) to be
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:22}
U=\frac{3}{5}\,\frac{(Zq_e)^2}{4\pi\epsO r}.

be different.</p>

<p class="p">With such a small number of protons, however, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII822">8.22</a>)
is not quite correct. If we compute the electrical energy between all

uniformly distributed throughout the sphere, we find that in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII822">8.22</a>) the quantity $Z^2$ should be replaced

find the electrostatic energy difference between B$^{11}$ and
C$^{11}$. But let’s do the opposite; let’s instead use the observed

rest energies—that is, the energy $mc^2$—of all the particles. In
going from B$^{11}$ to C$^{11}$, we replace a neutron by a proton and
an electron, which have less mass. So part of the energy difference is
the difference in the rest energies of a neutron and that of a proton
plus an electron, which is $0.784$ MeV. The difference, to be
accounted for by electrostatic energy, is thus more than $1.982$ MeV;

the current understanding of nuclei, an even number of nuclear

to this core, it revolves around on the outside to make a new
spherical nucleus, rather than being absorbed. If this is so, we
should have taken a different electrostatic energy for the additional
proton. We should have taken the excess energy of C$^{11}$ over
B$^{11}$ to be just
\begin{equation*}
\frac{Z_Bq_e^2}{4\pi\epsO r}

which is the energy needed to add one more proton to the outside of
the core. This number is just $5/6$ of what Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII823">8.23</a>)

<p class="p">We now consider other methods of calculating electrostatic
energy. They can all be derived from the basic relation
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII83">8.3</a>), the sum, over all pairs of charges, of the mutual
energies of each charge-pair. First we wish to write an expression for
the energy of a charge distribution. As usual, we consider that each
volume element $dV$ contains the element of charge $\rho\,dV$. Then
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII83">8.3</a>) should be written
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:27}
U=\frac{1}{2}\underset{\substack{\text{all}\\\text{space}}}{\int}
\frac{\rho(1)\rho(2)}{4\pi\epsO r_{12}}\,dV_1dV_2.
\end{equation}

Notice the factor $\tfrac{1}{2}$, which is introduced because in the
double integral over $dV_1$ and $dV_2$ we have counted all pairs of
charge elements twice. (There is no convenient way of writing an
integral that keeps track of the pairs so that each pair is counted
only once.)  Next we notice that the integral over $dV_2$
in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII827">8.27</a>) is just the potential at $(1)$. That is,
\begin{equation*}
\int\frac{\rho(2)}{4\pi\epsO r_{12}}\,dV_2=\phi(1),
\end{equation*}

so that (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII827">8.27</a>) can be written as
\begin{equation*}
U=\frac{1}{2}\int\rho(1)\phi(1)\,dV_1.
\end{equation*}

Or, since the point $(2)$ no longer appears, we can simply write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:28}
U=\frac{1}{2}\int\rho\phi\,dV.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch8-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">This equation can be interpreted as follows. The potential energy of
the charge $\rho\,dV$ is the product of this charge and the potential
at the same point. The total energy is therefore the integral
over $\phi\rho\,dV$. But there is again the factor $\tfrac{1}{2}$. It is
still required because we are counting energies twice. The mutual
energies of two charges is the charge of one times the potential at it
due to the other. <em class="emph">Or</em>, it can be taken as the second charge
times the potential at it from the first. Thus for two point charges
we would write
\begin{equation*}
 U=q_1\phi(1)=q_1\,\frac{q_2}{4\pi\epsO r_{12}}
\end{equation*}

<em class="emph">or</em>
\begin{equation*}
 U=q_2\phi(2)=q_2\,\frac{q_1}{4\pi\epsO r_{12}}.

Notice that we could also write
\begin{equation}

U=\tfrac{1}{2}[q_1\phi(1)+q_2\phi(2)].

The integral in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII828">8.28</a>) corresponds to the sum of both

<div id="Ch8-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">An interesting question is: Where is the electrostatic energy located?
One might also ask: Who cares? What is the meaning of such a question?
If there is a pair of interacting charges, the combination has a
certain energy. Do we need to say that the energy is located at one of
the charges or the other, or at both, or in between? These questions
may not make sense because we really know only that the total energy
is conserved. The idea that the energy is located <em class="emph">somewhere</em> is
not necessary.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch8-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Yet suppose that it <em class="emph">did</em> make sense to say, in general, that
energy is located at a certain place, as it does for heat energy. We
might then <em class="emph">extend</em> our principle of the conservation of energy
with the idea that if the energy in a given volume changes, we should
be able to account for the change by the flow of energy into or out of
that volume. You realize that our early statement of the principle of
the conservation of energy is still perfectly all right if some energy
disappears at one place and appears somewhere else far away without
anything passing (that is, without any special phenomena occurring) in
the space between. We are, therefore, now discussing an extension of
the idea of the conservation of energy. We might call it a principle
of the <em class="emph">local</em> conservation of energy. Such a principle would say
that the energy in any given volume changes only by the amount that
flows into or out of the volume. It is indeed possible that energy is
conserved locally in such a way. If it is, we would have a much more
detailed law than the simple statement of the conservation of total
energy. It does turn out that in nature <em class="emph">energy is conserved
locally</em>. We can find formulas for where the energy is located and how
it travels from place to place.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch8-S5-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">There is also a <em class="emph">physical</em> reason why it is imperative that we be
able to say where energy is located. According to the theory of
gravitation, all mass is a source of gravitational attraction. We also
know, by $E=mc^2$, that mass and energy are equivalent. All energy is,
therefore, a source of gravitational force. If we could not locate the
energy, we could not locate all the mass. We would not be able to say
where the sources of the gravitational field are located. The theory
of gravitation would be incomplete.</p>

<div id="Ch8-S5-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">If we restrict ourselves to electrostatics there is really no way to
tell where the energy is located. The complete Maxwell
equations
of electrodynamics give us much more information (although even then the
answer is, strictly speaking, not unique.) We will therefore discuss
this question in detail again in a later chapter.  We will give you now
only the result for the particular case of electrostatics.  The energy
is located in space, where the electric field is. This seems reasonable
because we know that when charges are accelerated they radiate electric
fields.  We would like to say that when light or radiowaves travel from
one point to another, they carry their energy with them. But there are
no charges in the waves. So we would like to locate the energy where the
electromagnetic field is and not at the charges from which it came. We
thus describe the energy, not in terms of the charges, but in terms of
the fields they produce. We can, in fact, show that
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII828">8.28</a>) is <em class="emph">numerically</em> equal to
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:30}
U=\frac{\epsO}{2}\int\FLPE\cdot\FLPE\,dV.

We can then interpret this formula as saying that when an electric

infinity (so the volume integrals become integrals over all space),
supposing that all the charges are located within some finite

enormous radius $R$ whose center is at the origin of coordinates. We
know that when we are very far away from all charges, $\phi$ varies
as $1/R$ and $\FLPgrad{\phi}$ as $1/R^2$. (Both will decrease even faster

the surface area of the large sphere increases as $R^2$, we see that
the surface integral falls off as $(1/R)(1/R^2)R^2=(1/R)$ as the

integration ($R\to\infty$), the surface integral goes to zero and we
have that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:35}
U=\frac{\epsO}{2}
\underset{\substack{\text{all}\\\text{space}}}{\int}
(\FLPgrad{\phi})\cdot(\FLPgrad{\phi})\,dV=
\frac{\epsO}{2}
\underset{\substack{\text{all}\\\text{space}}}{\int}
\FLPE\cdot\FLPE\,dV.
\end{equation}

We see that it is possible for us to represent the energy of any
charge distribution as being the integral over an energy density
located in the field.</p>

<span class="tag">8–6</span>The energy of a point charge</h3>
<div id="Ch8-S6-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Our new relation, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII835">8.35</a>), says that even a single
point charge $q$ will have some electrostatic energy. In this case,
the electric field is given by
\begin{equation*}
E=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsO r^2}.
\end{equation*}

So the energy density at the distance $r$ from the charge is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\epsO E^2}{2}=\frac{q^2}{32\pi^2\epsO r^4}.
\end{equation*}

We can take for an element of volume a spherical shell of thickness $dr$
and area $4\pi r^2$. The total energy is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:8:36}
U=\int\limits_{r=0}^\infty\frac{q^2}{8\pi\epsO r^2}\,dr=
\left.-\frac{q^2}{8\pi\epsO}\,\frac{1}{r}\right|_{r=0}^{r=\infty}.
\end{equation}

<div id="Ch8-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now the limit at $r=\infty$ gives no difficulty. But for a point
charge we are supposed to integrate down to $r=0$, which gives an
infinite integral. Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII835">8.35</a>) says that there is an
infinite amount of energy in the field of a point charge, although we
began with the idea that there was energy only <em class="emph">between</em> point
charges.  In our original energy formula for a collection of point
charges (Eq. <a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII83">8.3</a>), we did not include any interaction
energy of a charge with itself. What has happened is that when we went
over to a continuous distribution of charge in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII827">8.27</a>),
we counted the energy of interaction of every <em class="emph">infinitesimal</em>
charge with all other infinitesimal charges. The same account is
included in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII835">8.35</a>), so when we apply it to a
<em class="emph">finite</em> point charge, we are including the energy it would take to
assemble that charge from infinitesimal parts. You will notice, in fact,
that we would also get the result in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII836">8.36</a>) if we used
our expression (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII811">8.11</a>) for the energy of a charged sphere and
let the radius tend toward zero.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch8-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We must conclude that the idea of locating the energy in the field is
inconsistent with the assumption of the existence of point
charges. One way out of the difficulty would be to say that elementary
charges, such as an electron, are not points but are really small
distributions of charge. Alternatively, we could say that there is
something wrong in our theory of electricity at very small distances,
or with the idea of the local conservation of energy. There are
difficulties with either point of view. These difficulties have never
been overcome; they exist to this day. Sometime later, when we have
discussed some additional ideas, such as the momentum in an
electromagnetic field, we will give a more complete account of these
fundamental difficulties in our understanding of nature.</p>
