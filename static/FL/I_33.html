<div id="Ch33-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In this chapter we shall consider those phenomena which depend on the
fact that the electric field that describes the light is a vector. In
previous chapters we have not been concerned with the direction of
oscillation of the electric field, except to note that the electric
vector lies in a plane perpendicular to the direction of
propagation. The particular direction in this plane has not concerned
us. We now consider those phenomena whose central feature is the
particular direction of oscillation of the electric field.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">In ideally monochromatic light, the electric field must oscillate at a
definite frequency, but since the $x$-component and the $y$-component
can oscillate independently at a definite frequency, we must first
consider the resultant effect produced by superposing two independent
oscillations at right angles to each other. What kind of electric
field is made up of an $x$-component and a $y$-component which
oscillate at the same frequency? If one adds to an $x$-vibration a
certain amount of $y$-vibration at the same phase, the result is a
vibration in a new direction in the $xy$-plane. Figure <a href="#Ch33-F1">33–1</a>
illustrates the superposition of different amplitudes for the
$x$-vibration and the $y$-vibration. But the resultants shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F1">33–1</a> are not the only possibilities; in all of these
cases we have assumed that the $x$-vibration and the $y$-vibration are
<em class="emph">in phase</em>, but it does not have to be that way. It could be that
the $x$-vibration and the $y$-vibration are out of phase.</p>

<p class="p">When the $x$-vibration and the $y$-vibration are not in phase, the
electric field vector moves around in an ellipse, and we can
illustrate this in a familiar way. If we hang a ball from a support by
a long string, so that it can swing freely in a horizontal plane, it
will execute sinusoidal oscillations. If we imagine horizontal $x$-
and $y$-coordinates with their origin at the rest position of the
ball, the ball can swing in either the $x$- or $y$-direction with the
same pendulum frequency. By selecting the proper initial displacement
and initial velocity, we can set the ball in oscillation along either
the $x$-axis or the $y$-axis, or along any straight line in the
$xy$-plane. These motions of the ball are analogous to the
oscillations of the electric field vector illustrated in
Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F1">33–1</a>. In each instance, since the $x$-vibrations and
the $y$-vibrations reach their maxima and minima at the same time, the
$x$- and $y$-oscillations are in phase. But we know that the most
general motion of the ball is motion in an ellipse, which corresponds to
oscillations in which the $x$- and $y$-directions are <em class="emph">not</em> in the
same phase. The superposition of $x$- and $y$-vibrations which are not
in phase is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F2">33–2</a> for a variety of
angles between the phase of the $x$-vibration and that of the
$y$-vibration. The general result is that the electric vector moves
around an ellipse. The motion in a straight line is a particular case
corresponding to a phase difference of zero (or an integral multiple
of $\pi$); motion in a circle corresponds to equal amplitudes with a phase
difference of $90^\circ$ (or any odd integral multiple of $\pi/2$).</p>

<div id="Ch33-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now for some terminology. Light is <em class="emph">linearly polarized</em>
(sometimes called plane polarized) when the electric field oscillates
on a straight line; Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F1">33–1</a> illustrates linear
polarization. When the end of the electric field vector travels in an
ellipse, the light is <em class="emph">elliptically polarized</em>. When the end of
the electric field vector travels around a circle, we have
<em class="emph">circular polarization</em>. If the end of the
electric vector, when we look at it as the light comes straight toward
us, goes around in a counterclockwise direction, we call it right-hand
circular polarization. Figure <a href="#Ch33-F2">33–2</a>(g) illustrates right-hand
circular polarization, and Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F2">33–2</a>(c) shows left-hand
circular polarization. In both cases the light is coming out of the
paper. Our convention for labeling left-hand and right-hand circular
polarization is consistent with that which is used today for all the
other particles in physics which exhibit polarization (e.g., electrons).
However, in some books on optics the opposite conventions are used, so
one must be careful.</p>

<div id="Ch33-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">We have considered linearly, circularly, and elliptically polarized
light, which covers everything except for the case of
<em class="emph">unpolarized</em> light. Now how can the light be unpolarized when we
know that it must vibrate in one or another of these ellipses? If the
light is not absolutely monochromatic, or if the $x$- and $y$-phases
are not kept perfectly together, so that the electric vector first
vibrates in one direction, then in another, the polarization is
constantly changing. Remember that one atom emits during
$10^{-8}$ sec, and if one atom emits a certain polarization, and then another
atom emits light with a different polarization, the polarizations will
change every $10^{-8}$ sec. If the polarization changes more rapidly
than we can detect it, then we call the light unpolarized, because all
the effects of the polarization average out. None of the interference
effects of polarization would show up with unpolarized light. But as
we see from the definition, light is unpolarized only if we are unable
to find out whether the light is polarized or not.</p>

<span class="tag">33–2</span>Polarization of scattered light</h3>
<div id="Ch33-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">The first example of the polarization effect that we have already
discussed is the scattering of light. Consider a beam of light, for
example from the sun, shining on the air. The electric field will
produce oscillations of charges in the air, and motion of these
charges will radiate light with its maximum intensity in a plane
normal to the direction of vibration of the charges. The beam from the
sun is unpolarized, so the direction of polarization changes
constantly, and the direction of vibration of the charges in the air
changes constantly. If we consider light scattered at $90^\circ$, the
vibration of the charged particles radiates to the observer only when
the vibration is perpendicular to the observer’s line of sight, and
then light will be polarized along the direction of vibration. So
scattering is an example of one means of producing polarization.</p>

<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">33–3</span>Birefringence</h3>
<div id="Ch33-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Another interesting effect of polarization is the fact that there are
substances for which the index of refraction is different for light
linearly polarized in one direction and linearly polarized in
another. Suppose that we had some material which consisted of long,
nonspherical molecules, longer than they are wide, and suppose that
these molecules were arranged in the substance with their long axes
parallel. Then what happens when the oscillating electric field passes
through this substance? Suppose that because of the structure of the
molecule, the electrons in the substance respond more easily to
oscillations in the direction parallel to the axes of the molecules
than they would respond if the electric field tries to push them at
right angles to the molecular axis. In this way we expect a different
response for polarization in one direction than for polarization at
right angles to that direction. Let us call the direction of the axes
of the molecules the <em class="emph">optic axis</em>. When the
polarization is in the direction of the optic axis the
index of refraction is different than it would be if the direction of
polarization were at right angles to it. Such a substance is called
<em class="emph">birefringent</em>. It has two refrangibilities, i.e., two indexes of
refraction, depending on the direction of the polarization inside the
substance. What kind of a substance can be birefringent? In a
birefringent substance there must be a certain amount of lining up, for
one reason or another, of unsymmetrical molecules. Certainly a cubic
crystal, which has the symmetry of a cube, cannot be birefringent. But
long needlelike crystals undoubtedly contain molecules that are
asymmetric, and one observes this effect very easily.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Let us see what effects we would expect if we were to shine polarized
light through a plate of a birefringent substance. If the polarization
is parallel to the optic axis, the light will go through with one
velocity; if the polarization is perpendicular to the axis, the light
is transmitted with a different velocity. An interesting situation
arises when, say, light is linearly polarized at $45^\circ$ to the
optic axis. Now the $45^\circ$ polarization, we have already noticed,
can be represented as a superposition of the $x$- and the
$y$-polarizations of equal amplitude and in phase, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F2">33–2</a>(a). Since the $x$- and $y$-polarizations travel
with different velocities, their phases change at a different rate as
the light passes through the substance. So, although at the start the
$x$- and $y$-vibrations are in phase, inside the material the phase
difference between $x$- and $y$-vibrations is proportional to the depth
in the substance. As the light proceeds through the material the
polarization changes as shown in the series of diagrams in
Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F2">33–2</a>. If the thickness of the plate is just right to
introduce a $90^\circ$ phase shift between the $x$-
and $y$-polarizations, as in Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F2">33–2</a>(c), the light will come
out circularly polarized. Such a thickness is called a quarter-wave
plate, because it introduces a quarter-cycle phase difference between
the $x$- and the $y$-polarizations. If linearly polarized light is sent
through two quarter-wave plates, it will come out plane-polarized again,
but at right angles to the original direction, as we can see from
Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F2">33–2</a>(e).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S3-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">One can easily illustrate this phenomenon with a piece of
cellophane. Cellophane is made of long, fibrous molecules, and is not
isotropic, since the fibers lie preferentially in a certain
direction. To demonstrate birefringence we need a beam of linearly
polarized light, and we can obtain this conveniently by passing
unpolarized light through a sheet of polaroid. Polaroid, which we will
discuss later in more detail, has the useful property that it
transmits light that is linearly polarized parallel to the axis of the
polaroid with very little absorption, but light polarized in a
direction perpendicular to the axis of the polaroid is strongly
absorbed. When we pass unpolarized light through a sheet of polaroid,
only that part of the unpolarized beam which is vibrating parallel to
the axis of the polaroid gets through, so that the transmitted beam is
linearly polarized. This same property of polaroid is also useful in
detecting the direction of polarization of a linearly polarized beam,
or in determining whether a beam is linearly polarized or not. One
simply passes the beam of light through the polaroid sheet and rotates
the polaroid in the plane normal to the beam. If the beam is linearly
polarized, it will not be transmitted through the sheet when the axis
of the polaroid is normal to the direction of polarization. The
transmitted beam is only slightly attenuated when the axis of the
polaroid sheet is rotated through $90^\circ$. If the transmitted
intensity is independent of the orientation of the polaroid, the beam
is not linearly polarized.</p>

<div id="Ch33-S3-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">To demonstrate the birefringence of cellophane, we use two sheets of
polaroid, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F3">33–3</a>. The first gives us a
linearly polarized beam which we pass through the cellophane and then
through the second polaroid sheet, which serves to detect any effect
the cellophane may have had on the polarized light passing through
it. If we first set the axes of the two polaroid sheets perpendicular
to each other and remove the cellophane, no light will be transmitted
through the second polaroid. If we now introduce the cellophane
between the two polaroid sheets, and rotate the sheet about the beam
axis, we observe that in general the cellophane makes it possible for
some light to pass through the second polaroid. However, there are two
orientations of the cellophane sheet, at right angles to each other,
which permit no light to pass through the second polaroid. These
orientations in which linearly polarized light is transmitted through
the cellophane with no effect on the direction of polarization must be
the directions parallel and perpendicular to the optic axis of the
cellophane sheet.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We suppose that the light passes through the cellophane with two
different velocities in these two different orientations, but it is
transmitted without changing the direction of polarization. When the
cellophane is turned halfway between these two orientations, as shown
in Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F3">33–3</a>, we see that the light transmitted through
the second polaroid is bright.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">It just happens that ordinary cellophane used in commercial packaging
is very close to a half-wave thickness for most of the colors in white
light. Such a sheet will turn the axis of linearly polarized light
through $90^\circ$ if the incident linearly polarized beam makes an
angle of $45^\circ$ with the optic axis, so that the beam emerging
from the cellophane is then vibrating in the right direction to pass
through the second polaroid sheet.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S3-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">If we use white light in our demonstration, the cellophane sheet will
be of the proper half-wave thickness only for a particular component
of the white light, and the transmitted beam will have the color of
this component. The color transmitted depends on the thickness of the
cellophane sheet, and we can vary the effective thickness of the
cellophane by tilting it so that the light passes through the
cellophane at an angle, consequently through a longer path in the
cellophane. As the sheet is tilted the transmitted color changes. With
cellophane of different thicknesses one can construct filters that
will transmit different colors. These filters have the interesting
property that they transmit one color when the two polaroid sheets
have their axes perpendicular, and the complementary color when the
axes of the two polaroid sheets are parallel.</p>

<div id="Ch33-S3-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Another interesting application of aligned molecules is quite
practical. Certain plastics are composed of very long and complicated
molecules all twisted together. When the plastic is solidified very
carefully, the molecules are all twisted in a mass, so that there are
as many aligned in one direction as another, and so the plastic is not
particularly birefringent. Usually there are strains and stresses
introduced when the material is solidified, so the material is not
perfectly homogeneous. However, if we apply tension to a piece of this
plastic material, it is as if we were pulling a whole tangle of
strings, and there will be more strings preferentially aligned
parallel to the tension than in any other direction. So when a stress
is applied to certain plastics, they become birefringent, and one can
see the effects of the birefringence by passing polarized light
through the plastic. If we examine the transmitted light through a
polaroid sheet, patterns of light and dark fringes will be observed
(in color, if white light is used). The patterns move as stress is
applied to the sample, and by counting the fringes and seeing where
most of them are, one can determine what the stress is. Engineers use
this phenomenon as a means of finding the stresses in odd-shaped
pieces that are difficult to calculate.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S3-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Another interesting example of a way of obtaining birefringence is by
means of a liquid substance. Consider a liquid composed of long
asymmetric molecules which carry a plus or minus average charge near
the ends of the molecule, so that the molecule is an electric
dipole. In the collisions in the liquid the molecules will ordinarily
be randomly oriented, with as many molecules pointed in one direction
as in another. If we apply an electric field the molecules will tend
to line up, and the moment they line up the liquid becomes
birefringent. With two polaroid sheets and a transparent cell
containing such a polar liquid, we can devise an arrangement with the
property that light is transmitted only when the electric field is
applied. So we have an electrical switch for light, which is called a
<em class="emph">Kerr cell</em>. This effect, that an electric field
can produce birefringence in certain liquids, is called the
Kerr effect.

<p class="p">So far we have considered substances in which the refractive index is
different for light polarized in different directions. Of very
practical value are those crystals and other substances in which not
only the index, but also the coefficient of absorption, is different
for light polarized in different directions. By the same arguments
which supported the idea of birefringence, it is understandable that
absorption can vary with the direction in which the charges are forced
to vibrate in an anisotropic substance. Tourmaline is an old, famous
example and polaroid is another. Polaroid consists of a thin layer of
small crystals of herapathite (a salt of iodine and quinine), all
aligned with their axes parallel. These crystals absorb light when the
oscillations are in one direction, and they do not absorb appreciably
when the oscillations are in the other direction.</p>

<p class="p">Suppose that we send light into a polaroid sheet polarized linearly at
an angle $\theta$ to the passing direction. What intensity will come
through?  This incident light can be resolved into a component
perpendicular to the pass direction which is proportional
to $\sin\theta$, and a component along the pass direction which is
proportional to $\cos\theta$. The amplitude which comes out of the
polaroid is only the cosine $\theta$ part; the $\sin\theta$ component
is absorbed. The amplitude which passes through the polaroid is
smaller than the amplitude which entered, by a
factor $\cos\theta$. The energy which passes through the polaroid, i.e., the
intensity of the light, is proportional to the square
of $\cos\theta$. $\operatorname{Cos}^2\theta$, then, is the intensity
transmitted when the light enters polarized at an angle $\theta$ to
the pass direction. The absorbed intensity, of course, is $\sin^2\theta$.</p>

<p class="p">An interesting paradox is presented by the following situation. We
know that it is not possible to send a beam of light through two
polaroid sheets with their axes crossed at right angles. But if we
place a third polaroid sheet <em class="emph">between</em> the first two, with its
pass axis at $45^\circ$ to the crossed axes, some light is
transmitted. We know that polaroid absorbs light, it does not create
anything. Nevertheless, the addition of a third polaroid at $45^\circ$
allows more light to get through. The analysis of this phenomenon is
left as an exercise for the student.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">One of the most interesting examples of polarization is not in
complicated crystals or difficult substances, but in one of the simplest
and most familiar of situations—the reflection of light from a
surface. Believe it or not, when light is reflected from a glass surface
it may be polarized, and the physical explanation of this is very
simple. It was discovered empirically by
Brewster
that light reflected from a surface is completely
polarized if the reflected beam and the beam refracted into the material
form a right angle. The situation is illustrated in
Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F4">33–4</a>. If the incident beam is polarized in the plane of
incidence, there will be no reflection at all. Only if the incident beam
is polarized normal to the plane of incidence will it be reflected. The
reason is very easy to understand. In the reflecting material the light
is polarized transversely, and we know that it is the motion of the
charges in the material which generates the emergent beam, which we call
the reflected beam. The source of this so-called reflected light is not
simply that the incident beam is reflected; our deeper understanding of
this phenomenon tells us that the incident beam drives an oscillation of
the charges in the material, which in turn generates the reflected beam.
From Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F4">33–4</a> it is clear that only oscillations normal
to the paper can radiate in the direction of reflection, and
consequently the reflected beam will be polarized normal to the plane of
incidence. If the incident beam is polarized in the plane of incidence,
there will be no reflected light.</p>

<p class="p">This phenomenon is readily demonstrated by reflecting a linearly

present different angles of incidence to the polarized beam, sharp
attenuation of the reflected intensity is observed when the angle of
incidence passes through Brewster’s angle. This attenuation is observed only if the plane of polarization
lies in the plane of incidence. If the plane of polarization is normal
to the plane of incidence, the usual reflected intensity is observed at
all angles.

<div id="Ch33-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Another most remarkable effect of polarization is observed in
materials composed of molecules which do not have reflection symmetry:
molecules shaped something like a corkscrew, or like a gloved hand, or
any shape which, if viewed through a mirror, would be reversed in the
same way that a left-hand glove reflects as a right-hand
glove. Suppose all of the molecules in the substance are the same,
i.e., none is a mirror image of any other. Such a substance may show
an interesting effect called optical activity, whereby as linearly
polarized light passes through the substance, the direction of
polarization rotates about the beam axis.</p>

<div id="Ch33-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">To understand the phenomenon of optical activity requires some
calculation, but we can see qualitatively how the effect might come
about, without actually carrying out the calculations. Consider an
asymmetric molecule in the shape of a spiral, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F5">33–5</a>. Molecules need not actually be shaped like a
corkscrew in order to exhibit optical activity, but this is a simple
shape which we shall take as a typical example of those that do not have
reflection symmetry. When a light beam linearly polarized along the
$y$-direction falls on this molecule, the electric field will drive
charges up and down the helix, thereby generating a current in the
$y$-direction and radiating an electric field $E_y$ polarized in the
$y$-direction. However, if the electrons are constrained to move along
the spiral, they must also move in the $x$-direction as they are driven
up and down. When a current is flowing up the spiral, it is also flowing
into the paper at $z = z_1$ and out of the paper at $z = z_1 + A$, if
$A$ is the diameter of our molecular spiral. One might suppose that the
current in the $x$-direction would produce no net radiation, since the
currents are in opposite directions on opposite sides of the spiral.
However, if we consider the $x$-components of the electric field
arriving at $z = z_2$, we see that the field radiated by the current
at $z = z_1 + A$ and the field radiated from $z = z_1$ arrive at $z_2$
separated in time by the amount $A/c$, and thus separated in phase
by $\pi + \omega A/c$. Since the phase difference is not exactly $\pi$, the
two fields do not cancel exactly, and we are left with a small
$x$-component in the electric field generated by the motion of the
electrons in the molecule, whereas the driving electric field had only a
$y$-component. This small $x$-component, added to the large
$y$-component, produces a resultant field that is tilted slightly with
respect to the $y$-axis, the original direction of polarization. As the
light moves through the material, the direction of polarization rotates
about the beam axis. By drawing a few examples and considering the
currents that will be set in motion by an incident electric field, one
can convince himself that the existence of optical activity and the sign
of the rotation are independent of the orientation of the molecules.</p>

striking a glass surface, where it is partly reflected and partly
refracted into the glass. Let us suppose that the incident beam, of
unit amplitude, is linearly polarized normal to the plane of the
paper. We will call the amplitude of the reflected wave $b$, and the
amplitude of the refracted wave $a$. The refracted and reflected waves
will, of course, be linearly polarized, and the electric field vectors
of the incident, reflected, and refracted waves are all parallel to
each other. Figure <a href="#Ch33-F6">33–6</a>(b) shows the same situation, but

<p class="p">We wish to calculate how strong the reflection is in the two situations
illustrated in Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F6">33–6</a>(a) and <a href="#Ch33-F6">33–6</a>(b).
We already know that when the angle between the reflected beam and
refracted beam is a right angle, there will be no reflected wave in
Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F6">33–6</a>(b), but let us see if we cannot get a quantitative
answer—an exact formula for $B$ and $b$ as a function of the angle of
incidence, $i$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The principle that we must understand is as follows. The currents that
are generated in the glass produce two waves. First, they produce the
reflected wave. Moreover, we know that if there were no currents
generated in the glass, the incident wave would continue straight into
the glass. Remember that all the sources in the world make the net
field. The source of the incident light beam produces a field of unit
amplitude, which would move into the glass along the dotted line in the
figure. This field is not observed, and therefore the currents
generated in the glass must produce a field of amplitude $-1$, which
moves along the dotted line. Using this fact, we will calculate the
amplitude of the refracted waves, $a$ and $A$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S6-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">In Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F6">33–6</a>(a) we see that the field of amplitude $b$
is radiated by the motion of charges inside the glass which are
responding to a field $a$ inside the glass, and that therefore $b$ is
proportional to $a$. We might suppose that since our two figures are
exactly the same, except for the direction of polarization, the
ratio $B/A$ would be the same as the ratio $b/a$. This is not quite true,
however, because in Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F6">33–6</a>(b) the polarization
directions are not all parallel to each other, as they are in
Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F6">33–6</a>(a). It is only the component of $A$ which is
perpendicular to $B$, $A \cos\,(i + r)$, which is effective in
producing $B$. The correct expression for the proportionality is then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:33:1}
\frac{b}{a}=\frac{B}{A \cos\,(i + r)}.
\end{equation}</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S6-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we use a trick. We know that in both (a) and (b) of
Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F6">33–6</a> the electric field in the glass must produce
oscillations of the charges, which generate a field of amplitude $-1$,
polarized parallel to the incident beam, and moving in the direction of
the dotted line. But we see from part (b) of the figure that only the
component of $A$ that is normal to the dashed line has the right
polarization to produce this field, whereas in Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F6">33–6</a>(a)
the full amplitude $a$ is effective, since the polarization of wave $a$
is parallel to the polarization of the wave of amplitude $-1$. Therefore
we can write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:33:2}
\frac{A \cos\,(i - r)}{a}=\frac{-1}{-1},
\end{equation}
since the two amplitudes on the left side of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI332">33.2</a>)
each produce the wave of amplitude $-1$.</p>

<div id="Ch33-S6-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Dividing Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI331">33.1</a>) by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI332">33.2</a>), we obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:33:3}
\frac{B}{b}=\frac{\cos\,(i+r)}{\cos\,(i-r)},
\end{equation}
a result which we can check against what we already know. If we set
$(i + r) = 90^\circ$, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI333">33.3</a>) gives $B = 0$, as
Brewster says it should be, so our results so far are at least not
obviously wrong.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S6-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">We have assumed unit amplitudes for the incident waves, so that
$\abs{B}^2/1^2$ is the reflection coefficient for waves polarized in
the plane of incidence, and $\abs{b}^2/1^2$ is the reflection
coefficient for waves polarized normal to the plane of incidence. The
ratio of these two reflection coefficients is determined by
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI333">33.3</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S6-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we perform a miracle, and compute not just the ratio, but each
coefficient $\abs{B}^2$ and $\abs{b}^2$ individually! We know from the
conservation of energy that the energy in the refracted wave must be
equal to the incident energy minus the energy in the reflected wave,
$1-\abs{B}^2$ in one case, $1-\abs{b}^2$ in the other. Furthermore,
the energy which passes into the glass in Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F6">33–6</a>(b)
is to the energy which passes into the glass in Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F6">33–6</a>(a)
as the ratio of the squares of the refracted amplitudes,
$\abs{A}^2/\abs{a}^2$. One might ask whether we really know how to
compute the energy inside the glass, because, after all, there are
energies of motion of the atoms in addition to the energy in the
electric field. But it is obvious that all of the various contributions
to the total energy will be proportional to the square of the amplitude
of the electric field. Therefore we can write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:33:4}
\frac{1-\abs{B}^2}{1-\abs{b}^2}=
\frac{\abs{A}^2}{\abs{a}^2}.
\end{equation}</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S6-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">We now substitute Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI332">33.2</a>) to eliminate $A/a$ from the
expression above, and express $B$ in terms of $b$ by means of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI333">33.3</a>):
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:33:5}
\frac{1-\abs{b}^2\,\dfrac{\cos^2\,(i+r)}{\cos^2\,(i-r)}}
{1-\abs{b}^2}=\frac{1}{\cos^2\,(i-r)}.
\end{equation}
This equation contains only one unknown amplitude, $b$. Solving for
$\abs{b}^2$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:33:6}
\abs{b}^2=\frac{\sin^2\,(i-r)}{\sin^2\,(i+r)}
\end{equation}
and, with the aid of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI333">33.3</a>),
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:33:7}
\abs{B}^2=\frac{\tan^2\,(i-r)}{\tan^2\,(i+r)}.
\end{equation}
So we have found the reflection coefficient $\abs{b}^2$ for an
incident wave polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and
also the reflection coefficient $\abs{B}^2$ for an incident wave
polarized in the plane of incidence!</p>

<p class="p">It is possible to go on with arguments of this nature and deduce that
$b$ is real. To prove this, one must consider a case where light is
coming from both sides of the glass surface at the same time, a
situation not easy to arrange experimentally, but fun to analyze
theoretically. If we analyze this general case, we can prove that $b$
must be real, and therefore, in fact, that $b = \pm\sin\,(i -
r)/\sin\,(i + r)$. It is even possible to determine the sign by
considering the case of a very, very thin layer in which there is
reflection from the front and from the back surfaces, and calculating
how much light is reflected. We know how much light should be
reflected by a thin layer, because we know how much current is
generated, and we have even worked out the fields produced by such
currents.</p>

b=-\frac{\sin\,(i-r)}{\sin\,(i+r)},\quad

Fresnel’s reflection formulas.</p>

practically equal to the angles, as are also the tangents. But we know
that $\sin i/\sin r = n$, and when the angles are small, $i/r \approx
n$. It is thus easy to show that the coefficient of reflection for
normal incidence is
\begin{equation*}
B^2=b^2=\frac{(n-1)^2}{(n+1)^2}.

first to be discovered: anomalous refraction. Sailors visiting Iceland
brought back to Europe crystals of Iceland spar (CaCO$_3$) which had
the amusing property of making anything seen through the crystal
appear doubled, i.e., as two images. This came to the attention of
Huygens, and played an important
role in the discovery of polarization. As is often the case, the
phenomena which are discovered first are the hardest, ultimately, to
explain. It is only after we understand a physical concept thoroughly

<p class="p">Anomalous refraction is a particular case of the same
birefringence that we considered earlier. Anomalous
refraction comes about when the optic axis, the long axis of our
asymmetric molecules, is <em class="emph">not</em> parallel to the surface of the
crystal. In Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F7">33–7</a> are drawn two pieces of birefringent
material, with the optic axis as shown. In
the upper figure, the incident beam falling on the material is linearly
polarized in a direction perpendicular to the optic axis of the
material. When this beam strikes the surface of the material, each point
on the surface acts as a source of a wave which travels into the crystal
with velocity $v_\perp$, the velocity of light in the crystal when the
plane of polarization is normal to the optic axis. The
wavefront is just the envelope or locus of all these
little spherical waves, and this wavefront moves
straight through the crystal and out the other side. This is just the
ordinary behavior we would expect, and this ray is called the
<em class="emph">ordinary ray</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch33-S7-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">In the lower figure the linearly polarized light falling on the
crystal has its direction of polarization turned through $90^\circ$,
so that the optic axis lies in the plane of polarization. When we now
consider the little waves originating at any point on the surface of
the crystal, we see that they do not spread out as spherical
waves. Light travelling along the optic axis travels with
velocity $v_\perp$ because the polarization is perpendicular to the optic axis,
whereas the light travelling perpendicular to the optic axis travels
with velocity $v_\parallel$ because the polarization is parallel to
the optic axis. In a birefringent material
$v_\parallel\neq v_\perp$, and in the figure $v_\parallel &lt; v_\perp$. A
more complete analysis will show that the waves spread out on the
surface of an ellipsoid, with the optic axis as major axis of the
ellipsoid. The envelope of all these elliptical waves is the
wavefront which proceeds through the crystal in the
direction shown. Again, at the back surface the beam will be deflected
just as it was at the front surface, so that the light emerges parallel
to the incident beam, but displaced from it. Clearly, this beam does not
follow Snell’s law, but goes in an extraordinary direction. It is
therefore called the <em class="emph">extraordinary ray</em>.</p>

<p class="p">When an unpolarized beam strikes an anomalously refracting crystal, it
is separated into an ordinary ray, which travels straight through in
the normal manner, and an extraordinary ray which is displaced as it
passes through the crystal. These two emergent rays are linearly
polarized at right angles to each other. That this is true can be
readily demonstrated with a sheet of polaroid to analyze the
polarization of the emergent rays. We can also demonstrate that our
interpretation of this phenomenon is correct by sending linearly
polarized light into the crystal. By properly orienting the direction
of polarization of the incident beam, we can make this light go
straight through without splitting, or we can make it go through
without splitting but with a displacement.</p>

polarization cases, namely $x$ and $y$ in various amounts and phases.
Other pairs could equally well have been used. Polarization along any
two perpendicular axes $x'$, $y'$ inclined to $x$ and $y$ would serve as
well [for example, any polarization can be made up of superpositions of
cases (a) and (e) of Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F2">33–2</a>]. It is interesting, however,
that this idea can be extended to other cases also. For example, any
<em class="emph">linear</em> polarization can be made up by superposing suitable
amounts at suitable phases of right and left <em class="emph">circular</em>
polarizations [cases (c) and (g) of Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F2">33–2</a>], since two
equal vectors rotating in opposite directions add to give a single
vector oscillating in a straight line (Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F8">33–8</a>). If the
phase of one is shifted relative to the other, the line is inclined.
Thus all the pictures of Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F1">33–1</a> could be labeled “the
superposition of equal amounts of right and left circularly polarized
light at various relative phases.” As the left slips behind the right
in phase, the direction of the linear polarization changes. Therefore
optically active materials are, in a sense,
birefringent. Their properties can be
described by saying that they have different indexes for right- and
left-hand circularly polarized light. Superposition of right and left
circularly polarized light of different intensities produces
elliptically polarized light.

Then the $x$-displacement of the electron will respond to the
$E_x$ component of the field, while the $y$-component responds, equally,
to the equal $E_y$ component of the field but $90^\circ$ behind in
phase. That is, the responding electron goes around in a circle, with
angular velocity $\omega$, in response to the rotating electric field of
the light (Fig. <a href="#Ch33-F9">33–9</a>). Depending on the damping
characteristics of the response of the oscillator, the direction of the
displacement $\FLPa$ of the electron, and the direction of the
force $q_e\FLPE$ on it need not be the same but they rotate around
together. The $\FLPE$ may have a component at right angles to $\FLPa$,
so work is done on the system and a torque $\tau$ is exerted. The work
done per second is $\tau\omega$. Over a period of time $T$ the energy
absorbed is $\tau\omega T$, while $\tau T$ is the angular momentum
delivered to the matter absorbing the energy. We see therefore that
<em class="emph">a beam of right circularly polarized light containing a total
