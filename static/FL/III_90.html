		Nearly fifty years have passed since Richard Feynman taught the introductory
        physics course at Caltech that gave rise to these three volumes, <i>The Feynman
        Lectures on Physics</i>. In those fifty years our understanding of the physical
        world has changed greatly, but <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i> has
        endured. Feynman’s lectures are as powerful today as when first published, thanks
        to Feynman’s unique physics insights and pedagogy. They have been studied
        worldwide by novices and mature physicists alike; they have been translated into
        at least a dozen languages with more than 1.5 millions copies printed in the
        English language alone. Perhaps no other set of physics books has had such wide
        impact, for so long.</p>

        This <i>New Millennium Edition</i> ushers in a new era for <i>The Feynman
        Lectures on Physics (FLP)</i>: the twenty-first century era of electronic
        publishing. <i>FLP</i> has been converted to <i>eFLP</i>, with the text and
        equations expressed in the LaTeX electronic typesetting language, and all figures
        redone using modern drawing software.</p>

        The consequences for the <i>print</i> version of this edition are <i>not</i>
        startling; it looks almost the same as the original red books that physics
        students have known and loved for decades. The main differences are an expanded
        and improved index, the correction of 885 errata found by readers over the five
        years since the first printing of the previous edition, and the ease of
        correcting errata that future readers may find. To this I shall return

        The <i>eBook Version</i> of this edition, and the <i>Enhanced Electronic
        Version</i> are electronic innovations. By contrast with most eBook versions of
        20th century technical books, whose equations, figures and sometimes even text
        become pixellated when one tries to enlarge them, the LaTeX manuscript of the
        <i>New Millennium Edition</i> makes it possible to create eBooks of the highest
        quality, in which all features on the page (except photographs) can be enlarged
        without bound and retain their precise shapes and sharpness. And the <i>Enhanced
        Electronic Version</i>, with its audio and blackboard photos from Feynman’s
        original lectures, and its links to other resources, is an innovation that would
        have given Feynman great pleasure.</p>

        These three volumes are a self-contained pedagogical treatise. They are also a
        historical record of Feynman’s 1961–64 undergraduate physics lectures, a course
        required of all Caltech freshmen and sophomores regardless of their majors.</p>

        Readers may wonder, as I have, how Feynman’s lectures impacted the students who
        attended them. Feynman, in his Preface to these volumes, offered a somewhat
        negative view.&nbsp; “I don’t think I did very well by the students,” he wrote.
        Matthew Sands, in his memoir in <i>Feynman’s Tips on Physics</i> expressed a far
        more positive view. Out of curiosity, in spring 2005 I emailed or talked to a
        quasi-random set of 17 students (out of about 150) from Feynman’s 1961–63
        class—some who had great difficulty with the class, and some who mastered it
        with ease; majors in biology, chemistry, engineering, geology, mathematics and
        astronomy, as well as in physics.</p>
        </div>        
        <div id="Ch90-S2-p3" class="para">
		<p class="p">
        The intervening years might have glazed their memories with a euphoric tint, but
        about 80 percent recall Feynman’s lectures as highlights of their college years.
        “It was like going to church.” The lectures were “a transformational
        experience,” “the experience of a lifetime, probably the most important thing I
        got from Caltech.” “I was a biology major but Feynman’s lectures stand out as a
        high point in my undergraduate experience … though I
        must admit I couldn’t do the homework at the time and I hardly turned any of it
        in.” “I was among the least promising of students in this course, and I never
        missed a lecture. … I remember and can still feel
        Feynman’s joy of discovery. … His lectures had an
        … emotional impact that was probably lost in the
        printed <i>Lectures</i>.”</p>
        </div>        
        <div id="Ch90-S2-p4" class="para">
		<p class="p">
        By contrast, several of the students have negative memories due largely to two
        issues: (i) “You couldn’t learn to work the homework problems by attending the
        lectures. Feynman was too slick—he knew tricks and what approximations could be
        made, and had intuition based on experience and genius that a beginning student
        does not possess.” Feynman and colleagues, aware of this flaw in the course,
        addressed it in part with materials that have been incorporated into <i>Feynman’s
        Tips on Physics:</i> three problem-solving lectures by Feynman, and a set of
        exercises and answers assembled by Robert B. Leighton and Rochus Vogt. (ii) “The
        insecurity of not knowing what was likely to be discussed in the next lecture,
        the lack of a text book or reference with any connection to the lecture material,
        and consequent inability for us to read ahead, were very frustrating. 
        … &nbsp;I found the lectures exciting and understandable in the
        hall, but they were Sanskrit outside [when I tried to reconstruct the details].”
        This problem, of course, was solved by these three volumes, the printed version
        of <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>. They became the textbook from which
        Caltech students studied for many years thereafter, and they live on today as one
        of Feynman’s greatest legacies.</p>

        <div id="Ch90-S3-p1" class="para">
		<p class="p">
        <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i> was produced very quickly by Feynman and
        his co-authors, Robert B. Leighton and Matthew Sands, working from and expanding
        on tape recordings and blackboard photos of Feynman’s course lectures<a name=
        "footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> (both of
        which are incorporated into the <i>Enhanced Electronic Version</i> of this <i>New
        Millennium Edition</i>). Given the high speed at which Feynman, Leighton and
        Sands worked, it was inevitable that many errors crept into the first edition.
        Feynman accumulated long lists of claimed errata over the subsequent
        years—errata found by students and faculty at Caltech and by readers around the
        world. In the 1960s and early ’70s, Feynman made time in his intense life to
        check most but not all of the claimed errata for Volumes I and II, and insert
        corrections into subsequent printings. But Feynman’s sense of duty never rose
        high enough above the excitement of discovering new things to make him deal with
        the errata in Volume III.<a name="footnote_source_2" href=
        "#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a> After his untimely death in 1988,
        lists of errata for all three volumes were deposited in the Caltech Archives, and
        there they lay forgotten.</p>

        <div id="Ch90-S3-p2" class="para">
		<p class="p">
        In 2002 Ralph Leighton (son of the late Robert Leighton and compatriot of
        Feynman) informed me of the old errata and a new long list compiled by Ralph’s
        friend Michael Gottlieb. Leighton proposed that Caltech produce a new edition of
        <i>The Feynman Lectures</i> with all errata corrected, and publish it alongside a
        new volume of auxiliary material, <i>Feynman’s Tips on Physics</i>, which he and
        Gottlieb were preparing.</p>

        Feynman was my hero and a close personal friend. When I saw the lists of errata
        and the content of the proposed new volume, I quickly agreed to oversee this
        project on behalf of Caltech (Feynman’s long-time academic home, to which he,
        Leighton and Sands had entrusted all rights and responsibilities for <i>The
        Feynman Lectures</i>). After a year and a half of meticulous work by Gottlieb,
        and careful scrutiny by Dr. Michael Hartl (an outstanding Caltech postdoc who
        vetted all errata plus the new volume), the 2005 <i>Definitive Edition of The
        Feynman Lectures on Physics</i> was born, with about 200 errata corrected and
        accompanied by <i>Feynman’s Tips on Physics</i> by Feynman, Gottlieb and
        Leighton.</p>

        <div id="Ch90-S3-p4" class="para">

        I <i>thought</i> that edition was going to be “Definitive”. What I did not
        anticipate was the enthusiastic response of readers around the world to an appeal
        from Gottlieb to identify further errata, and submit them via a website that
        Gottlieb created and continues to maintain, <i>The Feynman Lectures Website</i>,
        <a href="http://www.feynmanlectures.info/">www.feynmanlectures.info</a>.&nbsp; In
        the five years since then, 965 new errata have been submitted and survived the
        meticulous scrutiny of Gottlieb, Hartl, and Nate Bode (an outstanding Caltech
        physics graduate student, who succeeded Hartl as Caltech’s vetter of errata). Of
        these, 965 vetted errata, 80 were corrected in the fourth printing of the
        <i>Definitive Edition</i> (August 2006) and the remaining 885 are corrected in
        the first printing of this <i>New Millennium Edition</i> (332 in volume I, 263 in
        volume II, and 200 in volume III). For details of the errata, see <a href=

        Clearly, making <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i> error-free has become a
        world-wide community enterprise. On behalf of Caltech I thank the 50 readers who
        have contributed since 2005 and the many more who may contribute over the coming
        years. The names of all contributors are posted at <a href=

        Almost all the errata have been of three types: (i) typographical errors in
        prose; (ii) typographical and mathematical errors in equations, tables and
        figures—sign errors, incorrect numbers (e.g., a 5 that should be a 4), and
        missing subscripts, summation signs, parentheses and terms in equations; (iii)
        incorrect cross references to chapters, tables and figures. These kinds of
        errors, though not terribly serious to a mature physicist, can be frustrating and
        confusing to Feynman’s primary audience: students.</p>

        It is remarkable that among the 1165 errata corrected under my auspices, only
        several do I regard as true errors in physics. An example is Volume II, page 5-9,
        which now says “…no static distribution of charges
        inside a closed <i>grounded</i> conductor can produce any [electric] fields
        outside” (the word grounded was omitted in previous editions). This error was
        pointed out to Feynman by a number of readers, including Beulah Elizabeth Cox, a
        student at The College of William and Mary, who had relied on Feynman’s erroneous
        passage in an exam. To Ms. Cox, Feynman wrote in 1975,<a name="footnote_source_3"
        href="#footnote_3"><sup class="mark">3</sup></a>&nbsp; “Your instructor was right
        not to give you any points, for your answer was wrong, as he demonstrated using
        Gauss’s law. You should, in science, believe logic and arguments, carefully
        drawn, and not authorities. You also read the book correctly and understood it. I
        made a mistake, so the book is wrong. I probably was thinking of a grounded

        Between November 2005 and July 2006, 340 errata were submitted to <i>The Feynman
        Lectures Website</i> <a href=
        "http://www.feynmanlectures.info/">www.feynmanlectures.info</a>. Remarkably, the
        bulk of these came from one person: Dr. Rudolf Pfeiffer, then a physics
        postdoctoral fellow at the University of Vienna, Austria. The publisher, Addison
        Wesley, fixed 80 errata, but balked at fixing more because of cost: the books
        were being printed by a photo-offset process, working from photographic images of
        the pages from the 1960s. Correcting an error involved re-typesetting the entire
        page, and to ensure no new errors crept in, the page was re-typeset twice by two
        different people, then compared and proofread by several other people—a very
        costly process indeed, when hundreds of errata are involved.</p>

        Gottlieb, Pfeiffer and Ralph Leighton were very unhappy about this, so they
        formulated a plan aimed at facilitating the repair of all errata, and also aimed
        at producing eBook and enhanced electronic versions of <i>The Feynman Lectures on
        Physics</i>. They proposed their plan to me, as Caltech’s representative, in
        2007. I was enthusiastic but cautious. After seeing further details, including a
        one-chapter demonstration of the <i>Enhanced Electronic Version</i>, I
        recommended that Caltech cooperate with Gottlieb, Pfeiffer and Leighton in the
        execution of their plan. The plan was approved by three successive chairs of
        Caltech’s Division of Physics, Mathematics and Astronomy—Tom Tombrello, Andrew
        Lange, and Tom Soifer—and the complex legal and contractual details were worked
        out by Caltech’s Intellectual Property Counsel, Adam Cochran. With the
        publication of this <i>New Millennium Edition</i>, the plan has been executed
        successfully, despite its complexity. Specifically:</p>

        Pfeiffer and Gottlieb have converted into LaTeX all three volumes of <i>FLP</i>
        (and also more than 1000 exercises from the Feynman course for incorporation into
        <i>Feynman’s Tips on Physics</i>). The <i>FLP</i> figures were redrawn in modern
        electronic form in India, under guidance of the <i>FLP</i> German translator,
        Henning Heinze, for use in the German edition. Gottlieb and Pfeiffer traded
        non-exclusive use of their LaTeX equations in the German edition (published by
        Oldenbourg) for non-exclusive use of Heinze’s figures in this <i>New
        Millennium</i> English edition. Pfeiffer and Gottlieb have meticulously checked
        all the LaTeX text and equations and all the redrawn figures, and made
        corrections as needed. Nate Bode and I, on behalf of Caltech, have done spot
        checks of text, equations, and figures; and remarkably, we have found no errors.
        Pfeiffer and Gottlieb are unbelievably meticulous and accurate. Gottlieb and
        Pfeiffer arranged for John Sullivan at the Huntington Library to digitize the
        photos of Feynman’s 1962–64 blackboards, and for George Blood Audio to digitize
        the lecture tapes—with financial support and encouragement from Caltech
        Professor Carver Mead, logistical support from Caltech Archivist Shelley Erwin,
        and legal support from Cochran.</p>

        The legal issues were serious: In the 1960s, Caltech licensed to Addison Wesley
        rights to publish the print edition, and in the 1990s, rights to distribute the
        audio of Feynman’s lectures and a variant of an electronic edition. In the 2000s,
        through a sequence of acquisitions of those licenses, the print rights were
        transferred to the Pearson publishing group, while rights to the audio and the
        electronic version were transferred to the Perseus publishing group. Cochran,
        with the aid of Ike Williams, an attorney who specializes in publishing,
        succeeded in uniting all of these rights with Perseus (Basic Books), making
        possible this <i>New Millennium Edition</i>.</p>
