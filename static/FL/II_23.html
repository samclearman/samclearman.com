<span class="tag">23–1</span>Real circuit elements</h3>
<div id="Ch23-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">When looked at from any one pair of terminals, any arbitrary circuit
made up of ideal impedances and generators is, at any given frequency,
equivalent to a generator $\emf$ in series with an impedance $z$.
That comes about because if we put a voltage $V$ across the
terminals and solve all the equations to find the current $I$, we must
get a linear relation between the current and the voltage. Since all
the equations are linear, the result for $I$ must also depend only
linearly on $V$. The most general linear form can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:1}
I=\frac{1}{z}(V-\emf).
\end{equation}

In general, both $z$ and $\emf$ may depend in some complicated way on
the frequency $\omega$. Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII231">23.1</a>), however, is the
relation we would get if behind the two terminals there was just the
generator $\emf(\omega)$ in series with the impedance $z(\omega)$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">There is also the opposite kind of question: If we have any
electromagnetic device at all with two terminals and we <em class="emph">measure</em>
the relation between $I$ and $V$ to determine $\emf$ and $z$ as
functions of frequency, can we find a combination of our ideal elements
that is equivalent to the internal impedance $z$? The answer is that for
any reasonable—that is, physically meaningful—function $z(\omega)$,
it <em class="emph">is</em> possible to <em class="emph">approximate</em> the situation to as high an
accuracy as you wish with a circuit containing a finite set of ideal
elements. We don’t want to consider the general problem now, but only
look at what might be expected from physical arguments for a few cases.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">If we think of a real resistor, we know that the current through it
will produce a magnetic field. So any real resistor should also have
some inductance. Also, when a resistor has a potential difference
across it, there must be charges on the ends of the resistor to
produce the necessary electric fields. As the voltage changes, the
charges will change in proportion, so the resistor will also have some
capacitance. We expect that a <em class="emph">real</em> resistor might have the
equivalent circuit shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F1">23–1</a>. In a
well-designed resistor, the so-called “parasitic” elements $L$
and $C$ are small, so that at the frequencies for which it is intended,
$\omega L$ is much less than $R$, and $1/\omega C$ is much greater
than $R$. It may therefore be possible to neglect them. As the
frequency is raised, however, they will eventually become important,
and a resistor begins to look like a resonant circuit.</p>

frequencies.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">A real inductance is also not equal to the idealized inductance, whose
impedance is $i\omega L$. A real coil of wire will have some
resistance, so at low frequencies the coil is really equivalent to an
inductance in series with some resistance, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F2">23–2</a>(a). But, you are thinking, the resistance and
inductance are <em class="emph">together</em> in a real coil—the resistance is spread
all along the wire, so it is mixed in with the inductance. We should
probably use a circuit more like the one in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F2">23–2</a>(b),
which has several little $R$’s and $L$’s in series. But the total
impedance of such a circuit is just $\sum R+\sum i\omega L$, which is
equivalent to the simpler diagram of part (a).</p>

<p class="p">As we go up in frequency with a real coil, the approximation of an
inductance plus a resistance is no longer very good. The charges that
must build up on the wires to make the voltages will become important.
It is as if there were little condensers across the turns of the coil,
as sketched in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F3">23–3</a>(a). We might try to approximate
the real coil by the circuit in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F3">23–3</a>(b). At low
frequencies, this circuit can be imitated fairly well by the simpler one
in part (c) of the figure (which is again the same resonant circuit we
found for the high-frequency model of a resistor). For higher
frequencies, however, the more complicated circuit of
Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F3">23–3</a>(b) is better. In fact, the more accurately you
wish to represent the actual impedance of a real, physical inductance,
the more ideal elements you will have to use in the artificial model of
it.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s look a little more closely at what goes on in a real coil. The
impedance of an inductance goes as $\omega L$, so it becomes zero at
low frequencies—it is a “short circuit”: all we see is the
resistance of the wire. As we go up in frequency, $\omega L$ soon
becomes much larger than $R$, and the coil looks pretty much like an
ideal inductance. As we go still higher, however, the capacities
become important. Their impedance is proportional to $1/\omega C$,
which is large for small $\omega$. For small enough frequencies a
condenser is an “open circuit,” and when it is in parallel with
something else, it draws no current. But at high frequencies, the
current prefers to flow into the capacitance between the turns, rather
than through the inductance. So the current in the coil jumps from one
turn to the other and doesn’t bother to go around and around where it
has to buck the emf. So although we may have <em class="emph">intended</em> that the
current should go around the loop, it will take the easier path—the
path of least impedance.</p>

<div id="Ch23-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">If the subject had been one of popular interest, this effect would
have been called “the high-frequency barrier,” or some such
name. The same kind of thing happens in all subjects. In aerodynamics,
if you try to make things go faster than the speed of sound when they
were designed for lower speeds, they don’t work. It doesn’t mean that
there is a great “barrier” there; it just means that the object
should be redesigned. So this coil which we designed as an
“inductance” is not going to work as a good inductance, but as some
other kind of thing at very high frequencies. For high frequencies, we
have to find a new design.</p>

<span class="tag">23–2</span>A capacitor at high frequencies</h3>
<div id="Ch23-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we want to discuss in detail the behavior of a capacitor—a
geometrically ideal capacitor—as the frequency gets larger and
larger, so we can see the transition of its properties. (We prefer to
use a capacitor instead of an inductance, because the geometry of a
pair of plates is much less complicated than the geometry of a coil.)
We consider the capacitor shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F4">23–4</a>(a), which
consists of two parallel circular plates connected to an external
generator by a pair of wires. If we charge the capacitor with
<span class="text smallcaps">dc</span>, there will be a positive charge on one plate and a
negative charge on the other; and there will be a uniform electric
field between the plates.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now suppose that instead of <span class="text smallcaps">dc</span>, we put an <span class="text smallcaps">ac</span> of low
frequency on the plates. (We will find out later what is “low” and
what is “high”.) Say we connect the capacitor to a lower-frequency
generator. As the voltage alternates, the positive charge on the top
plate is taken off and negative charge is put on. While that is
happening, the electric field disappears and then builds up in the
opposite direction. As the charge sloshes back and forth slowly, the
electric field follows. At each instant the electric field is uniform,
as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F4">23–4</a>(b), except for some edge effects
which we are going to disregard. We can write the magnitude
of the electric field as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:2}
E=E_0e^{i\omega t},
\end{equation}

where $E_0$ is a constant.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Now will that continue to be right as the frequency goes up? No, because
as the electric field is going up and down, there is a flux of electric
field through any loop like $\Gamma_1$ in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F4">23–4</a>(a).
And, as you know, a changing electric field acts to produce a magnetic
field. One of Maxwell’s equations says that when there is a varying electric field, as there is
here, there has got to be a line integral of the magnetic field. The
integral of the magnetic field around a closed ring, multiplied
by $c^2$, is equal to the time rate-of-change of the electric flux
through the area inside the ring (if there are no currents):
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:3}
c^2\oint_\Gamma\FLPB\cdot d\FLPs=\ddt{}{t}\kern{-1.7ex}
\underset{\text{inside $\Gamma$}}{\int}
\FLPE\cdot\FLPn\,da.
\end{equation}

So how much magnetic field is there? That’s not very hard. Suppose
that we take the loop $\Gamma_1$, which is a circle of radius $r$. We
can see from symmetry that the magnetic field goes around as shown in
the figure. Then the line integral of $\FLPB$ is $2\pi rB$. And, since
the electric field is uniform, the flux of the electric field is
simply $E$ multiplied by $\pi r^2$, the area of the circle:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:4}
c^2B\cdot2\pi r=\ddp{}{t}\,E\cdot\pi r^2.
\end{equation}

The derivative of $E$ with respect to time is, for our alternating
field, simply $i\omega E_0e^{i\omega t}$. So we find that our
capacitor has the magnetic field
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:5}
B=\frac{i\omega r}{2c^2}\,E_0e^{i\omega t}.
\end{equation}

In other words, the magnetic field also oscillates and has a strength
proportional to $r$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">What is the effect of that? When there is a magnetic field that is
varying, there will be induced electric fields and the capacitor will
begin to act a little bit like an inductance. As the frequency goes
up, the magnetic field gets stronger; it is proportional to the rate
of change of $E$, and so to $\omega$. The impedance of the capacitor
will no longer be simply $1/i\omega C$.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s continue to raise the frequency and to analyze what happens more
carefully. We have a magnetic field that goes sloshing back and
forth. But then the electric field cannot be uniform, as we have
assumed! When there is a varying magnetic field, there must be a line
integral of the electric field—because of Faraday’s law. So if there
is an appreciable magnetic field, as begins to happen at high
frequencies, the electric field cannot be the same at all distances
from the center. The electric field must change with $r$ so that the
line integral of the electric field can equal the changing flux of the
magnetic field.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s see if we can figure out the correct electric field. We can do
that by computing a “correction” to the uniform field we originally
assumed for low frequencies. Let’s call the uniform field $E_1$, which
will still be $E_0e^{i\omega t}$, and write the correct field as
\begin{equation*}
E=E_1+E_2,
\end{equation*}

where $E_2$ is the correction due to the changing magnetic field. For
any $\omega$ we will write the field at the center of the condenser
as $E_0e^{i\omega t}$ (thereby defining $E_0$), so that we have no
correction at the center; $E_2=0$ at $r=0$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">To find $E_2$ we can use the integral form of Faraday’s law:
\begin{equation*}
\oint_\Gamma\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs=-\ddt{}{t}(\text{flux of $B$}).
\end{equation*}

The integrals are simple if we take them for the curve $\Gamma_2$,
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F4">23–4</a>(b), which goes up along the axis,
out radially the distance $r$ along the top plate, down vertically to
the bottom plate, and back to the axis. The line integral of $E_1$
around this curve is, of course, zero; so only $E_2$ contributes, and
its integral is just $-E_2(r)\cdot h$, where $h$ is the spacing
between the plates. (We call $E$ positive if it points upward.) This
is equal to minus the rate of change of the flux of $\FLPB$, which we have
to get by an integral over the shaded area $S$ inside $\Gamma_2$ in
Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F4">23–4</a>(b). The flux through a vertical strip of
width $dr$ is $B(r)h\,dr$, so the total flux is
\begin{equation*}
h\int B(r)\,dr.
\end{equation*}

Setting $-\ddpl{}{t}$ of the flux equal to the line integral of $E_2$,
we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:6}
E_2(r)=\ddp{}{t}\int B(r)\,dr.
\end{equation}

Notice that the $h$ cancels out; the fields don’t depend on the
separation of the plates.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Using Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII235">23.5</a>) for $B(r)$, we have
\begin{equation*}
E_2(r)=\ddp{}{t}\,\frac{i\omega r^2}{4c^2}\,E_0e^{i\omega t}.
\end{equation*}

The time derivative just brings down another factor $i\omega$; we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:7}
E_2(r)=-\frac{\omega^2r^2}{4c^2}\,E_0e^{i\omega t}.
\end{equation}

As we expect, the induced field tends to <em class="emph">reduce</em> the electric
field farther out. The corrected field $E=E_1+E_2$ is then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:8}
E=E_1+E_2=\biggl(1-\frac{1}{4}\,\frac{\omega^2r^2}{c^2}

<p class="p">We could now use our results to calculate the impedance of the
capacitor at high frequencies. Knowing the electric field, we could
compute the charges on the plates and find out how the current through
the capacitor depends on the frequency $\omega$, but we are not
interested in that problem for the moment. We are more interested in
seeing what happens as we continue to go up with the frequency—to
see what happens at even higher frequencies. Aren’t we already
finished?  No, because we have corrected the electric field, which
means that the magnetic field we have calculated is no longer
right. The magnetic field of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII235">23.5</a>) is approximately
right, but it is only a first approximation. So let’s call
it $B_1$. We should then rewrite Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII235">23.5</a>) as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:9}
B_1=\frac{i\omega r}{2c^2}\,E_0e^{i\omega t}.
\end{equation}

You will remember that this field was produced by the variation
of $E_1$. Now the correct magnetic field will be that produced by the
total electric field $E_1+E_2$. If we write the magnetic field
as $B=B_1+B_2$, the second term is just the additional field produced
by $E_2$. To find $B_2$ we can go through the same arguments we have used
to find $B_1$; the line integral of $B_2$ around the curve $\Gamma_1$
is equal to the rate of change of the flux of $E_2$
through $\Gamma_1$. We will just have Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII234">23.4</a>) again with $B$
replaced by $B_2$ and $E$ replaced by $E_2$:
\begin{equation*}
c^2B_2\cdot2\pi r=\ddt{}{t}(\text{flux of $E_2$ through $\Gamma_1$}).
\end{equation*}

Since $E_2$ varies with radius, to obtain its flux we must integrate
over the circular surface inside $\Gamma_1$. Using $2\pi r\,dr$ as the
element of area, this integral is
\begin{equation}
\int_0^rE_2(r)\cdot2\pi r\,dr.\notag
\end{equation}

So we get for $B_2(r)$
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:10}
B_2(r)=\frac{1}{rc^2}\,\ddp{}{t}
\int E_2(r)r\,dr.
\end{equation}

Using $E_2(r)$ from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII237">23.7</a>), we need the integral
of $r^3\,dr$, which is, of course, $r^4/4$. Our correction to the
magnetic field becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:11}
B_2(r)=-\frac{i\omega^3r^3}{16c^4}\,E_0e^{i\omega t}.
\end{equation}

</div>
<div id="Ch23-S2-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">But we are still not finished! If the magnetic field $B$ is not the
same as we first thought, then we have incorrectly computed $E_2$. We
must make a further correction to $E$, which comes from the extra
magnetic field $B_2$. Let’s call this additional correction to the
electric field $E_3$. It is related to the magnetic field $B_2$ in the
same way that $E_2$ was related to $B_1$. We can use
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII236">23.6</a>) all over again just by changing the subscripts:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:12}
E_3(r)=\ddp{}{t}\int B_2(r)\,dr.
\end{equation}

Using our result, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2311">23.11</a>), for $B_2$, the new
correction to the electric field is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:13}
E_3(r)=+\frac{\omega^4r^4}{64c^4}\,E_0e^{i\omega t}.
\end{equation}

Writing our doubly corrected electric field as $E=E_1+E_2+E_3$, we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:14}
E=E_0e^{i\omega t}\biggl[
1-\frac{1}{2^2}\biggl(\frac{\omega r}{c}\biggr)^2\kern{-1.25ex}+
\frac{1}{2^2\cdot4^2}\biggl(\frac{\omega r}{c}\biggr)^4

The variation of the electric field with radius is no longer the
simple parabola we drew in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F5">23–5</a>, but at large
radii lies slightly above the curve $(E_1+E_2)$.</p>

<div id="Ch23-S2-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">We are not quite through yet. The new electric field produces a new
correction to the magnetic field, and the newly corrected magnetic
field will produce a further correction to the electric field, and on
and on. However, we already have all the formulas that we need.
For $B_3$ we can use Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2310">23.10</a>), changing the subscripts of
$B$ and $E$ from $2$ to $3$.</p>

<p class="p">We want to look now at what our solution gives for the electric field
between the plates of the capacitor as we continue to go to higher and
higher frequencies. For large $\omega$, the parameter $x=\omega r/c$
also gets large, and the first few terms in the series for $J_0$
of $x$ will increase rapidly. That means that the parabola we have drawn
in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F5">23–5</a> curves downward more steeply at higher
frequencies. In fact, it looks as though the field would fall all the
way to zero at some high frequency, perhaps when $c/\omega$ is
approximately one-half of $a$. Let’s see whether $J_0$ does indeed go
through zero and become negative. We begin by trying $x=2$:
\begin{equation*}
J_0(2)=1-1+\tfrac{1}{4}-\tfrac{1}{36}=0.22.
\end{equation*}

The function is still not zero, so let’s try a higher value of $x$,
say, $x=2.5$. Putting in numbers, we write
\begin{equation*}
J_0(2.5)=1-1.56+0.61-0.11=-0.06.
\end{equation*}

The function $J_0$ has already gone through zero by the time we get
to $x=2.5$. Comparing the results for $x=2$ and $x=2.5$, it looks as
though $J_0$ goes through zero at one-fifth of the way from $2.5$
to $2$. We would guess that the zero occurs for $x$ approximately equal
to $2.4$. Let’s see what that value of $x$ gives:
\begin{equation*}
J_0(2.4)=1-1.44+0.52-0.08=0.00.
\end{equation*}

We get zero to the accuracy of our two decimal places. If we make the
calculation more accurate (or since $J_0$ is a well-known function, if
we look it up in a book), we find that it goes through zero
at $x=2.405$. We have worked it out by hand to show you that you too
could have discovered these things rather than having to borrow them
from a book.

in frequency, the electric field at the center of our condenser will
be one way and the electric field near the edge will point in the
opposite direction. For example, suppose that we take an $\omega$ high
enough so that $x=\omega r/c$ at the outer edge of the capacitor is
equal to $4$; then the edge of the capacitor corresponds to the
abscissa $x=4$ in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F6">23–6</a>. This means that our
capacitor is being operated at the frequency $\omega=4c/a$. At the
edge of the plates, the electric field will have a rather high
magnitude opposite the direction we would expect. That is the terrible
thing that can happen to a capacitor at high frequencies. If we go to
very high frequencies, the direction of the electric field oscillates
back and forth many times as we go out from the center of the
capacitor. Also there are the magnetic fields associated with these
electric fields. It is not surprising that our capacitor doesn’t look
like the ideal capacitance for high frequencies. We may even start to
wonder whether it looks more like a capacitor or an inductance. We
should emphasize that there are even more complicated effects that we
have neglected which happen at the edges of the capacitor. For
instance, there will be a radiation of waves out past the edges, so
the fields are even more complicated than the ones we have computed,
but we will not worry about those effects now.</p>

<p class="p">We could try to figure out an equivalent circuit for the capacitor, but
perhaps it is better if we just admit that the capacitor we have
designed for low-frequency fields is just no longer satisfactory when
the frequency is too high. If we want to treat the operation of such an
object at high frequencies, we should abandon the approximations to
Maxwell’s equations that we
have made for treating circuits and return to the complete set of
equations which describe completely the fields in space. Instead of
dealing with idealized circuit elements, we have to deal with the real
conductors as they are, taking into account all the fields in the spaces
in between. For instance, if we want a resonant circuit at high
frequencies we will not try to design one using a coil and a
parallel-plate capacitor.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We have already mentioned that the parallel-plate capacitor we have been
analyzing has some of the aspects of both a capacitor and an inductance.
With the electric field there are charges on the surfaces of the plates,
and with the magnetic fields there are back emf’s. Is it possible that
we already have a resonant circuit? We do indeed. Suppose we pick a
frequency for which the electric field pattern falls to zero at some
radius inside the edge of the disc; that is, we choose $\omega a/c$
greater than $2.405$. Everywhere on a circle coaxial with the plates the
electric field will be zero. Now suppose we take a thin metal sheet and
cut a strip just wide enough to fit between the plates of the capacitor.
Then we bend it into a cylinder that will go around at the radius where
the electric field is zero. Since there are no electric fields there,
when we put this conducting cylinder in place, no currents will flow in
it; and there will be no changes in the electric and magnetic fields. We
have been able to put a direct short circuit across the capacitor
without changing anything. And look what we have; we have a complete
cylindrical can with electrical and magnetic fields inside and no
connection at all to the outside world. The fields inside won’t change
even if we throw away the edges of the plates outside our can, and also
the capacitor leads. All we have left is a closed can with electric and
magnetic fields inside, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F7">23–7</a>(a). The
electric fields are oscillating back and forth at the
frequency $\omega$—which, don’t forget, determined the diameter of the can. The
amplitude of the oscillating $E$ field varies with the distance from the
axis of the can, as shown in the graph of Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F7">23–7</a>(b).
This curve is just the first arch of the Bessel function of zero
order. There is also a magnetic field which goes in circles around the
axis and oscillates in time $90^\circ$ out of phase with the electric
field.</p>

<p class="p">How is it that we can have an electric and magnetic field inside a can
with no external connections? It is because the electric and magnetic
fields maintain themselves, the changing $\FLPE$ makes a $\FLPB$ and
the changing $\FLPB$ makes an $\FLPE$—all according to the equations
of Maxwell.
The magnetic field has an inductive aspect, and the
electric field a capacitive aspect; together they make something like
a resonant circuit. Notice that the conditions we have described would
only happen if the radius of the can is exactly $2.405 c/\omega$. For
a can of a given radius, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields
will maintain themselves—in the way we have described—only at that
particular frequency. So a cylindrical can of radius $r$ is
<em class="emph">resonant</em> at the frequency
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:23:18}
\omega_0=2.405\,\frac{c}{r}.
\end{equation}

<div id="Ch23-S3-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">We have said that the fields continue to oscillate in the same way after
the can is completely closed. That is not exactly right. It would be
possible if the walls of the can were perfect conductors. For a real
can, however, the oscillating currents which exist on the inside walls
of the can lose energy because of the resistance of the material. The
oscillations of the fields will gradually die away. We can see from
Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F7">23–7</a> that there must be strong currents associated
with electric and magnetic fields inside the cavity. Because the
vertical electrical field stops suddenly at the top and bottom plates of
the can, it has a large divergence there; so there must be positive and
negative electric charges on the inner surfaces of the can, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F7">23–7</a>(a). When the electric field reverses, the charges
must reverse also, so there must be an alternating current between the
top and bottom plates of the can. These charges will flow in the sides
of the can, as shown in the figure. We can also see that there must be
currents in the sides of the can by considering what happens to the
magnetic field. The graph of Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F7">23–7</a>(c) tells us that the
magnetic field suddenly drops to zero at the edge of the can. Such a
sudden change in the magnetic field can happen only if there is a
current in the wall. This current is what gives the alternating electric
charges on the top and bottom plates of the can.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch23-S3-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">You may be wondering about our discovery of currents in the vertical
sides of the can. What about our earlier statement that nothing would
be changed when we introduced these vertical sides in a region where
the electric field was zero? Remember, however, that when we first put
in the sides of the can, the top and bottom plates extended out beyond
them, so that there were also magnetic fields on the outside of our
can. It was only when we threw away the parts of the capacitor plates
beyond the edges of the can that net currents had to appear on the
insides of the vertical walls.</p>

<p class="p">Although the electric and magnetic fields in the completely enclosed
can will gradually die away because of the energy losses, we can stop
this from happening if we make a little hole in the can and put in a
little bit of electrical energy to make up the losses. We take a small
wire, poke it through the hole in the side of the can, and fasten it
to the inside wall so that it makes a small loop, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F8">23–8</a>. If we now connect this wire to a source of
high-frequency alternating current, this current will couple energy into
the electric and magnetic fields of the cavity and keep the oscillations
going. This will happen, of course, only if the frequency of the driving
source is at the resonant frequency of the can. If the source is at the
wrong frequency, the electric and magnetic fields will not resonate, and
the fields in the can will be very weak.</p>

<p class="p">The resonant behavior can easily be seen by making another small hole
in the can and hooking in another coupling loop, as we have also drawn
in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F8">23–8</a>. The changing magnetic field through this loop will
generate an induced electromotive force in the loop. If this loop is
now connected to some external measuring circuit, the currents will be
proportional to the strength of the fields in the cavity. Suppose we
now connect the input loop of our cavity to an RF signal generator, as
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F9">23–9</a>. The signal generator contains a source of
alternating current whose frequency can be varied by varying the knob
on the front of the generator. Then we connect the output loop of the
cavity to a “detector,” which is an instrument that measures the
current from the output loop. It gives a meter reading proportional to
this current. If we now measure the output current as a function of
the frequency of the signal generator, we find a curve like that shown
in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F10">23–10</a>. The output current is small for all frequencies
except those very near the frequency $\omega_0$, which is the resonant
frequency of the cavity. The resonance curve is very much like those
we described in Chapter <a href="I_23.html">23</a> of Vol. I. The width of the
resonance is however, much narrower than we usually find for resonant
circuits made of inductances and capacitors; that is, the $Q$ of the
cavity is very high. It is not unusual to find $Q$’s as high
as $100{,}000$ or more if the inside walls of the cavity are made of some
material with a very good conductivity, such as silver.</p>

actual can. We take a can which is a cylinder with a diameter of
$3.0$ inches and a height of about $2.5$ inches. The can is fitted with
an input and output loop, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F8">23–8</a>. If we
calculate the resonant frequency expected for this can according to
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2318">23.18</a>), we get that
$f_0=$ $\omega_0/2\pi=$ $3010$ megacycles. When we set the frequency of our
signal generator near $3000$ megacycles and vary it slightly until we
find the resonance, we observe that the maximum output current occurs
for a frequency of $3050$ megacycles, which is quite close to the
predicted resonant frequency, but not exactly the same. There are
several possible reasons for the discrepancy. Perhaps the resonant
frequency is changed a little bit because of the holes we have cut to
put in the coupling loops. A little thought, however, shows that the
holes should lower the resonant frequency a little bit, so that cannot
be the reason. Perhaps there is some slight error in the frequency
calibration of the signal generator, or perhaps our measurement of the
diameter of the cavity is not accurate enough. Anyway, the agreement is
fairly close.</p>

<p class="p">Much more important is something that happens if we vary the frequency
of our signal generator somewhat further from $3000$ megacycles. When we
do that we get the results shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F11">23–11</a>. We find
that, in addition to the resonance we expected near $3000$ megacycles,
there is also a resonance near $3300$ megacycles and one near
$3820$ megacycles. What do these extra resonances mean? We might get a
clue from Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F6">23–6</a>. Although we have been assuming that
the first zero of the Bessel function occurs at
the edge of the can, it could also be that the second zero of the Bessel
function corresponds to the edge of the can, so
that there is one complete oscillation of the electric field as we move
from the center of the can out to the edge, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F12">23–12</a>. This is another possible mode for the
oscillating fields. We should certainly expect the can to resonate in
such a mode. But notice, the second zero of the Bessel
function occurs at $x=5.52$, which is over twice
as large as the value at the first zero. The resonant frequency of this
mode should therefore be higher than $6000$ megacycles. We would, no
doubt, find it there, but it doesn’t explain the resonance we observe
at $3300$.</p>

cavity we have considered only one possible geometric arrangement of
the electric and magnetic fields. We have assumed that the electric
fields are vertical and that the magnetic fields lie in horizontal
circles. But other fields are possible. The only requirements are that
the fields should satisfy Maxwell’s
equations inside the can and that the
electric field should meet the wall at right angles. We have considered
the case in which the top and the bottom of the can are flat, but things
would not be completely different if the top and bottom were curved. In
fact, how is the can supposed to know which is its top and bottom, and
which are its sides? It is, in fact, possible to show that there is a
mode of oscillation of the fields inside the can in which the electric
fields go more or less across the diameter of the can, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F13">23–13</a>.

mode should be not very different from the natural frequency of the
first mode we have considered. Suppose that instead of our cylindrical
cavity we had taken a cavity which was a cube $3$ inches on a side. It
is clear that this cavity would have three different modes, but all
with the same frequency. A mode with the electric field going more or
less up and down would certainly have the same frequency as the mode
in which the electric field was directed right and left. If we now
distort the cube into a cylinder, we will change these frequencies
somewhat. We would still expect them not to be changed too much,
provided we keep the dimensions of the cavity more or less the same. So
the frequency of the mode of Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F13">23–13</a> should not be too
different from the mode of Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F8">23–8</a>. We could make a
detailed calculation of the natural frequency of the mode shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F13">23–13</a>, but we will not do that now. When the
calculations are carried through, it is found that, for the dimensions
we have assumed, the resonant frequency comes out very close to the

the electric and magnetic fields. Each of these field arrangements is
called a resonant <em class="emph">mode</em>. The resonance
frequency of each mode can be calculated by solving Maxwell’s

<p class="p">Although the resonant cavity we have been describing seems to be quite
different from the ordinary resonant circuit consisting of an inductance
and a capacitor, the two resonant systems are, of course, closely
related. They are both members of the same family; they are just two
extreme cases of electromagnetic resonators—and there are many
intermediate cases between these two extremes. Suppose we start by
considering the resonant circuit of a capacitor in parallel with an
inductance, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F16">23–16</a>(a). This circuit will
resonate at the frequency $\omega_0=1/\sqrt{LC}$. If we want to raise
the resonant frequency of this circuit, we can do so by lowering the
inductance $L$. One way is to decrease the number of turns in the coil.
We can, however, go only so far in this direction. Eventually we will
get down to the last turn, and we will have just a piece of wire joining
the top and bottom plates of the condenser. We could raise the resonant
frequency still further by making the capacitance smaller; however, we
can also continue to decrease the inductance by putting several
inductances in parallel. Two one-turn inductances in parallel will have
only half the inductance of each turn. So when our inductance has been
reduced to a single turn, we can continue to raise the resonant
frequency by adding other single loops from the top plate to the bottom
plate of the condenser. For instance, Fig. <a href="#Ch23-F16">23–16</a>(b) shows
the condenser plates connected by six such “single-turn inductances.”
If we continue to add many such pieces of wire, we can make the
transition to the completely enclosed resonant system shown in part (c)
of the figure, which is a drawing of the cross section of a
cylindrically symmetrical object. Our inductance is now a cylindrical
hollow can attached to the edges of the condenser plates. The electric
and magnetic fields will be as shown in the figure. Such an object is,
of course, a resonant cavity. It is called a “loaded” cavity. But we
can still think of it as an $L$-$C$ circuit in which the capacity
section is the region where we find most of the electric field and the
inductance section is that region where we find most of the magnetic
field.</p>

dimensions of the inductance section, for example by decreasing the
dimension $h$ in the drawing. As $h$ is decreased, the resonant
frequency will be increased. Eventually, of course, we will get to the
situation in which the height $h$ is just equal to the separation
