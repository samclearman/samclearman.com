		This book is based upon a course of lectures in introductory physics given by
        Prof. R. P. Feynman at the California Institute of Technology during the academic
        year 1961&ndash;62; it covers the first year of the two-year introductory course taken
        by all Caltech freshmen and sophomores, and was followed in 1962&ndash;63 by a similar
        series covering the second year. The lectures constitute a major part of a
        fundamental revision of the introductory course, carried out over a four-year
        period.</p>
        </div>        
        <div id="Ch92-S1-p2" class="para">
		<p class="p">
        The need for a basic revision arose both from the rapid development of physics in
        recent decades and from the fact that entering freshmen have shown a steady
        increase in mathematical ability as a result of improvements in high school
        mathematics course content. We hoped to take advantage of this improved
        mathematical background, and also to introduce enough modern subject matter to
        make the course challenging, interesting, and more representative of present-day
        physics.</p>

        In order to generate a variety of ideas on what material to include and how to
        present it, a substantial number of the physics faculty were encouraged to offer
        their ideas in the form of topical outlines for a revised course. Several of
        these were presented and were thoroughly and critically discussed. It was agreed
        almost at once that a basic revision of the course could not be accomplished
        either by merely adopting a different textbook, or even by writing one <i>ab
        initio</i>, but that the new course should be centered about a set of lectures,
        to be presented at the rate of two or three per week; the appropriate text
        material would then be produced as a secondary operation as the course developed,
        and suitable laboratory experiments would also be arranged to fit the lecture
        material. Accordingly, a rough outline of the course was established, but this
        was recognized as being incomplete, tentative, and subject to considerable
        modification by whoever was to bear the responsibility for actually preparing the
        lectures.</p>
        </div>        
        <div id="Ch92-S1-p4" class="para">
		<p class="p">
        Concerning the mechanism by which the course would finally be brought to life,
        several plans were considered. These plans were mostly rather similar, involving
        a cooperative effort by <i>N</i> staff members who would share the total burden
        symmetrically and equally: each man would take responsibility for <i>1/N</i> of
        the material, deliver the lectures, and write text material for his part.
        However, the unavailability of sufficient staff, and the difficulty of
        maintaining a uniform point of view because of differences in personality and
        philosophy of individual participants, made such plans seem unworkable.</p>
        </div>        
        <div id="Ch92-S1-p5" class="para">
		<p class="p">
        The realization that we actually possessed the means to create not just a new and
        different physics course, but possibly a unique one, came as a happy inspiration
        to Professor Sands. He suggested that Professor R. P. Feynman prepare and deliver
        the lectures, and that these be tape-recorded. When transcribed and edited, they
        would then become the textbook for the new course. This is essentially the plan
        that was adopted.</p>
        </div>        
        <div id="Ch92-S1-p6" class="para">
		<p class="p">
        It was expected that the necessary editing would be minor, mainly consisting of
        supplying figures, and checking punctuation and grammar; it was to be done by one
        or two graduate students on a part-time basis. Unfortunately, this expectation
        was short-lived. It was, in fact, a major editorial operation to transform the
        verbatim transcript into readable form, even without the reorganization or
        revision of the subject matter that was sometimes required. Furthermore, it was
        not a job for a technical editor or for a graduate student, but one that required
        the close attention of a professional physicist for from ten to twenty hours per
        lecture!</p>
        </div>        
        <div id="Ch92-S1-p7" class="para">
		<p class="p">
        The difficulty of the editorial task, together with the need to place the
        material in the hands of the students as soon as possible, set a strict limit
        upon the amount of “polishing” of the material that could be accomplished, and
        thus we were forced to aim toward a preliminary but technically correct product
        that could be used immediately, rather than one that might be considered final or
        finished. Because of an urgent need for more copies for our students, and a
        heartening interest on the part of instructors and students at several other
        institutions, we decided to publish the material in its preliminary form rather
        than wait for a further major revision which might never occur. We have no
        illusions as to the completeness, smoothness, or logical organization of the
        material; in fact, we plan several minor modifications in the course in the
        immediate future, and we hope that it will not become static in form or
        content.</p>

        <div id="Ch92-S1-p8" class="para">

        In addition to the lectures, which constitute a centrally important part of the
        course, it was necessary also to provide suitable exercises to develop the
        students’ experience and ability, and suitable experiments to provide first-hand
        contact with the lecture material in the laboratory. Neither of these aspects is
        in as advanced a state as the lecture material, but considerable progress has
        been made. Some exercises were made up as the lectures progressed, and these were
        expanded and amplified for use in the following year. However, because we are not
        yet satisfied that the exercises provide sufficient variety and depth of
        application of the lecture material to make the student fully aware of the
        tremendous power being placed at his disposal, the exercises are published
        separately in a less permanent form in order to encourage frequent
        revision.</p>

        A number of new experiments for the new course have been devised by Professor H.
        V. Neher. Among these are several which utilize the extremely low friction
        exhibited by a gas bearing: a novel linear air trough, with which quantitative
        measurements of one-dimensional motion, impacts, and harmonic motion can be made,
        and an air-supported, air-driven Maxwell top, with which accelerated rotational
        motion and gyroscopic precession and nutation can be studied. The development of
        new laboratory experiments is expected to continue for a considerable period of
        time.</p>
