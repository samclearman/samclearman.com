<div id="Ch4-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In the last chapter we began to consider the special rules for the
interference that occurs in processes with two <em class="emph">identical</em>
particles. By <em class="emph">identical particles</em> we mean things like electrons
which can in no way be distinguished one from another. If a process
involves two particles that are identical, reversing which one arrives
at a counter is an alternative which cannot be distinguished
and—like all cases of alternatives which cannot be
distinguished—interferes with the original, unexchanged case. The
amplitude for an event is then the sum of the two interfering
amplitudes; but, interestingly enough, the interference is in some
cases with the <em class="emph">same</em> phase and, in others, with the
<em class="emph">opposite</em> phase.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch4-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose we have a collision of two particles $a$ and $b$ in which
particle $a$ scatters in the direction $1$ and particle $b$ scatters
in the direction $2$, as sketched in Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F1">4–1</a>(a). Let’s
call $f(\theta)$ the amplitude for this process; then the probability $P_1$
of observing such an event is proportional to $\abs{f(\theta)}^2$. Of
course, it could also happen that particle $b$ scattered into counter $1$
and particle $a$ went into counter $2$, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F1">4–1</a>(b). Assuming that there are no special directions
defined by spins or such, the probability $P_2$ for this process is
just $\abs{f(\pi-\theta)}^2$, because it is just equivalent to the first
process with counter $1$ moved over to the angle $\pi-\theta$. You might
also think that the <em class="emph">amplitude</em> for the second process is
just $f(\pi-\theta)$. But that is not necessarily so, because there could be
an arbitrary phase factor. That is, the amplitude could be
\begin{equation*}
e^{i\delta}f(\pi-\theta).
\end{equation*}

Such an amplitude still gives a probability $P_2$ equal
to $\abs{f(\pi-\theta)}^2$.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch4-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let’s see what happens if $a$ and $b$ are identical
particles. Then the two different processes shown in the two diagrams
of Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F1">4–1</a> cannot be distinguished. There is an amplitude that
<em class="emph">either</em> $a$ or $b$ goes into counter $1$, while the other goes
into counter $2$. This amplitude is the sum of the amplitudes for the
two processes shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F1">4–1</a>. If we call the first
one $f(\theta)$, then the second one is $e^{i\delta}f(\pi-\theta)$, where
now the phase factor is very important because we are going to be
adding two amplitudes. Suppose we have to multiply the amplitude by a
certain phase factor when we exchange the roles of the two
particles. If we exchange them again we should get the same factor
again. But we are then back to the first process. The phase factor
taken twice must bring us back where we started—its square must be
equal to $1$. There are only two possibilities: $e^{i\delta}$ is equal
to $+1$, or is equal to $-1$. Either the exchanged case contributes
with the <em class="emph">same</em> sign, or it contributes with the <em class="emph">opposite</em>
sign. Both cases exist in nature, each for a different class of
particles. Particles which interfere with a <em class="emph">positive</em> sign are
called <em class="emph">Bose particles</em> and those which interfere with a
<em class="emph">negative</em> sign are called <em class="emph">Fermi particles</em>. The Bose
particles are the photon, the mesons, and the graviton. The Fermi
particles are the electron, the muon, the neutrinos, the nucleons, and
the baryons. We have, then, that the amplitude for the scattering of
identical particles is:<br><br>
<i>&emsp;&emsp;Bose particles:</i>
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:1}
(\text{Amplitude direct})+(\text{Amplitude exchanged}).

<p class="p">Now an interesting problem arises when there are two or more particles
bound tightly together. For example, an $\alpha$-particle has four
particles in it—two neutrons and two protons. When two
$\alpha$-particles scatter, there are several possibilities. It may be
that during the scattering there is a certain amplitude that one of
the neutrons will leap across from one $\alpha$-particle to the other,
while a neutron from the other $\alpha$-particle leaps the other way
so that the two alphas which come out of the scattering are not the
original ones—there has been an exchange of a pair of neutrons. See
Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F2">4–2</a>. The amplitude for scattering with an exchange of a pair of
neutrons will interfere with the amplitude for scattering with no such
exchange, and the interference must be with a minus sign because there
has been an exchange of one pair of Fermi particles. On the other
hand, if the relative energy of the two $\alpha$-particles is so low
that they stay fairly far apart—say, due to the Coulomb
repulsion—and there is never any appreciable probability of
exchanging any of the internal particles, we can consider the
$\alpha$-particle as a simple object, and we do not need to worry
about its internal details. In such circumstances, there are only two
contributions to the scattering amplitude. Either there is no
exchange, or all four of the nucleons are exchanged in the
scattering. Since the protons and the neutrons in the
$\alpha$-particle are all Fermi particles, an exchange of any pair
reverses the sign of the scattering amplitude. So long as there are no
internal changes in the $\alpha$-particles, interchanging the two
$\alpha$-particles is the same as interchanging four pairs of Fermi
particles. There is a change in sign for each pair, so the net result
is that the amplitudes combine with a positive sign. The
$\alpha$-particle behaves like a Bose particle.</p>

<div id="Ch4-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">So the rule is that composite objects, in circumstances in which the
composite object can be considered as a single object, behave like

<div id="Ch4-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">All the elementary Fermi particles we have mentioned—such as the
electron, the proton, the neutron, and so on—have a spin $j=1/2$. If
several such Fermi particles are put together to form a composite
object, the resulting spin may be either integral or
half-integral. For example, the common isotope of helium, He$^4$,
which has two neutrons and two protons, has a spin of zero, whereas
Li$^7$, which has three protons and four neutrons, has a spin
of $3/2$. We will learn later the rules for compounding angular momentum,
and will just mention now that every composite object which has a

minus sign, whereas particles with integral spin are Bose particles
whose amplitudes add with the positive sign? We apologize for the fact
that we cannot give you an elementary explanation. An explanation has
been worked out by
Pauli
from complicated arguments of quantum field
theory and relativity. He has shown that the two must necessarily go
together, but we have not been able to find a way of reproducing his
arguments on an elementary level. It appears to be one of the few
places in physics where there is a rule which can be stated very
simply, but for which no one has found a simple and easy
explanation. The explanation is deep down in relativistic quantum
mechanics. This probably means that we do not have a complete
understanding of the fundamental principle involved. For the moment,
you will just have to take it as one of the rules of the world.</p>

<p class="p">Now we would like to discuss an interesting consequence of the
addition rule for Bose particles. It has to do with their behavior
when there are several particles present. We begin by considering a
situation in which two Bose particles are scattered from two different
scatterers. We won’t worry about the details of the scattering
mechanism. We are interested only in what happens to the scattered
particles. Suppose we have the situation shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F3">4–3</a>. The
particle $a$ is scattered into the state $1$. By a <em class="emph">state</em> we
mean a given direction and energy, or some other given condition. The
particle $b$ is scattered into the state $2$. We want to assume that
the two states $1$ and $2$ are nearly the same. (What we really want
to find out eventually is the amplitude that the two particles are
scattered into identical directions, or states; but it is best if we
think first about what happens if the states are almost the same and
then work out what happens when they become identical.)</p>

amplitude for the two scatterings to occur at the same time is just

<div id="Ch4-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Although we have been considering that the two particles are observed
in separate counters, this is not essential—as we can see in the
following way. Let’s imagine that both the directions $1$ and $2$
would bring the particles into a <em class="emph">single</em> small counter which is
some distance away. We will let the direction $1$ be defined by saying
that it heads toward the element of area $dS_1$ of the
counter. Direction $2$ heads toward the surface element $dS_2$ of the
counter. (We imagine that the counter presents a surface at right
angles to the line from the scatterings.) Now we cannot give a
probability that a particle will go into a precise direction or to a
<em class="emph">particular</em> point in space. Such a thing is impossible—the
chance for any exact direction is zero. When we want to be so
specific, we shall have to define our amplitudes so that they give the
probability of arriving <em class="emph">per unit area</em> of a counter. Suppose
that we had only particle $a$; it would have a certain amplitude for
scattering in direction $1$. Let’s define $\braket{1}{a}=a_1$ to be
the amplitude that $a$ will scatter <em class="emph">into a unit</em> area of the
counter in the direction $1$. In other words, the scale of $a_1$ is
chosen—we say it is “normalized” so that the probability that it
will scatter <em class="emph">into an element of area</em> $dS_1$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:7}
\abs{\braket{1}{a}}^2\,dS_1=\abs{a_1}^2\,dS_1.
\end{equation}

If our counter has the total area $\Delta S$, and we let $dS_1$ range
over this area, the total probability that the particle $a$ will be
scattered into the counter is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:8}
\int_{\Delta S}\abs{a_1}^2\,dS_1.

<div id="Ch4-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">As before, we want to assume that the counter is sufficiently small so
that the amplitude $a_1$ doesn’t vary significantly over the surface

into the counter is

p_a=\abs{a}^2\,\Delta S.

particle $b$—when it is alone—scatters into some element of area,

\end{equation*}

(We use $dS_2$ instead of $dS_1$ because we will later want $a$
and $b$ to go into different directions.) Again we set $b_2$ equal to the
constant amplitude $b$; then the probability that particle $b$ is
counted in the detector is

p_b=\abs{b}^2\,\Delta S.

that
\begin{equation}

P_2=\abs{a}^2\abs{b}^2\,(\Delta S)^2.

<div id="Ch4-S2-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">When the two particles are identical, however, there are two

going into $dS_1$ is indistinguishable from $a$ into $dS_1$ and $b$
into $dS_2$, so the amplitudes for these processes will
interfere. (When we had two <em class="emph">different</em> particles
above—although we did not <em class="emph">in fact</em> care which particle went
where in the counter—we could, <em class="emph">in principle</em>, have found out;
so there was no interference. For identical particles we cannot tell,
even in principle.) We must write, then, that the probability that the
two particles arrive at $dS_1$ and $dS_2$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:13}
\abs{a_1b_2+a_2b_1}^2\,dS_1\,dS_2.

Now, however, when we integrate over the area of the counter, we must
be careful. If we let $dS_1$ and $dS_2$ range over the whole
area $\Delta S$, we would count each part of the area <em class="emph">twice</em>

Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F4">4–4</a>; we can consider merely that there are some atoms
emitting $n$ photons, as in Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F5">4–5</a>. So our result can
also be stated: <em class="emph">The probability that an atom will emit a photon
into a particular final state is increased by the factor $(n+1)$ if
there are already $n$ photons in that state</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch4-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">People like to summarize this result by saying that the
<em class="emph">amplitude</em> to emit a photon is increased by the
factor $\sqrt{n+1}$ when there are already $n$ photons present. It is, of
course, another way of saying the same thing if it is understood to
mean that this amplitude is just to be squared to get the probability.</p>

<p class="p">It is generally true in quantum mechanics that the amplitude to get

\braket{\chi}{\phi}=\braket{\phi}{\chi}\cconj.

We will learn about this law a little later, but for the moment we
will just assume it is true. We can use it to find out how photons are
scattered or absorbed <em class="emph">out</em> of a given state. We have that the
amplitude that a photon will be added to some state, say $i$, when
there are already $n$ photons present is, say,
\begin{equation}

\braket{n+1}{n}=\sqrt{n+1}\,a,

\begin{equation}

they have trouble trying to remember when to use $\sqrt{n}$

before or after the reaction. Equations (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII425">4.25</a>)

<div id="Ch4-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">There are many physical consequences of these new rules; we want to
describe one of them having to do with the emission of light. Suppose
we imagine a situation in which photons are contained in a box—you
can imagine a box with mirrors for walls. Now say that in the box we
have $n$ photons, all of the same state—the same frequency,
direction, and polarization—so they can’t be distinguished, and that
also there is an atom in the box that can emit another photon into the
same state. Then the probability that it will emit a photon is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:28}
(n+1)\abs{a}^2,
\end{equation}

and the probability that it will absorb a photon is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:29}
n\abs{a}^2,
\end{equation}

where $\abs{a}^2$ is the probability it would emit if no photons were
present. We have already discussed these rules in a somewhat different
way in Chapter <a href="I_42.html">42</a> of Vol. I.
Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII429">4.29</a>) says that the probability that an atom will
<em class="emph">absorb</em> a photon and make a transition to a higher energy state is
proportional to the intensity of the light shining on it. But, as
Einstein first pointed out,
the rate at which an atom will make a
transition <em class="emph">downward</em> has two parts. There is the probability that
it will make a spontaneous transition $\abs{a}^2$, plus the probability
of an induced transition $n\abs{a}^2$, which is proportional to the
intensity of the light—that is, to the number of photons present.
Furthermore, as Einstein said,
the coefficients of absorption and of
induced emission are equal and are related to the probability of
spontaneous emission. What we learn here is that if the light intensity
is measured in terms of the number of photons present (instead of as the
energy per unit area, and per sec), the coefficients of absorption of
induced emission and of spontaneous emission are all equal. This is the
content of the relation between the Einstein coefficients $A$

<p class="p">We would like to use our rules for Bose particles to discuss once more
the spectrum of blackbody radiation (see Chapter <a href="I_42.html">42</a>,
Vol. I). We will do it by finding out how many photons there are in a
box if the radiation is in thermal equilibrium with some atoms in the
box. Suppose that for each light frequency $\omega$, there are a certain
number $N$ of atoms which have two energy states separated by the
energy $\Delta E=\hbar\omega$. See Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F6">4–6</a>. We’ll call the
lower-energy state the “ground” state and the upper state the
“excited” state. Let $N_g$ and $N_e$ be the average numbers of atoms
in the ground and excited states; then in thermal equilibrium at the
temperature $T$, we have from statistical mechanics that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:30}
\frac{N_e}{N_g}=e^{-\Delta E/kT}=e^{-\hbar\omega/kT}.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch4-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Each atom in the ground state can absorb a photon and go into the
excited state, and each atom in the excited state can emit a photon
and go to the ground state. In equilibrium, the rates for these two
processes must be equal. The rates are proportional to the probability
for the event and to the number of atoms present. Let’s let $\overline{n}$
be the average number of photons present in a given state with the
frequency $\omega$. Then the absorption rate from that state
is $N_g\overline{n}\abs{a}^2$, and the emission rate into that state
is $N_e(\overline{n}+1)\abs{a}^2$. Setting the two rates equal, we have that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:31}
N_g\overline{n}=N_e(\overline{n}+1).

Combining this with Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII430">4.30</a>), we have

\overline{n}=\frac{1}{e^{\hbar\omega/kT}-1},

which is the mean number of photons in any state with
frequency $\omega$, for a cavity in thermal equilibrium. Since each photon has
the energy $\hbar\omega$, the energy in the photons of a given state
is $\overline{n}\hbar\omega$, or

[Chapter <a href="I_41.html">41</a>, Vol. I, Eq. (<a href="I_41.html#mjx-eqn-EqI4115">41.15</a>)]. You
remember that for any harmonic oscillator—such as a weight on a
spring—the quantum mechanical energy levels are equally spaced with a
separation $\hbar\omega$, as drawn in Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F7">4–7</a>. If we call
the energy of the $n$th level $n\hbar\omega$, we find that the mean
energy of such an oscillator is also given by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII433">4.33</a>).
Yet this equation was derived here for photons, by counting particles,
and it gives the same results. That is one of the marvelous miracles of
quantum mechanics. If one begins by considering a kind of state or
condition for Bose particles which do not interact with each other (we
have assumed that the photons do not interact with each other), and then
considers that into this state there can be put either zero, or one, or
two, … up to any number $n$ of particles, one finds that this
system behaves for all quantum mechanical purposes exactly like a
harmonic oscillator. By such an oscillator we mean a dynamic system like
a weight on a spring or a standing wave in a resonant cavity. And that
is why it is possible to represent the electromagnetic field by photon
particles. From one point of view, we can analyze the electromagnetic
field in a box or cavity in terms of a lot of harmonic oscillators,
treating each mode of oscillation according to quantum mechanics as a
harmonic oscillator. From a different point of view, we can analyze the
same physics in terms of identical Bose particles. And the results of
both ways of working <em class="emph">are always in exact agreement</em>. There is no
way to make up your mind whether the electromagnetic field is really to
be described as a quantized harmonic oscillator or by giving how many
photons there are in each condition. The two views turn out to be
mathematically identical. So in the future we can speak either about the
number of photons in a particular state in a box or the number of the
energy level associated with a particular mode of oscillation of the
electromagnetic field. They are two ways of saying the same thing. The
same is true of photons in free space. They are equivalent to
oscillations of a cavity whose walls have receded to infinity.

<p class="p">We have computed the mean energy in any particular mode in a box at
the temperature $T$; we need only one more thing to get the blackbody
radiation law: We need to know how many modes there are at each
energy. (We assume that for every mode there are some atoms in the
box—or in the walls—which have energy levels that can radiate into
that mode, so that each mode can get into thermal equilibrium.) The
blackbody radiation law is usually stated by giving the energy per
unit volume carried by the light in a small frequency interval from
$\omega$ to $\omega+\Delta\omega$. So we need to know how many modes
there are in a box with frequencies in the

<div id="Ch4-S5-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We will get the answer only for a rectangular box. It comes out the
same for a box of any shape, but it’s very complicated to compute for
the arbitrary case. Also, we are only interested in a box whose
dimensions are very large compared with a wavelength of the
light. Then there are billions and billions of modes; there will be
many in any small frequency interval $\Delta\omega$, so we can speak
of the “average number” in any $\Delta\omega$ at the
frequency $\omega$. Let’s start by asking how many modes there are in a
one-dimensional case—as for waves on a stretched string. You know
that each mode is a sine wave that has to go to zero at both ends; in
other words, there must be an integral number of half-wavelengths in
the length of the line, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F8">4–8</a>. We prefer
to use the wave number $k=2\pi/\lambda$; calling $k_j$ the wave number
of the $j$th mode, we have that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:34}
k_j=\frac{j\pi}{L},
\end{equation}

where $j$ is any integer. The separation $\delta k$ between successive
modes is
\begin{equation*}
\delta k=k_{j+1}-k_j=\frac{\pi}{L}.
\end{equation*}

We want to assume that $kL$ is so large that in a small
interval $\Delta k$, there are many modes. Calling $\Delta\numModes$ the number
of modes in the interval $\Delta k$, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:35}
\Delta\numModes=\frac{\Delta k}{\delta k}=\frac{L}{\pi}\,\Delta k.

<div id="Ch4-S5-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Now theoretical physicists working in quantum mechanics usually prefer
to say that there are one-half as many modes; they write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:36}
\Delta\numModes=\frac{L}{2\pi}\,\Delta k.
\end{equation}

We would like to explain why. They usually like to think in terms of
travelling waves—some going to the right (with a positive $k$) and
some going to the left (with a negative $k$). But a “mode” is a
<em class="emph">standing</em> wave which is the sum of two waves, one going in each
direction. In other words, they consider each standing wave as
containing two distinct photon “states.” So if by $\Delta\numModes$,
one prefers to mean the number of photon states of a given $k$ (where
now $k$ ranges over positive and negative values), one should then
take $\Delta\numModes$ half as big. (All integrals must now go from
$k=-\infty$ to $k=+\infty$, and the total number of states up to any
given absolute value of $k$ will come out O.K.) Of course, we are
not then describing standing waves very well, but we are counting
modes in a consistent way.</p>

<p class="p">Now we want to extend the results to three dimensions. A standing wave
in a rectangular box must have an integral number of half-waves
<em class="emph">along each axis</em>. The situation for two of the dimensions is
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F9">4–9</a>. Each wave direction and frequency is
described by a vector wave number $\FLPk$, whose $x$, $y$, and $z$
components must satisfy equations like Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII434">4.34</a>). So we
have that
\begin{align*}
k_x&=\frac{j_x\pi}{L_x},\\[.5ex]
k_y&=\frac{j_y\pi}{L_y},\\[.5ex]
k_z&=\frac{j_z\pi}{L_z}.
\end{align*}

The number of modes with $k_x$ in an interval $\Delta k_x$ is, as
before,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{L_x}{2\pi}\,\Delta k_x,
\end{equation*}

and similarly for $\Delta k_y$ and $\Delta k_z$. If we
call $\Delta\numModes(\FLPk)$ the number of modes for a vector wave
number $\FLPk$ whose $x$-component is between $k_x$ and $k_x+\Delta k_x$,
whose $y$-component is between $k_y$ and $k_y+\Delta k_y$, and whose
$z$-component is between $k_z$ and $k_z+\Delta k_z$, then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:37}
\Delta\numModes(\FLPk)=\frac{L_xL_yL_z}{(2\pi)^3}\,
\Delta k_x\,\Delta k_y\,\Delta k_z.
\end{equation}

The product $L_xL_yL_z$ is equal to the volume $V$ of the box. So we
have the important result that for high frequencies (wavelengths small
compared with the dimensions), the number of modes in a cavity is
proportional to the volume $V$ of the box and to the “volume in
$k$-space” $\Delta k_x\,\Delta k_y\,\Delta k_z$. This result comes up
again and again in many problems and should be memorized:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:38}
d\numModes(\FLPk)=V\,\frac{d^3\FLPk}{(2\pi)^3}.
\end{equation}

Although we have not proved it, the result is independent of the shape
of the box.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch4-S5-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">We will now apply this result to find the number of photon modes for
photons with frequencies in the range $\Delta\omega$. We are just
interested in the energy in various modes—but not interested in the
directions of the waves. We would like to know the number of modes in
a given range of frequencies. In a vacuum the magnitude of $\FLPk$ is
related to the frequency by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:39}
\abs{\FLPk}=\frac{\omega}{c}.
\end{equation}

So in a frequency interval $\Delta\omega$, these are all the modes
which correspond to $\FLPk$’s with a <em class="emph">magnitude</em> between $k$
and $k+\Delta k$, independent of the direction. The “volume in
$k$-space” between $k$ and $k+\Delta k$ is a spherical shell of
volume
\begin{equation*}
4\pi k^2\,\Delta k.
\end{equation*}

The number of modes is then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:40}
\Delta\numModes(\omega)=\frac{V4\pi k^2\,\Delta k}{(2\pi)^3}.
\end{equation}

However, since we are now interested in frequencies, we should
substitute $k=\omega/c$, so we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:41}
\Delta\numModes(\omega)=\frac{V4\pi\omega^2\,\Delta \omega}{(2\pi)^3c^3}.
\end{equation}

<div id="Ch4-S5-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">There is one more complication. If we are talking about modes of an
electromagnetic wave, for any given wave vector $\FLPk$ there can be
either of two polarizations (at right angles to each other). Since
these modes are independent, we must—for light—double the number
of modes. So we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:42}
\Delta\numModes(\omega)=\frac{V\omega^2\,\Delta \omega}{\pi^2c^3}
\quad(\text{for light}).
\end{equation}

We have shown, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII433">4.33</a>), that each mode (or each
“state”) has on the average the energy
\begin{equation*}
\overline{n}\hbar\omega=\frac{\hbar\omega}{e^{\hbar\omega/kT}-1}.
\end{equation*}

Multiplying this by the number of modes, we get the energy $\Delta E$
in the modes that lie in the interval $\Delta\omega$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:43}
\Delta E=\frac{\hbar\omega}{e^{\hbar\omega/kT}-1}\,
\frac{V\omega^2\,\Delta \omega}{\pi^2c^3}.

This is the law for the frequency spectrum of blackbody radiation, which
we have already found in Chapter <a href="I_41.html">41</a> of Vol. I. The
spectrum is plotted in Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F10">4–10</a>. You see now that the
answer depends on the fact that photons are Bose particles, which have a
tendency to try to get all into the same state (because the amplitude
for doing so is large). You will remember, it was
Planck’s study of the
blackbody spectrum (which was a mystery to classical physics), and his
discovery of the formula in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII443">4.43</a>) that started the

<span class="tag">4–6</span>Liquid helium</h3>
<div id="Ch4-S6-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Liquid helium has at low temperatures many odd properties which we
cannot unfortunately take the time to describe in detail right now,
but many of them arise from the fact that a helium atom is a Bose
particle. One of the things is that liquid helium flows without any
viscous resistance. It is, in fact, the ideal “dry” water we have
been talking about in one of the earlier chapters—provided that the
velocities are low enough. The reason is the following. In order for a
liquid to have viscosity, there must be internal energy losses; there
must be some way for one part of the liquid to have a motion that is
different from that of the rest of the liquid. This means that it must
be possible to knock some of the atoms into states that are different
from the states occupied by other atoms. But at sufficiently low
temperatures, when the thermal motions get very small, all the atoms
try to get into the same condition. So, if some of them are moving
along, then all the atoms try to move together in the same
state. There is a kind of rigidity to the motion, and it is hard to
break the motion up into irregular patterns of turbulence, as would
happen, for example, with independent particles. So in a liquid of
Bose particles, there is a strong tendency for all the atoms to go
into the same state—which is represented by the $\sqrt{n+1}$ factor
we found earlier. (For a bottle of liquid helium $n$ is, of course, a
very large number!) This cooperative motion does not happen at high
temperatures, because then there is sufficient thermal energy to put
the various atoms into various different higher states. But at a
sufficiently low temperature there suddenly comes a moment in which
all the helium atoms try to go into the same state. The helium becomes
a superfluid. Incidentally, this phenomenon only appears with the
isotope of helium which has atomic weight $4$. For the helium isotope
of atomic weight $3$, the individual atoms are Fermi particles, and
the liquid is a normal fluid. Since superfluidity occurs only with
He$^4$, it is evidently a quantum mechanical effect—due to the Bose
nature of the $\alpha$-particle.</p>

<p class="p">Fermi particles act in a completely different way. Let’s see what
happens if we try to put two Fermi particles into the same state. We
will go back to our original example and ask for the amplitude that
two identical Fermi particles will be scattered into almost exactly
the same direction. The amplitude that particle $a$ will go in
direction $1$ and particle $b$ will go in direction $2$ is
\begin{equation*}
\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b},
\end{equation*}

whereas the amplitude that the outgoing directions will be
interchanged is
\begin{equation*}
\braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b}.
\end{equation*}

Since we have Fermi particles, the amplitude for the process is the
difference of these two amplitudes:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:4:44}
\braket{1}{a}\braket{2}{b}-\braket{2}{a}\braket{1}{b}.
\end{equation}

Let’s say that by “direction $1$” we mean that the particle has not
only a certain direction but also a given direction of its spin, and
that “direction $2$” is almost exactly the same as direction $1$ and
corresponds to the <em class="emph">same</em> spin direction. Then $\braket{1}{a}$
and $\braket{2}{a}$ are nearly equal. (This would not necessarily be
true if the outgoing states $1$ and $2$ did not have the same spin,
because there might be some reason why the amplitude would depend on
the spin direction.) Now if we let directions $1$ and $2$ approach
each other, the total amplitude in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII444">4.44</a>) becomes
zero. The result for Fermi particles is much simpler than for Bose
particles. It just isn’t possible at all for two Fermi
particles—such as two electrons—to get into exactly the same
state. You will never find two electrons in the same position with
their two spins in the same direction. It is not possible for two
electrons to have the same momentum and the same spin directions. If
they are at the same location or with the same state of motion, the
only possibility is that they must be spinning opposite to each other.</p>

try to see what would happen if only this one rule were
changed. First, we can show that every atom would be more or less the
same. Let’s start with the hydrogen atom. It would not be noticeably
affected. The proton of the nucleus would be surrounded by a
spherically symmetric electron cloud, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F11">4–11</a>(a). As we have described in
Chapter <a href="III_02.html">2</a>, the electron is attracted to the center, but
the uncertainty principle requires that there be a balance between the
concentration in space and in momentum. The balance means that there
must be a certain energy and a certain spread in the electron
distribution which determines the characteristic dimension of the

<p class="p">Now suppose that we have a nucleus with two units of charge, such as
the helium nucleus. This nucleus would attract two electrons, and if
they were Bose particles, they would—except for their electric
repulsion—both crowd in as close as possible to the nucleus. A
helium atom might look as shown in part (b) of the figure. Similarly,
a lithium atom which has a triply charged nucleus would have an
electron distribution like that shown in part (c) of
Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F11">4–11</a>. Every atom would look more or less the same—a
little round ball with all the electrons sitting near the nucleus,
nothing directional and nothing complicated.</p>

<div id="Ch4-S7-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Because electrons are Fermi particles, however, the actual situation is
quite different. For the hydrogen atom the situation is essentially
unchanged. The only difference is that the electron has a spin which we
indicate by the little arrow in Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F12">4–12</a>(a). In the
case of a helium atom, however, we cannot put two electrons on top of
each other. But wait, that is only true if their spins are the same. Two
electrons <em class="emph">can</em> occupy the same state if their spins are opposite.
So the helium atom does not look much different either. It would appear
as shown in part (b) of Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F12">4–12</a>. For lithium, however,
the situation becomes quite different. Where can we put the third
electron? The third electron cannot go on top of the other two because
both spin directions are occupied. (You remember that for an electron or
any particle with spin $1/2$ there are only two possible directions for
the spin.) The third electron can’t go near the place occupied by the
other two, so it must take up a special condition in a different kind of
state farther away from the nucleus in part (c) of the figure. (We are
speaking only in a rather rough way here, because in reality all three
electrons are identical; since we cannot really distinguish which one is
which, our picture is only an approximate one.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch4-S7-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we can begin to see why different atoms will have different chemical
properties. Because the third electron in lithium is farther out, it is
relatively more loosely bound. It is much easier to remove an electron
from lithium than from helium. (Experimentally, it takes $25$ electron
volts to ionize helium but only $5$ electron volts to ionize lithium.)
This accounts for the valence of the lithium atom. The directional
properties of the valence have to do with the pattern of the waves of
the outer electron, which we will not go into at the moment. But we can
already see the importance of the so-called <em class="emph">exclusion
principle</em>—which states that no two electrons can be found in exactly
the same state (including spin).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch4-S7-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">The exclusion principle is also responsible for the stability of
matter on a large scale. We explained earlier that the individual
atoms in matter did not collapse because of the uncertainty principle;
but this does not explain why it is that two hydrogen atoms can’t be
squeezed together as close as you want—why it is that all the
protons don’t get close together with one big smear of electrons
around them. The answer is, of course, that since no more than two
electrons—with opposite spins—can be in roughly the same place,
the hydrogen atoms must keep away from each other. So the stability of
matter on a large scale is really a consequence of the Fermi particle
nature of the electrons.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch4-S7-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Of course, if the outer electrons on two atoms have spins in opposite
directions, they can get close to each other. This is, in fact, just
the way that the chemical bond comes about. It turns out that two
atoms together will generally have the lowest energy if there is an
electron between them. It is a kind of an electrical attraction for
the two positive nuclei toward the electron in the middle. It is
possible to put two electrons more or less between the two nuclei so
long as their spins are opposite, and the strongest chemical binding
comes about this way. There is no stronger binding, because the
exclusion principle does not allow there to be more than two electrons
in the space between the atoms. We expect the hydrogen molecule to
look more or less as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F13">4–13</a>.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch4-S7-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">We want to mention one more consequence of the exclusion
principle. You remember that if both electrons in the helium atom are
to be close to the nucleus, their spins are necessarily opposite. Now
suppose that we would like to try to arrange to have both electrons
with the same spin—as we might consider doing by putting on a
fantastically strong magnetic field that would try to line up the
spins in the same direction. But then the two electrons could not
occupy the same state in space. One of them would have to take on a
different geometrical position, as indicated in Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F14">4–14</a>.
The electron which is located farther from the nucleus has less binding
energy. The energy of the whole atom is therefore quite a bit higher. In
other words, when the two spins are opposite, there is a much stronger
total attraction.

<div id="Ch4-S7-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">So, there is an apparent, enormous force trying to line up spins
opposite to each other when two electrons are close together. If two
electrons are trying to go in the same place, there is a very strong
tendency for the spins to become lined opposite. This apparent force
trying to orient the two spins opposite to each other is much more
powerful than the tiny force between the two magnetic moments of the
electrons. You remember when we were speaking of ferromagnetism there
was the mystery of why the electrons in different atoms had a strong
tendency to line up parallel. Although there is still no quantitative
explanation, it is believed that what happens is that the electrons
around the core of one atom interact through the exclusion principle
with the outer electrons which have become free to wander throughout
the crystal. This interaction causes the spins of the free electrons
and the inner electrons to take on opposite directions. But the free
electrons and the inner atomic electrons can only be opposite provided
all the inner electrons have the same spin direction, as indicated in
Fig. <a href="#Ch4-F15">4–15</a>. It seems probable that it is the effect of
the exclusion principle acting indirectly through the free electrons
that gives rise to the strong aligning forces responsible for
ferromagnetism.</p>

<div id="Ch4-S7-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">We will mention one further example of the influence of the exclusion
principle. We have said earlier that the nuclear forces are the same
between the neutron and the proton, between the proton and the proton,
and between the neutron and the neutron. Why is it then that a proton
and a neutron can stick together to make a deuterium nucleus, whereas
there is no nucleus with just two protons or with just two neutrons?
The deuteron is, as a matter of fact, bound by an energy of about
$2.2$ million electron volts, yet, there is no corresponding binding between a
pair of protons to make an isotope of helium with the atomic
weight $2$. Such nuclei do not exist. The combination of two protons does not
make a bound state.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch4-S7-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">The answer is a result of two effects: first, the exclusion principle;
and second, the fact that the nuclear forces are somewhat sensitive to
the direction of spin. The force between a neutron and a proton is
attractive and somewhat stronger when the spins are parallel than when
they are opposite. It happens that these forces are just different
enough that a deuteron can only be made if the neutron and proton have
their spins parallel; when their spins are opposite, the attraction is
not quite strong enough to bind them together. Since the spins of the
neutron and proton are each one-half and are in the same direction,
the deuteron has a spin of one. We know, however, that two protons are
not allowed to sit on top of each other if their spins are
parallel. If it were not for the exclusion principle, two protons
would be bound, but since they cannot exist at the same place and with
the same spin directions, the He$^2$ nucleus does not exist. The
protons could come together with their spins opposite, but then there
is not enough binding to make a stable nucleus, because the nuclear
force for opposite spins is too weak to bind a pair of nucleons. The
attractive force between neutrons and protons of opposite spins can be
seen by scattering experiments. Similar scattering experiments with
two protons with parallel spins show that there is the corresponding
attraction. So it is the exclusion principle that helps explain why
deuterium can exist when He$^2$ cannot.</p>
