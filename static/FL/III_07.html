<p class="p">We want now to talk a little bit about the behavior of probability
amplitudes in time. We say a “little bit,” because the actual
behavior in time necessarily involves the behavior in space as
well. Thus, we get immediately into the most complicated possible
situation if we are to do it correctly and in detail. We are always in
the difficulty that we can either treat something in a logically
rigorous but quite abstract way, or we can do something which is not
at all rigorous but which gives us some idea of a real
situation—postponing until later a more careful treatment. With
regard to energy dependence, we are going to take the second
course. We will make a number of statements. We will not try to be
rigorous—but will just be telling you things that have been found
out, to give you some feeling for the behavior of amplitudes as a
function of time. As we go along, the precision of the description
will increase, so don’t get nervous that we seem to be picking things
out of the air. It is, of course, all out of the air—the air of
experiment and of the imagination of people. But it would take us too
long to go over the historical development, so we have to plunge in
somewhere. We could plunge into the abstract and deduce
everything—which you would not understand—or we could go through a
large number of experiments to justify each statement. We choose to do
something in between.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch7-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">An electron alone in empty space can, under certain circumstances,
have a certain definite energy. For example, if it is standing still
(so it has no translational motion, no momentum, or kinetic energy),
it has its rest energy. A more complicated object like an atom can
also have a definite energy when standing still, but it could also be
internally excited to another energy level. (We will describe later
the machinery of this.) We can often think of an atom in an excited
state as having a definite energy, but this is really only
approximately true. An atom doesn’t stay excited forever because it
manages to discharge its energy by its interaction with the
electromagnetic field. So there is some amplitude that a new state is
generated—with the atom in a lower state, and the electromagnetic
field in a higher state, of excitation. The total energy of the system
is the same before and after, but the energy of the <em class="emph">atom</em> is
reduced. So it is not precise to say an excited atom has a
<em class="emph">definite</em> energy; but it will often be convenient and not too
wrong to say that it does.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch7-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">[Incidentally, why does it go one way instead of the other way? Why
does an atom radiate light? The answer has to do with entropy. When
the energy is in the electromagnetic field, there are so many
different ways it can be—so many different places where it can
wander—that if we look for the equilibrium condition, we find that
in the most probable situation the field is excited with a photon, and
the atom is de-excited. It takes a very long time for the photon to
come back and find that it can knock the atom back up again. It’s
quite analogous to the classical problem: Why does an accelerating
charge radiate? It isn’t that it “wants” to lose energy, because, in
fact, when it radiates, the energy of the world is the same as it was
before. Radiation or absorption goes in the direction of increasing
<em class="emph">entropy</em>.]</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch7-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Nuclei can also exist in different energy levels, and in an
approximation which disregards the electromagnetic effects, we can say
that a nucleus in an excited state stays there. Although we know that
it doesn’t stay there forever, it is often useful to start out with an
approximation which is somewhat idealized and easier to think
about. Also it is often a legitimate approximation under certain
circumstances. (When we first introduced the classical laws of a
falling body, we did not include friction, but there is almost never a
case in which there isn’t <em class="emph">some</em> friction.)</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch7-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Then there are the subnuclear “strange particles,” which have
various masses. But the heavier ones disintegrate into other light
particles, so again it is not correct to say that they have a
precisely definite energy. That would be true only if they lasted
forever. So when we make the approximation that they have a definite
energy, we are forgetting the fact that they must blow up. For the
moment, then, we will intentionally forget about such processes and
learn later how to take them into account.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch7-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose we have an atom—or an electron, or any particle—which at
rest would have a definite energy $E_0$. By the energy $E_0$ we mean
the mass of the whole thing times $c^2$. This mass includes any
internal energy; so an excited atom has a mass which is different from
the mass of the same atom in the ground state. (The <em class="emph">ground</em> state means the
state of lowest energy.) We will call $E_0$ the “energy at rest.”</p>

<div id="Ch7-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">For an atom <em class="emph">at rest</em>, the quantum mechanical <em class="emph">amplitude</em> to
find an atom at a place is the <em class="emph">same everywhere</em>; it does
<em class="emph">not</em> depend on position. This means, of course, that the
<em class="emph">probability</em> of <em class="emph">finding</em> the atom anywhere is the
same. But it means even more. The <em class="emph">probability</em> could be
independent of position, and still the <em class="emph">phase</em> of the
<em class="emph">amplitude</em> could vary from point to point. But for a particle at
rest, the complete amplitude is identical everywhere. It does,
however, depend on the <em class="emph">time</em>. For a particle in a state of
definite energy $E_0$, the amplitude to find the particle at $(x,y,z)$
at the time $t$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:7:1}
ae^{-i(E_0/\hbar)t},
\end{equation}

where $a$ is some constant. The amplitude to be at any point in space
is the same for all points, but depends on time according
to (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII71">7.1</a>). We shall simply assume this rule to be true.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch7-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Of course, we could also write (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII71">7.1</a>) as

ae^{-i\omega t},
\end{equation}

with
\begin{equation*}
\hbar\omega=E_0=Mc^2,
\end{equation*}

where $M$ is the rest mass of the atomic state, or particle. There are
three different ways of specifying the energy: by the frequency of an
amplitude, by the energy in the classical sense, or by the
inertia. They are all equivalent; they are just different ways of
saying the same thing.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch7-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">You may be thinking that it is strange to think of a “particle”
which has equal amplitudes to be found throughout all space. After
all, we usually imagine a “particle” as a small object located
“somewhere.”  But don’t forget the uncertainty principle. If a
particle has a definite energy, it has also a definite momentum. If
the uncertainty in momentum is zero, the uncertainty relation, $\Delta
p\,\Delta x=\hbar$, tells us that the uncertainty in the position must
be infinite, and that is just what we are saying when we say that
there is the same amplitude to find the particle at all points in
space.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch7-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">If the internal parts of an atom are in a different state with a
different total energy, then the variation of the amplitude with time
is different. If you don’t know in which state it is, there will be a
certain amplitude to be in one state and a certain amplitude to be in
another—and each of these amplitudes will have a different
frequency. There will be an interference between these different
components—like a beat-note—which can show up as a varying
probability. Something will be “going on” inside of the atom—even
though it is “at rest” in the sense that its center of mass is not
drifting. However, if the atom has one definite energy, the amplitude
is given by (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII71">7.1</a>), and the absolute square of this
amplitude does not depend on time. You see, then, that if a thing has
a definite energy and if you ask any <em class="emph">probability</em> question about
it, the answer is independent of time. Although the <em class="emph">amplitudes</em>
vary with time, if the energy is <em class="emph">definite</em> they vary as an
imaginary exponential, and the absolute value doesn’t change.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch7-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">That’s why we often say that an atom in a definite energy level is in
a <em class="emph">stationary state</em>. If you make any measurements of the things
inside, you’ll find that nothing (in probability) will change in
time. In order to have the probabilities change in time, we have to
have the interference of two amplitudes at two different frequencies,
and that means that we cannot know what the energy is. The object will
have one amplitude to be in a state of one energy and another
amplitude to be in a state of another energy. That’s the quantum
mechanical description of something when its <em class="emph">behavior</em> depends
on time.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch7-S1-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">If we have a “condition” which is a mixture of two different states
with different energies, then the amplitude for each of the two states
varies with time according to Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII72">7.2</a>), for instance,
as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:7:3}
e^{-i(E_1/\hbar)t}\quad
\text{and}\quad
e^{-i(E_2/\hbar)t}.
\end{equation}

And if we have some combination of the two, we will have an
interference. But notice that if we added a constant to both energies,
it wouldn’t make any difference. If somebody else were to use a
different scale of energy in which all the energies were increased (or
decreased) by a constant amount—say, by the amount $A$—then the
amplitudes in the two states would, from his point of view, be
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:7:4}
e^{-i(E_1+A)t/\hbar}\quad
\text{and}\quad
e^{-i(E_2+A)t/\hbar}.
\end{equation}

All of his amplitudes would be multiplied by the same factor
$e^{-i(A/\hbar)t}$, and all linear combinations, or interferences,
would have the same factor. When we take the absolute squares to find
the probabilities, all the answers would be the same. The choice of an
origin for our energy scale makes no difference; we can measure energy
from any zero we want. For relativistic purposes it is nice to measure
the energy so that the rest mass is included, but for many purposes
that aren’t relativistic it is often nice to subtract some standard
amount from all energies that appear. For instance, in the case of an
atom, it is usually convenient to subtract the energy $M_sc^2$, where
$M_s$ is the mass of all the <em class="emph">separate</em> pieces—the nucleus and
the electrons—which is, of course, different from the mass of the
atom. For other problems it may be useful to subtract from all
energies the amount $M_gc^2$, where $M_g$ is the mass of the whole
atom <em class="emph">in the ground</em> state; then the energy that appears is just
the excitation energy of the atom. So, sometimes we may shift our zero
of energy by some very large constant, but it doesn’t make any
difference, provided we shift all the energies in a particular
calculation by the same constant. So much for a particle standing
still.</p>

<div id="Ch7-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">If we suppose that the relativity theory is right, a particle at rest
in one inertial system can be in uniform motion in another inertial
system. In the rest frame of the particle, the probability amplitude
is the same for all $x$, $y$, and $z$ but varies with $t$. The
<em class="emph">magnitude</em> of the amplitude is the same for all $t$, but the
<em class="emph">phase</em> depends on $t$. We can get a kind of a picture of the
behavior of the amplitude if we plot lines of equal phase—say, lines
of zero phase—as a function of $x$ and $t$. For a particle at rest,
these equal-phase lines are parallel to the $x$-axis and are equally
spaced in the $t$-coordinate, as shown by the dashed lines in

by the Lorentz transformation. This transformation can be represented
graphically by drawing $x'$ and $t'$ axes, as is done in
Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F1">7–1</a>. (See Chapter <a href="I_17.html">17</a>, Vol. I,
Fig. <a href="I_17.html#Ch17-F2">17–2</a>) You can see that in the $x'$-$t'$ system,
points of equal phase<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> have a different spacing along
the $t'$-axis, so the frequency of the time variation is different. Also

<div id="Ch7-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Under a Lorentz transformation for the velocity $v$, say along the
negative $x$-direction, the time $t$ is related to the time $t'$ by
\begin{equation*}
t=\frac{t'-x'v/c^2}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}},
\end{equation*}

so our amplitude now varies as
\begin{equation*}
e^{-(i/\hbar)E_0t}=
e^{-(i/\hbar)(E_0t'/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}-E_0vx'/c^2\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2})}.

In the prime system it varies in space as well as in time. If we write
the amplitude as
\begin{equation*}
e^{-(i/\hbar)(E_p't'-p'x')},
\end{equation*}

we see that $E_p'=E_0/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ is the energy computed
classically for a particle of rest energy $E_0$ travelling at the

invariant. In the rest frame of the particle, $p_\mu x_\mu$ is
just $Et$; so if we transform to another frame, $Et$ will be replaced by
\begin{equation*}
E't'-\FLPp'\cdot\FLPx'.

Thus, the probability amplitude of a particle which has the

problems, we can write
\begin{equation}

E_p=M_sc^2+W_p,
\end{equation}

where $W_p$ is the energy over and above the rest energy $M_sc^2$ of
the parts of the atom. In general, $W_p$ would include both the

from place to place so that the probability depends on position and

by considering amplitudes which are a superposition of two or more
amplitudes for states of definite energy. We have already discussed
this situation in Chapter <a href="I_48.html">48</a> of Vol. I—even for probability
amplitudes! We found that the sum of two amplitudes with different
wave numbers $k$ (that is, momenta) and frequencies $\omega$ (that is,
energies) gives interference humps, or beats, so that the square of
the amplitude varies with space and time. We also found that these
beats move with the so-called “group velocity” given by
\begin{equation*}
v_g=\frac{\Delta\omega}{\Delta k},
\end{equation*}

where $\Delta k$ and $\Delta\omega$ are the differences between the
wave numbers and frequencies for the two waves. For more complicated
waves—made up of the sum of many amplitudes all near the same

that we cannot deduce from the theory of relativity. We said what the

<p class="p">Now we would like to discuss what happens when the energy of a
particle can change. We begin by thinking of a particle which moves in
a force field described by a potential. We discuss first the effect of
a constant potential. Suppose that we have a large metal can which we
have raised to some electrostatic potential $\phi$, as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F2">7–2</a>. If there are charged objects inside the can,
their potential energy will be $q\phi$, which we will call $V$, and will
be absolutely independent of position. Then there can be no change in
the physics inside, because the constant potential doesn’t make any
difference so far as anything going on inside the can is concerned. Now
there is no way we can deduce what the answer should be, so we must make
a guess. The guess which works is more or less what you might expect:
For the energy, we must use the sum of the potential energy $V$ and the
energy $E_p$—which is itself the sum of the internal and kinetic
energies. The amplitude is proportional to
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:7:18}
e^{-(i/\hbar)[(E_p+V)t-\FLPp\cdot\FLPx]}.
\end{equation}

The <em class="emph">general principle</em> is that the coefficient of $t$, which we
may call $\omega$, is always given by the <em class="emph">total energy</em> of the
system: internal (or “mass”) energy, plus kinetic energy, plus
potential energy:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:7:19}
\hbar\omega=E_p+V.
\end{equation}

Or, for nonrelativistic situations,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:7:20}

different energy states, what will we get? The amplitude for each
state has the same additional factor
\begin{equation*}
e^{-(i/\hbar)Vt}

over what it would have with $V=0$. That is just like a change in the
zero of our energy scale. It produces an equal phase change in all
amplitudes, but as we have seen before, this doesn’t change any of the
probabilities. All the physical phenomena are the same. (We have
assumed that we are talking about different states of the same charged
object, so that $q\phi$ is the same for all. If an object could change
its charge in going from one state to another, we would have quite
another result, but conservation of charge prevents this.)</p>

<p class="p">So far, our assumption agrees with what we would expect for a change
of energy reference level. But if it is really right, it should hold
for a potential energy that is not just a constant. In general, $V$
could vary in any arbitrary way with both time and space, and the
complete result for the amplitude must be given in terms of a
differential equation. We don’t want to get concerned with the general
case right now, but only want to get some idea about how some things
happen, so we will think only of a potential that is constant in time
and varies very slowly in space. Then we can make a comparison between
the classical and quantum ideas.</p>

<p class="p">The barrier penetration by a quantum mechanical amplitude gives the
explanation—or description—of the $\alpha$-particle decay of a
uranium nucleus. The potential energy of an $\alpha$-particle, as a
function of the distance from the center, is shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F6">7–6</a>(a). If one tried to shoot an $\alpha$-particle
with the energy $E$ <em class="emph">into</em> the nucleus, it would feel an
electrostatic repulsion from the nuclear charge $z$ and would,
classically, get no closer than the distance $r_1$ where its total
energy is equal to the potential energy $V$. Closer in, however, the
potential energy is much lower because of the strong attraction of the
short-range nuclear forces. How is it then that in radioactive decay we
find $\alpha$-particles which started out inside the nucleus coming out
with the energy $E$? Because they start out with the energy $E$ inside
the nucleus and “leak” through the potential barrier. The probability
amplitude is roughly as sketched in part (b) of Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F6">7–6</a>,
although actually the exponential decay is much larger than shown. It
is, in fact, quite remarkable that the mean life of an $\alpha$-particle
in the uranium nucleus is as long as $4\tfrac{1}{2}$ billion years, when
the natural oscillations inside the nucleus are so extremely
rapid—about $10^{22}$ per sec! How can one get a number like
$10^9$ years from $10^{-22}$ sec? The answer is that the exponential gives the
tremendously small factor of about $e^{-45}$—which gives the very
small, though definite, probability of leakage. Once the
$\alpha$-particle is in the nucleus, there is almost no amplitude at all
for finding it outside; however, if you take many nuclei and wait long
enough, you may be lucky and find one that has come out.</p>

$x$-direction and enters a region where there is a potential that varies
with $y$, the particle will get a transverse acceleration from the

<p class="p">It is now up to us to see if our idea that the waves go
as (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII720">7.20</a>) will explain the same result. We look at the same
thing quantum mechanically, assuming that everything is on a very large
scale compared with a wavelength of our probability amplitudes. In any
small region we can say that the amplitude varies as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:7:27}
e^{-(i/\hbar)[(W+p^2/2M+V)t-\FLPp\cdot\FLPx]}.

Can we see that this will also give rise to a deflection of the particle
when $V$ has a transverse gradient? We have sketched in
Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F8">7–8</a> what the waves of probability amplitude will look
like. We have drawn a set of “wave nodes” which you
can think of as surfaces where the phase of the amplitude is zero. In
every small region, the wavelength—the distance between successive
nodes—is
\begin{equation*}
\lambda=\frac{h}{p},
\end{equation*}

where $p$ is related to $V$ through
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:7:28}
W+\frac{p^2}{2M}+V=\text{const}.

In the region where $V$ is larger, $p$ is smaller, and the wavelength
is longer. So the angle of the wave nodes gets changed as shown in the

two paths $a$ and $b$ in Fig. <a href="#Ch7-F8">7–8</a> there is a difference
of potential $\Delta V=(\ddpl{V}{y})D$, so there is a difference $\Delta p$
in the momentum along the two tracks which can be obtained
from (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII728">7.28</a>):
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:7:29}
\Delta\biggl(\frac{p^2}{2M}\biggr)=\frac{p}{M}\,\Delta p=
-\Delta V.
\end{equation}

The wave number $p/\hbar$ is, therefore, different along the two
paths, which means that the phase is advancing at a different
rate. The difference in the rate of increase of phase is $\Delta
k=\Delta p/\hbar$, so the accumulated phase difference in the total
distance $w$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:7:30}
\Delta(\text{phase})=\Delta k\cdot w=
\frac{\Delta p}{\hbar}\cdot w=
-\frac{M}{p\hbar}\,\Delta V\cdot w.
\end{equation}

This is the amount by which the phase on path $b$ is “ahead” of the
phase on path $a$ as the wave leaves the strip. But outside the strip,
a phase advance of this amount corresponds to the wave node being
ahead by the amount
\begin{equation}
\Delta x=\frac{\lambda}{2\pi}\,\Delta(\text{phase})=
\frac{\hbar}{p}\,\Delta(\text{phase})\notag

variation. If we wanted to give a quantum mechanical description, we

varied one way and that those in the other beam had an opposite energy
variation. (We could put the magnetic energy $U$ into the potential
energy $V$ or into the “internal” energy $W$; it doesn’t matter.)

(We can consider that this is, in effect, a definition of $\mu_z$.) In

time $\tau$, its probability amplitude will be multiplied by
\begin{equation*}
e^{-(i/\hbar)(-\mu_zB)\tau}

over what it would be in no field. Since for a spin one-half particle,
$\mu_z$ can be either plus or minus some number, say $\mu$, the two
possible states in a uniform field would have their phases changing at

skipped Chapter <a href="III_06.html">6</a>, you can just take (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII735">7.35</a>)

Chapter <a href="III_10.html">10</a>) a more complete discussion of spin precession,
including a derivation of these amplitudes.
