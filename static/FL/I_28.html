                        which great syntheses take place, where phenomena which previously had

                        aspects of the same thing. The history of physics is the history of
                        such syntheses, and the basis of the success of physical science is

                        <p class="p">Perhaps the most dramatic moment in the development of physics during the
                        19th century occurred to J. C. Maxwell one day in the 1860s, when he combined the laws of electricity and
                        magnetism with the laws of the behavior of light. As a result, the properties of
                        light were partly unravelled—that old and subtle stuff that is so important
                        and mysterious that it was felt necessary to arrange a special creation for
                        it when writing Genesis. Maxwell
                        could say, when he was finished with his discovery, “Let there be electricity
                        and magnetism, and there is light!”</p>

                        <p class="p">For this culminating moment there was a long preparation in the
                        gradual discovery and unfolding of the laws of electricity and
                        magnetism. This story we shall reserve for detailed study next
                        year. However, the story is, briefly, as follows. The gradually
                        discovered properties of electricity and magnetism, of electric forces
                        of attraction and repulsion, and of magnetic forces, showed that
                        although these forces were rather complex, they all fell off inversely
                        as the square of the distance. We know, for example, that the simple
                        Coulomb law
                        for stationary charges is that the electric force field
                        varies inversely as the square of the distance. As a consequence, for
                        sufficiently great distances there is very little influence of one
                        system of charges on another.
                        Maxwell noted that the
                        equations or the laws that had been discovered up to this time were
                        mutually inconsistent when he tried to put them all together, and in
                        order for the whole system to be consistent, he had to add another term
                        to his equations. With this new term there came an amazing prediction,
                        which was that a part of the electric and magnetic fields would fall off
                        much more slowly with the distance than the inverse square, namely,
                        inversely as the first power of the distance! And so he realized that
                        electric currents in one place can affect other charges far away, and he
                        predicted the basic effects with which we are familiar today—radio
                        transmission, radar, and so on.</p>

                        electrical influences, be heard thousands of miles away in Los
                        Angeles. How is it possible? It is because the fields do not vary as
                        the inverse square, but only inversely as the first power of the
                        distance. Finally, then, even light itself was recognized to be
                        electric and magnetic influences extending over vast distances,
                        generated by an almost incredibly rapid oscillation of the electrons
                        in the atoms. All these phenomena we summarize by the word

                        understand some aspects of it, and so we shall now go over some parts
                        of it again in greater detail. We begin by describing the position of
                        physics at the end of the 19th century. All that was then known about
                        the fundamental laws can be summarized as follows.</p>

                        <p class="p">First, there were laws of forces: one force was the law of
                        gravitation, which we have written down several times; the force on an
                        object of mass $m$, due to another of mass $M$, is given by
                        \begin{equation}

                        \end{equation}
                        where $\FLPe_r$ is a unit vector directed from $m$ to $M$, and $r$ is
                        the distance between them.</p>

                        <p class="p">Next, the laws of electricity and magnetism, as known at the end of
                        the 19th century, are these: the electrical forces acting on a
                        charge $q$ can be described by two fields, called $\FLPE$ and $\FLPB$, and
                        the velocity $\FLPv$ of the charge $q$, by the equation
                        \begin{equation}
                        \label{Eq:I:28:2}
                        \FLPF=q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB).
                        \end{equation}
                        To complete this law, we have to say what the formulas for $\FLPE$
                        and $\FLPB$ are in a given circumstance: if a number of charges are
                        present, $\FLPE$ and the $\FLPB$ are each the sum of contributions,
                        one from each individual charge. So if we can find the $\FLPE$
                        and $\FLPB$ produced by a single charge, we need only to add all the
                        effects from all the charges in the universe to get the total $\FLPE$
                        and $\FLPB$!  This is the principle of
                        superposition.

                        one individual charge? It turns out that this is very complicated, and
                        it takes a great deal of study and sophistication to appreciate
                        it. But that is not the point. We write down the law now only to
                        impress the reader with the beauty of nature, so to speak, i.e., that
                        it is <em class="emph">possible</em> to summarize all the fundamental knowledge on
                        one page, with notations that he is now familiar with. This law for
                        the fields of an individual charge is complete and accurate, so far as
                        we know (except for quantum mechanics) but it looks rather
                        complicated. We shall not study all the pieces now; we only write it
                        down to give an impression, to show that it can be written, and so
                        that we can see ahead of time roughly what it looks like. As a matter
                        of fact, the most <em class="emph">useful</em> way to write the correct laws of
                        electricity and magnetism is not the way we shall now write them, but
                        involves what are called <em class="emph">field equations</em>, which we shall learn
                        about next year. But the mathematical notations for these are
                        different and new, and so we write the law in an inconvenient form for
                        calculation, but in notations that we now know.

                        What do the various terms tell us? Take the first term,
                        $\FLPE=-q\FLPe_{r'}/4\pi\epsO r'^2$. That, of course, is
                        Coulomb’s law, which we
                        already know: $q$ is the charge that is producing the
                        field; $\FLPe_{r'}$ is the unit vector in the direction from the
                        point $P$ where $\FLPE$ is measured, $r$ is the distance from $P$
                        to $q$. But, Coulomb’s law is wrong.
                        The discoveries of the 19th century
                        showed that influences cannot travel faster than a certain fundamental
                        speed $c$, which we now call the speed of light. It is not correct
                        that the first term is Coulomb’s law,
                        not only because it is not
                        possible to know where the charge is <em class="emph">now</em> and at what distance
                        it is <em class="emph">now</em>, but also because the only thing that can affect the
                        field at a given place and time is the behavior of the charges in the
                        <em class="emph">past</em>. How <em class="emph">far</em> in the past?  The time delay, or
                        <em class="emph">retarded time</em>,
                        so-called, is the time it takes, at speed $c$, to get from the charge to
                        the field point $P$. The delay is $r'/c$.</p>

                        <p class="p">So to allow for this time delay, we put a little prime on $r$, meaning
                        how far away it <em class="emph">was</em> when the information now arriving at $P$
                        left $q$. Just for a moment suppose that the charge carried a light,
                        and that the light could only come to $P$ at the speed $c$. Then when
                        we look at $q$, we would not see where it is now, of course, but where
                        it <em class="emph">was</em> at some earlier time. What appears in our formula is the
                        <em class="emph">apparent</em> direction&nbsp;$\FLPe_{r&#39;}$—the direction it used to
                        be—the so-called <em class="emph">retarded</em> direction—and at the
                        <em class="emph">retarded</em> distance $r'$. That would be easy enough to
                        understand, too, but it is also wrong. The whole thing is much more

                        put it very crudely. It suggests that we should calculate the delayed
                        Coulomb field and add a correction to it, which is its rate of change
                        times the time delay that we use. Nature seems to be attempting to
                        guess what the field at the present time is going to be, by taking the
                        rate of change and multiplying by the time that is delayed. But we are
                        not yet through. There is a third term—the second derivative, with
                        respect to $t$, of the unit vector in the direction of the charge. Now
                        the formula <em class="emph">is</em> finished, and that is all there is to the

                        <p class="p">What had to be added in the 20th century was that the dynamical laws of
                        Newton were found to be all wrong, and quantum mechanics had to be
                        introduced to correct them. Newton’s laws
                        are approximately
                        valid when the scale of things is sufficiently large. These
                        quantum-mechanical laws, combined with the laws of electricity, have
                        only recently been combined to form a set of laws called <em class="emph">quantum
                            electrodynamics</em>. In addition, there were
                        discovered a number of new phenomena, of which the first was
                        radioactivity, discovered by
                        Becquerel in
                        1898—he just sneaked it in under the 19th century.
                        This phenomenon of radioactivity was followed up to produce our
                        knowledge of nuclei and new kinds of forces that are not gravitational
                        and not electrical, but new particles with different interactions, a
                        subject which has still not been unravelled.</p>

                        not being entirely accurate. There was a problem that was not quite
                        solved at the end of the 19th century. When we try to calculate the
                        field from all the charges <em class="emph">including the charge itself that we
                            want the field to act on</em>, we get into trouble trying to find the
                        distance, for example, of a charge from itself, and dividing something
                        by that distance, which is zero. The problem of how to handle the part
                        of this field which is generated by the very charge on which we want
                        the field to act is not yet solved today. So we leave it there; we do
                        not have a complete solution to that puzzle yet, and so we shall avoid
                        the puzzle for as long as we can.</p>

                        discuss the phenomena called radiation. To discuss these phenomena, we
                        must select from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI283">28.3</a>) only that piece which varies
                        inversely as the distance and not as the square of the distance. It
                        turns out that when we finally do find that piece, it is so simple in
                        its form that it is legitimate to study optics and electrodynamics in
                        an elementary way by taking it as “the law” of the electric field
                        produced by a moving charge far away. We shall take it temporarily as
                        a given law which we will learn about in detail next year.</p>

                        <p class="p">Of the terms appearing in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI283">28.3</a>), the first one evidently
                        goes inversely as the square of the distance, and the second is only a
                        correction for delay, so it is easy to show that both of them vary
                        inversely as the square of the distance. All of the effects we are
                        interested in come from the third term, which is not very complicated,
                        after all. What this term says is: look at the charge and note the
                        direction of the unit vector (we can project the end of it onto the
                        surface of a unit sphere). As the charge moves around, the unit vector
                        wiggles, and <em class="emph">the acceleration of that unit vector is what we are
                            looking for</em>. That is all. Thus

                        is a statement of the laws of radiation, because that is the only
                        important term when we get far enough away that the fields are varying
                        inversely as the distance. (The parts that go as the square have
                        fallen off so much that we are not interested in them.)</p>

                        <p class="p">Now we can go a little bit further in studying (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI285">28.5</a>) to
                        see what it means. Suppose a charge is moving in any manner
                        whatsoever, and we are observing it from a distance. We imagine for a
                        moment that in a sense it is “lit up” (although it is light that we
                        are trying to explain); we imagine it as a little white dot. Then we
                        would see this white dot running around. But we don’t see
                        <em class="emph">exactly</em> how it is running around right <em class="emph">now</em>, because of
                        the delay that we have been talking about. What counts is how it was
                        moving <em class="emph">earlier</em>. The unit vector $\FLPe_{r'}$ is pointed toward
                        the apparent position of the charge. Of course, the end
                        of $\FLPe_{r'}$ goes on a slight curve, so that its acceleration has two
                        components. One is the transverse piece, because the end of it goes up
                        and down, and the other is a radial piece because it stays on a
                        sphere. It is easy to demonstrate that the latter is much smaller and
                        varies as the inverse square of $r$ when $r$ is very great. This is
                        easy to see, for when we imagine that we move a given source farther
                        and farther away, then the wigglings of $\FLPe_{r'}$ look smaller and
                        smaller, inversely as the distance, but the radial component of
                        acceleration is varying much more rapidly than inversely as the
                        distance. So for practical purposes all we have to do is project the
                        motion on a plane at unit distance. Therefore we find the following
                        rule: Imagine that we look at the moving charge and that everything we
                        see is delayed—like a painter trying to paint a scene on a screen at
                        a unit distance. A real painter, of course, does not take into account
                        the fact that light is going at a certain speed, but paints the world
                        as he sees it. We want to see what his picture would look like. So we
                        see a dot, representing the charge, moving about in the picture. The
                        acceleration of that dot is proportional to the electric field. That
                        is all—all we need.</p>

                        <p class="p">Thus Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI285">28.5</a>) is the complete and correct formula for
                        radiation; even relativity effects are all contained in it. However,
                        we often want to apply it to a still simpler circumstance in which the
                        charges are moving only a small distance at a relatively slow
                        rate. Since they are moving slowly, they do not move an appreciable
                        distance from where they start, so that the delay time is practically
                        constant. Then the law is still simpler, because the delay time is
                        fixed. Thus we imagine that the charge is executing a very tiny motion
                        at an effectively constant distance. The delay at the distance $r$
                        is $r/c$. Then our rule becomes the following: If the charged object is
                        moving in a very small motion and it is laterally displaced by the
                        distance $x(t)$, then the angle that the unit vector $\FLPe_{r'}$ is
                        displaced is $x/r$, and since $r$ is practically constant, the
                        $x$-component of $d^2\FLPe_{r'}/dt^2$ is simply the acceleration
                        of $x$ itself at an earlier time divided by $r$, and so finally we get
                        the law we want, which is
                        \begin{equation}
                        \label{Eq:I:28:6}
                        E_x(t)=\frac{-q}{4\pi\epsO c^2r}\,a_x
                        \Bigl(t-\frac{r}{c}\Bigr).

                        wiggle at all, and it has no acceleration. So it is only the sidewise
                        motion which is important, only the acceleration that we see projected

                        nonrelativistically at a very large distance $r$ approaches that
                        form. The electric field varies inversely as $r$ and is proportional
                        to the acceleration of the charge, projected onto the “plane of
                        sight,” and this acceleration is not today’s acceleration, but the
                        acceleration that it had at an earlier time, the amount of delay being
                        a time, $r/c$. In the remainder of this chapter we shall discuss this

                        we shall accept it as true, but not just on a theoretical basis. We
                        may devise a number of experiments which illustrate the character of
                        the law. In order to do so, we need an accelerating charge. It should
                        be a single charge, but if we can make a great many charges move
                        together, all the same way, we know that the field will be the sum of
                        the effects of each of the individual charges; we just add them
                        together. As an example, consider two pieces of wire connected to a
                        generator, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch28-F1">28–1</a>. The idea is that the
                        generator makes a potential difference, or a field, which pulls
                        electrons away from piece $A$ and pushes them into $B$ at one moment,
                        and then, an infinitesimal time later, it reverses the effect and
                        pulls the electrons out of $B$ and pumps them back into $A$<span class="text italic">!</span>
                        So in these two wires charges, let us say, are accelerating upward in
                        wire $A$ and upward in wire $B$ for one moment, and a moment later
                        they are accelerating downward in wire $A$ and downward in wire $B$.
                        The fact that we need two wires and a generator is merely that
                        this is a way of doing it. The net result is that we merely have a
                        charge accelerating up and down as though $A$ and $B$ were one single
                        wire. A wire that is very short compared with the distance light
                        travels in one oscillation period is called an <em class="emph">electric dipole
                            oscillator</em>. Thus we have the circumstance that we need to apply our
                        law, which tells us that this charge makes an electric field, and so
                        we need an instrument to detect an electric field, and the instrument
                        we use is the same thing—a pair of wires like $A$ and $B$<span class="text italic">!</span>
                        If an electric field is applied to such a device, it will produce a
                        force which will pull the electrons up on both wires or down on both
                        wires. This signal is detected by means of a rectifier mounted between
                        $A$ and $B$, and a tiny, fine wire carries the information into an
                        amplifier, where it is amplified so we can hear the audiofrequency
                        tone with which the radiofrequency is modulated. When this probe feels
                        an electric field, there will be a loud noise coming out of the
                        loudspeaker, and when there is no electric field driving it, there
                        will be no noise.</p>

                        <p class="p">Because the room in which the waves we are measuring has other objects
                        in it, our electric field will shake electrons in these other objects;
                        the electric field makes these other charges go up and down, and in
                        going up and down, these also produce an effect on our probe. Thus for
                        a successful experiment we must hold things fairly close together, so
                        that the influences from the walls and from ourselves—the reflected

                        appreciate the law.</p>

                        <p class="p">Now we turn the generator on and hear the audio signal. We find a
                        strong field when the detector $D$ is parallel to the generator $G$ at
                        point $1$ (Fig. <a href="#Ch28-F2">28–2</a>). We find the same amount of field
                        also at any other azimuth angle about the axis of $G$, because it has
                        no directional effects. On the other hand, when the detector is at $3$
                        the field is zero. That is all right, because our formula said that
                        the field should be the acceleration of the charge <em class="emph">projected
                            perpendicular</em> to the line of sight. Therefore when we look down
                        on $G$, the charge is moving toward and away from $D$, and there is no
                        effect. So that checks the first rule, that there is no effect when
                        the charge is moving directly toward us. Secondly, the formula says
                        that the electric field should be perpendicular to $r$ and in the
                        plane of $G$ and $r$; so if we put $D$ at $1$ but rotate it
                        $90^\circ$, we should get no signal. And this is just what we find,
                        the electric field is indeed vertical, and not horizontal. When we
                        move $D$ to some intermediate angle, we see that the strongest signal
                        occurs when it is oriented as shown, because although $G$ is vertical,
                        it does not produce a field that is simply parallel to itself—it is
                        the <em class="emph">projection of the acceleration perpendicular to the line of
                            sight</em> that counts. The signal is weaker at $2$ than it is at $1$,
                        because of the projection effect.</p>

                        <p class="p">Now comes an interesting possibility. Suppose we make the charges in
                        $S_1$ and $S_2$ both accelerate up and down, but delay the timing
                        of $S_2$ so that they are $180^\circ$ out of phase. Then the field
                        produced by $S_1$ will be in one direction and the field produced
                        by $S_2$ will be in the opposite direction at any instant, and therefore
                        we should get <em class="emph">no</em> effect at point $1$. The phase of oscillation
                        is neatly adjustable by means of a pipe which is carrying the signal
                        to $S_2$. By changing the length of this pipe we change the time it
                        takes the signal to arrive at $S_2$ and thus we change the phase of
                        that oscillation. By adjusting this length, we can indeed find a place
                        where there is no more signal left, in spite of the fact that both
                        $S_1$ and $S_2$ are moving! The fact that they are both moving can be
                        checked, because if we cut one out, we can see the motion of the
                        other. So the two of them together can produce <em class="emph">zero</em> if
                        everything is adjusted correctly.

                        <p class="p">Now, it is very interesting to show that the addition of the two
                        fields is in fact a <em class="emph">vector</em> addition. We have just checked it
                        for up and down motion, but let us check two nonparallel
                        directions. First, we restore $S_1$ and $S_2$ to the same phase; that
                        is, they are again moving together. But now we turn $S_1$ through
                        $90^\circ$, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch28-F4">28–4</a>. Now we should have at
                        point $1$ the sum of two effects, one of which is vertical and the
                        other horizontal. The electric field is the vector sum of these two
                        in-phase signals—they are both strong at the same time and go
                        through zero together; the total field should be a signal $R$
                        at $45^\circ$. If we turn $D$ to get the maximum noise, it should be at
                        about $45^\circ$, and not vertical. And if we turn it at right angles
                        to that direction, we should get zero, which is easy to
                        measure. Indeed, we observe just such behavior!</p>

                        <p class="p">Now, how about the retardation? How can we demonstrate that the signal
                        is retarded? We could, with a great deal of equipment, measure the
                        time at which it arrives, but there is another, very simple
                        way. Referring again to Fig. <a href="#Ch28-F3">28–3</a>, suppose that $S_1$
                        and $S_2$ are in phase. They are both shaking together, and they
                        produce equal electric fields at point $1$. But suppose we go to a
                        certain place $2$ which is closer to $S_2$ and farther
                        from $S_1$. Then, in accordance with the principle that the acceleration
                        should be retarded by an amount equal to $r/c$, if the retardations
                        are not equal, the signals are no longer in phase. Thus it should be
                        possible to find a position at which the distances of $D$ from $S_1$
                        and $S_2$ differ by some amount $\Delta$, in such a manner that there
                        is no net signal. That is, the distance $\Delta$ is to be the distance
                        light goes in one-half an oscillation of the generator. We may go
                        still further, and find a point where the difference is greater by a
                        whole cycle; that is to say, the signal from the first antenna reaches
                        point $3$ with a delay in time that is greater than that of the second
                        antenna by just the length of time it takes for the electric current
                        to oscillate once, and therefore the two electric fields produced
                        at $3$ are in phase again. At point $3$ the signal is strong again.</p>

                        have not really checked the $1/r$ variation of the electric field
                        strength, or the fact that there is also a magnetic field that goes

                        sophisticated techniques and would hardly add to our understanding at
