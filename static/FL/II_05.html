<span class="tag">5–1</span>Electrostatics is Gauss’ law plus …</h3>
<div id="Ch5-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">There are two laws of electrostatics: that the flux of the electric
field from a volume is proportional to the charge inside—Gauss’ law,
and that the circulation of the electric field is zero—$\FLPE$ is a
gradient. From these two laws, all the predictions of electrostatics
follow. But to say these things mathematically is one thing; to use
them easily, and with a certain amount of ingenuity, is another. In
this chapter we will work through a number of calculations which can
be made with Gauss’ law directly. We will prove theorems and describe
some effects, particularly in conductors, that can be understood very
easily from Gauss’ law. Gauss’ law by itself cannot give the solution
of any problem because the other law must be obeyed too. So when we
use Gauss’ law for the solution of particular problems, we will have
to add something to it. We will have to presuppose, for instance, some
idea of how the field looks—based, for example, on arguments of
symmetry. Or we may have to introduce specifically the idea that the
field is the gradient of a potential.</p>

<div id="Ch5-S2" class="section">
<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">5–2</span>Equilibrium in an electrostatic field</h3>
<div id="Ch5-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Consider first the following question: When can a point charge be in
stable mechanical equilibrium in the electric field of other charges?
As an example, imagine three negative charges at the corners of an
equilateral triangle in a horizontal plane. Would a positive charge
placed at the center of the triangle remain there? (It will be simpler
if we ignore gravity for the moment, although including it would not
change the results.) The force on the positive charge is zero, but is
the equilibrium stable? Would the charge return to the equilibrium
position if displaced slightly? The answer is no.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">There are <em class="emph">no</em> points of stable equilibrium in <em class="emph">any</em>
electrostatic field—except right on top of another charge. Using
Gauss’ law, it is easy to see why. First, for a charge to be in
equilibrium at any particular point $P_0$, the field must be zero.
Second, if the equilibrium is to be a stable one, we require that if
we move the charge away from $P_0$ in <em class="emph">any</em> direction, there
should be a restoring force directed opposite to the displacement. The
electric field at <em class="emph">all</em> nearby points must be pointing
inward—toward the point $P_0$. But that is in violation of Gauss’
law if there is no charge at $P_0$, as we can easily see.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-F1" class="figure">
<img src="img/FLP_II/f05-01/f05-01_tc_big.svgz"><div class="caption">
<span class="tag">Fig. 5–1.</span>If $P_0$ were a position of stable equilibrium for a positive
charge, the electric field everywhere in the neighborhood would
point toward $P_0$.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Consider a tiny imaginary surface that encloses $P_0$, as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F1">5–1</a>. If the electric field everywhere in the vicinity
is pointed toward $P_0$, the surface integral of the normal component is
certainly not zero. For the case shown in the figure, the flux through
the surface must be a negative number. But Gauss’ law says that the flux
of electric field through any surface is proportional to the total
charge inside. If there is no charge at $P_0$, the field we have
imagined violates Gauss’ law. It is impossible to balance a positive
charge in empty space—at a point where there is not some negative
charge. A positive charge <em class="emph">can</em> be in equilibrium if it is in the
middle of a distributed negative charge. Of course, the negative charge
distribution would have to be held in place by other than electrical
forces!</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Our result has been obtained for a point charge. Does the same
conclusion hold for a complicated arrangement of charges held together
in fixed relative positions—with rods, for example? We consider the
question for two equal charges fixed on a rod. Is it possible that
this combination can be in equilibrium in some electrostatic field?
The answer is again no. The <em class="emph">total</em> force on the rod cannot be
restoring for displacements in every direction.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Call $\FLPF$ the total force on the rod in any position—$\FLPF$ is
then a vector field.  Following the argument used above, we conclude
that at a position of stable equilibrium, the divergence of $\FLPF$
must be a negative number. But the total force on the rod is the first
charge times the field at its position, plus the second charge times
the field at its position:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:5:1}
\FLPF=q_1\FLPE_1+q_2\FLPE_2.
\end{equation}

The divergence of $\FLPF$ is given by
\begin{equation*}

If each of the two charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ is in free space, both
$\FLPdiv{\FLPE_1}$ and $\FLPdiv{\FLPE_2}$ are zero,

equilibrium. You can see that an extension of the argument shows that
no rigid combination of any number of charges can have a position of
stable equilibrium in an electrostatic field in free space.</p>

Rutherford and

be radiating energy. They would lose the kinetic energy required to stay

\begin{equation*}

Coulomb’s law then says that
the magnitudes of the fields produced at $P$ by these two surface

\begin{equation*}

like, say, the inverse cube of $r$, that portion of the surface which
is nearer to an interior point would produce a field which is larger
than that which is farther away, resulting in a radial inward field

the electron is attracted to the nucleus by the same inverse square
law? It is true that quantum mechanics must be used for the mechanical
part of the behavior of the electron, but the force is the usual
electrostatic one. In the formulation of the problem, the potential
energy of an electron must be known as a function of distance from the
nucleus, and Coulomb’s law gives a potential which varies inversely
with the first power of the distance.  How accurately is the exponent
known for such small distances? As a result of very careful
measurements in 1947 by Lamb

positions of the energy levels of hydrogen, we know that the exponent
is correct again to one part in a billion on the atomic scale—that

fails at these distances. The electrical force seems to be about $10$
times too weak at distances less than $10^{-14}$ centimeter.  Now
there are two possible explanations. One is that the Coulomb law does
not work at such small distances; the other is that our objects, the
electrons and protons, are not point charges. Perhaps either the
electron or proton, or both, is some kind of a smear. Most physicists
prefer to think that the charge of the proton is smeared. We know that
protons interact strongly with mesons. This implies that a proton
will, from time to time, exist as a neutron with a $\pi^+$ meson
around it. Such a configuration would act—on the average—like a
little sphere of positive charge. We know that the field from a sphere
of charge does not vary as $1/r^2$ all the way into the center. It is

with a sphere it is easier to calculate what the fields <em class="emph">would</em>
be if Coulomb had been wrong), so we take up that subject now. To show
this, it is necessary to know some of the properties of electrical
conductors.</p>

<span class="tag">5–9</span>The fields of a conductor</h3>
<div id="Ch5-S9-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">An electrical conductor is a solid that contains many “free”
electrons. The electrons can move around freely <em class="emph">in</em> the
material, but cannot leave the surface.  In a metal there are so many
free electrons that any electric field will set large numbers of them
into motion. Either the current of electrons so set up must be
continually kept moving by external sources of energy, or the motion
of the electrons will cease as they discharge the sources producing
the initial field. In “electrostatic” situations, we do not consider
continuous sources of current (they will be considered later when we
study magnetostatics), so the electrons move only until they have
arranged themselves to produce zero electric field everywhere inside
the conductor. (This usually happens in a small fraction of a second.)
If there were any field left, this field would urge still more
electrons to move; the only electrostatic solution is that the field
is everywhere zero inside.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S9-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now consider the <em class="emph">interior</em> of a charged conducting object. (By
“interior” we mean in the <em class="emph">metal</em> itself.) Since the metal is a
conductor, the interior field must be zero, and so the gradient of the
potential $\phi$ is zero. That means that $\phi$ does not vary from
point to point. Every conductor is an equipotential <em class="emph">region</em>, and
its surface is an equipotential surface. Since in a conducting
material the electric field is everywhere zero, the divergence
of $\FLPE$ is zero, and by Gauss’ law the charge density in the
<em class="emph">interior</em> of the conductor must be zero.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S9-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">If there can be no charges in a conductor, how can it ever be charged?
What do we mean when we say a conductor is “charged”? Where are the
charges?  The answer is that they reside at the surface of the
conductor, where there are strong forces to keep them from
leaving—they are not completely “free.” When we study solid-state
physics, we shall find that the excess charge of any conductor is on
the average within one or two atomic layers of the surface. For our
present purposes, it is accurate enough to say that if any charge is
put on, or <em class="emph">in</em>, a conductor it all accumulates on the surface;
there is no charge in the interior of a conductor.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S9-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We note also that the electric field <em class="emph">just outside</em> the surface
of a conductor must be normal to the surface. There can be no
tangential component. If there were a tangential component, the
electrons would move <em class="emph">along</em> the surface; there are no forces
preventing that. Saying it another way: we know that the electric
field lines must always go at right angles to an equipotential
surface.</p>

<div id="Ch5-S9-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We can also, using Gauss’ law, relate the field strength just outside
a conductor to the local density of the charge at the surface. For a
gaussian surface, we take a small cylindrical box half inside and half
outside the surface, like the one shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F11">5–11</a>. There
is a contribution to the total flux of $\FLPE$ only from the side of the
box outside the conductor. The field just outside the surface of a
conductor is then
<br><br>
<em class="emph">&emsp;&emsp;Outside a conductor:</em>
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:5:8}
E=\frac{\sigma}{\epsO},
\end{equation}

where $\sigma$ is the <em class="emph">local</em> surface charge density.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S9-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Why does a sheet of charge on a conductor produce a different field
than <em class="emph">just</em> a sheet of charge? In other words, why
is (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII58">5.8</a>) twice as large as (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII53">5.3</a>)? The reason, of
course, is that we have <em class="emph">not</em> said for the conductor that there are
no “other” charges around. There must, in fact, be some to make
$\FLPE=\FLPzero$ in the conductor. The charges in the immediate
neighborhood of a point $P$ on the surface do, in fact, give a field
$E_{\text{local}}=\sigma_{\text{local}}/2\epsO$ both inside and
outside the surface. But all the rest of the charges on the conductor
“conspire” to produce an additional field at the point $P$ equal in
magnitude to $E_{\text{local}}$. The total field inside goes to zero
and the field outside to $2E_{\text{local}}=\sigma/\epsO$.</p>

<span class="tag">5–10</span>The field in a cavity of a conductor</h3>
<div id="Ch5-S10-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We return now to the problem of the hollow container—a conductor
with a cavity. There is no field in the <em class="emph">metal</em>, but what about
in the <em class="emph">cavity</em>? We shall show that if the cavity is <em class="emph">empty</em>
then there are no fields in it, <em class="emph">no matter what the shape</em> of the
conductor or the cavity—say for the one in Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F12">5–12</a>.
Consider a gaussian surface, like $S$ in Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F12">5–12</a>, that
encloses the cavity but stays everywhere in the conducting material.
Everywhere on $S$ the field is zero, so there is no flux through $S$ and
the <em class="emph">total</em> charge inside $S$ is zero. For a spherical shell, one
could then argue from symmetry that there could be <em class="emph">no</em> charge
inside. But, in general, we can only say that there are equal amounts of
positive and negative charge on the inner surface of the conductor.
There <em class="emph">could</em> be a positive surface charge on one part and a
negative one somewhere else, as indicated in Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F12">5–12</a>.
Such a thing cannot be ruled out by Gauss’ law.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-F12" class="figure">
<img src="img/FLP_II/f05-12/f05-12_tc_big.svgz"><div class="caption">
<span class="tag">Fig. 5–12.</span>What is the field in an empty cavity of a conductor, for any
shape?
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S10-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">What really happens, of course, is that any equal and opposite charges
on the inner surface would slide around to meet each other, cancelling
out completely.  We can show that they must cancel completely by using
the law that the circulation of $\FLPE$ is always zero
(electrostatics). Suppose there were charges on some parts of the
inner surface. We know that there would have to be an equal number of
opposite charges somewhere else. Now any lines of $\FLPE$ would have
to start on the positive charges and end on the negative charges
(since we are considering only the case that there are no free charges
in the cavity). Now imagine a loop $\Gamma$ that crosses the cavity
along a line of force from some positive charge to some negative
charge, and returns to its starting point via the conductor (as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch5-F12">5–12</a>). The integral along such a line of force
from the positive to the negative charges would not be zero. The
integral through the metal is zero, since $\FLPE=\FLPzero$. So we
would have
\begin{equation*}
\oint\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs\neq0???
\end{equation*}

But the line integral of $\FLPE$ around any closed loop in an
electrostatic field is always zero. So there can be no fields inside
the empty cavity, nor any charges on the inside surface.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S10-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">You should notice carefully one important qualification we have
made. We have always said “inside an <em class="emph">empty</em>” cavity. If some
charges are <em class="emph">placed</em> at some fixed locations in the cavity—as
on an insulator or on a small conductor insulated from the main
one—then there <em class="emph">can</em> be fields in the cavity. But then that is
not an “empty” cavity.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S10-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We have shown that if a cavity is completely enclosed by a conductor,
no static distribution of charges <em class="emph">outside</em> can ever produce any
fields inside. This explains the principle of “shielding” electrical
equipment by placing it in a metal can. The same arguments can be used
to show that no static distribution of charges <em class="emph">inside</em> a closed
grounded conductor can produce any fields <em class="emph">outside</em>.
Shielding works both ways! In
electrostatics—but not in varying fields—the fields on the two sides
of a closed grounded conducting shell are completely independent.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch5-S10-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now you see why it was possible to check Coulomb’s law to such a great
precision. The shape of the hollow shell used doesn’t matter. It
doesn’t need to be spherical; it could be square! If Gauss’ law is
exact, the field inside is always zero. Now you also understand why it
is safe to sit inside the high-voltage terminal of a million-volt
Van de Graaff generator,
without worrying about getting a shock—because of Gauss’ law.
