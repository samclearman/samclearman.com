<p class="p">In this chapter we are going to discuss why it is that materials are
dielectric. We said in the last chapter that we could understand the
properties of electrical systems with dielectrics once we appreciated
that when an electric field is applied to a dielectric it induces a
dipole moment in the atoms. Specifically, if the electric field $E$
induces an average dipole moment per unit volume $P$, then $\kappa$,
the dielectric constant, is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:1}
\kappa-1=\frac{P}{\epsO E}.
\end{equation}

</div>
<div id="Ch11-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We have already discussed how this equation is applied; now we have to
discuss the mechanism by which polarization arises when there is an
electric field inside a material. We begin with the simplest possible
example—the polarization of gases. But even gases already have
complications: there are two types. The molecules of some gases, like
oxygen, which has a symmetric pair of atoms in each molecule, have no
inherent dipole moment. But the molecules of others, like water vapor
(which has a nonsymmetric arrangement of hydrogen and oxygen atoms)
carry a permanent electric dipole moment. As we pointed out in
Chapter <a href="II_06.html">6</a>, there is in the water vapor molecule an average
plus charge on the hydrogen atoms and a negative charge on the oxygen.
Since the center of gravity of the negative charge and the center of
gravity of the positive charge do not coincide, the total charge
distribution of the molecule has a dipole moment. Such a molecule is
called a <em class="emph">polar</em> molecule. In oxygen, because of the
symmetry of the molecule, the centers of gravity of the positive and
negative charges are the same, so it is a <em class="emph">nonpolar</em>
molecule. It
does, however, become a dipole when placed in an electric field. The
forms of the two types of molecules are sketched in
Fig. <a href="#Ch11-F1">11–1</a>.

<div id="Ch11-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We will first discuss the polarization of non polar molecules. We can
start with the simplest case of a monatomic gas (for instance,
helium). When an atom of such a gas is in an electric field, the
electrons are pulled one way by the field while the nucleus is pulled
the other way, as shown in Fig. <a href="II_10.html#Ch10-F4">10–4</a>. Although the
atoms are very stiff with respect to the electrical forces we can
apply experimentally, there is a slight net displacement of the
centers of charge, and a dipole moment is induced.  For small fields,
the amount of displacement, and so also the dipole moment, is
proportional to the electric field. The displacement of the electron
distribution which produces this kind of induced dipole moment is
called <em class="emph">electronic polarization</em>.</p>

<p class="p">We have already discussed the influence of an electric field on an
atom in Chapter <a href="I_31.html">31</a> of Vol. I, when we were dealing
with the theory of the index of refraction. If you think about it for
a moment, you will see that what we must do now is exactly the same as
we did then. But now we need worry only about fields that do not vary
with time, while the index of refraction depended on time-varying
fields.</p>

<p class="p">In Chapter <a href="I_31.html">31</a> of Vol. I we supposed that when an atom
is placed in an oscillating electric field the center of charge of the
electrons obeys the equation
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:2}
m\,\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+m\omega_0^2x=q_eE.
\end{equation}

The first term is the electron mass times its acceleration and the
second is a restoring force, while the right-hand side is the force
from the outside electric field. If the electric field varies with the
frequency $\omega$, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII112">11.2</a>) has the solution
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:3}
x=\frac{q_eE}{m(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)},
\end{equation}

which has a resonance at $\omega=\omega_0$. When we previously found
this solution, we interpreted it as saying that $\omega_0$ was the
frequency at which light (in the optical region or in the ultraviolet,
depending on the atom) was absorbed. For our purposes, however, we are
interested only in the case of constant fields, i.e., for $\omega=0$,
so we can disregard the acceleration term in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII112">11.2</a>), and
we find that the displacement is

constant $\alpha$ is called the polarizability of the atom, and has the
dimensions $L^3$. It is a measure of how easy it is to induce a moment
in an atom with an electric field. Comparing (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII115">11.5</a>)

</div>
<div id="Ch11-S2-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Our formula is, of course, only a very rough approximation, because in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII112">11.2</a>) we have taken a model which ignores the
complications of quantum mechanics. For example, we have assumed that
an atom has only one resonant frequency, when it really has many. To
calculate properly the polarizability $\alpha$ of atoms we must use
the complete quantum-mechanical theory, but the classical ideas above
give us a reasonable estimate.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S2-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s see if we can get the right order of magnitude for the
dielectric constant of some substance. Suppose we try hydrogen. We
have once estimated (Chapter <a href="I_38.html">38</a>, Vol. I) that the
energy needed to ionize the hydrogen atom should be approximately
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:11}
E\approx\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{me^4}{\hbar^2}.
\end{equation}

For an estimate of the natural frequency $\omega_0$, we can set this
energy equal to $\hbar\omega_0$—the energy of an atomic oscillator
whose natural frequency is $\omega_0$. We get
\begin{equation*}
\omega_0\approx\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{me^4}{\hbar^3}.
\end{equation*}

If we now use this value of $\omega_0$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII117">11.7</a>), we
find for the electronic polarizability
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:12}
\alpha\approx16\pi\biggl[\frac{\hbar^2}{me^2}\biggr]^3.
\end{equation}

The quantity $(\hbar^2/me^2)$ is the radius of the ground-state orbit
of a Bohr atom (see Chapter <a href="I_38.html">38</a>, Vol. I) and equals
$0.528$ angstroms. In a gas at standard pressure and temperature
($1$ atmosphere, $0^\circ$C) there are $2.69\times10^{19}$ atoms/cm$^3$, so
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII119">11.9</a>) gives us
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:13}
\kappa=1+(2.69\times10^{19})16\pi(0.528\times10^{-8})^3=1.00020.

<p class="p">The dielectric constant for hydrogen gas is measured to be
\begin{equation*}
\kappa_{\text{exp}}=1.00026.
\end{equation*}

We see that our theory is about right. We should not expect any
better, because the measurements were, of course, made with normal
hydrogen gas, which has diatomic molecules, not single atoms. We
should not be surprised if the polarization of the atoms in a molecule
is not quite the same as that of the separate atoms.  The molecular
effect, however, is not really that large. An exact quantum-mechanical
calculation of $\alpha$ for hydrogen atoms gives a result about
$12\%$ higher than (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1112">11.12</a>) (the $16\pi$ is changed to $18\pi$),
and therefore predicts a dielectric constant somewhat closer to the
observed one. In any case, it is clear that our model of a dielectric
is fairly good.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S2-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">Another check on our theory is to try Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII117">11.7</a>) on
atoms which have a higher frequency of excitation. For instance, it
takes about $24.6$ electron volts to pull the electron off helium, compared
with the $13.6$ electron volts required to ionize hydrogen.  We would,
therefore, expect that the absorption frequency $\omega_0$ for helium
would be about twice as big as for hydrogen and that $\alpha$ would be
one-quarter as large. So, from (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1113">11.13</a>) we expect that
\begin{equation*}
\kappa_{\text{helium}}\approx1.000050.
\end{equation*}

Experimentally,
\begin{equation*}
\kappa_{\text{helium}}=1.000068,
\end{equation*}

so you see that our rough estimates are coming out on the right
track. So we have understood the dielectric constant of nonpolar gas,
but only qualitatively, because we have not yet used a correct atomic
theory of the motions of the atomic electrons.</p>

<p class="p">Next we will consider a molecule which carries a permanent dipole
moment $p_0$—such as a water molecule. With no electric field, the
individual dipoles point in random directions, so the net moment per
unit volume is zero. But when an electric field is applied, two things
happen: First, there is an extra dipole moment induced because of the
forces on the electrons; this part gives just the same kind of
electronic polarizability we found for a nonpolar molecule. For very
accurate work, this effect should, of course, be included, but we will
neglect it for the moment. (It can always be added in at the end.)
Second, the electric field tends to line up the individual dipoles to
produce a net moment per unit volume. If all the dipoles in a gas were
to line up, there would be a very large polarization, but that does
not happen. At ordinary temperatures and electric fields the
collisions of the molecules in their thermal motion keep them from
lining up very much. But there is some net alignment, and so some
polarization (see Fig. <a href="#Ch11-F2">11–2</a>). The polarization that
does occur can be computed by the methods of statistical mechanics we

energy $U$ is proportional to
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:15}

there will be a net dipole moment per unit volume—that is, a
polarization $P$. To calculate $P$, we want the vector sum of all the
molecular moments in a unit volume. Since we know that the result is
going to be in the direction of $\FLPE$, we will just sum the
components in that direction (the components at right angles

The polarization is proportional to the field $E$, so there will be
normal dielectric behavior. Also, as we expect, the polarization
depends inversely on the temperature, because at higher temperatures
there is more disalignment by collisions. This $1/T$ dependence is
called Curie’s law. The permanent
moment $p_0$ appears squared for the following reason: In a given

moment that is produced by the lining up is again proportional to $p_0$.

electric field varies very, very rapidly from point to point in the
liquid. It is very high inside the atoms—particularly right next to
the nucleus—and relatively small between the atoms. The potential
difference between the plates is the line integral of this total

an <em class="emph">average</em> electric field $E$, which is just $V/d$. (This is

<p class="p">Earlier in the history of physics, when it was supposed to be very
important to define every quantity by direct experiment, people were
delighted to discover that they could define what they meant by $E$
and $D$ in a dielectric without having to crawl around between the
atoms. The average field $\FLPE$ is numerically equal to the
field $\FLPE_0$ that would be measured in a slot cut parallel to the
field. And the field $\FLPD$ could be measured by finding $E_0$ in a
slot cut normal to the field. But nobody ever measures them that way
anyway, so it was just one of those philosophical things.</p>

<p class="p">For most liquids which are not too complicated in structure, we could
expect that an atom finds itself, on the average, surrounded by the
other atoms in what would be a good approximation to a <em class="emph">spherical
hole</em>. And so we should ask: “What would be the field in a spherical
hole?” We can find out by noticing that if we imagine carving out a
spherical hole in a uniformly polarized material, we are just removing
a sphere of polarized material. (We must imagine that the polarization
is “frozen in” before we cut out the hole.) By superposition,
however, the fields inside the dielectric, before the sphere was
removed, is the sum of the fields from all charges outside the
spherical volume plus the fields from the charges within the polarized
sphere. That is, if we call $E$ the field in the uniform dielectric,
we can write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:23}
E=E_{\text{hole}}+E_{\text{plug}},
\end{equation}

where $E_{\text{hole}}$ is the field in the hole and $E_{\text{plug}}$
is the field inside a sphere which is uniformly polarized (see
Fig. <a href="#Ch11-F6">11–6</a>). The fields due to a uniformly polarized sphere
are shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch11-F7">11–7</a>. The electric field inside the
sphere is uniform, and its value is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:24}
E_{\text{plug}}=-\frac{P}{3\epsO}.
\end{equation}

Using (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1123">11.23</a>), we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:25}
E_{\text{hole}}=E+\frac{P}{3\epsO}.
\end{equation}

The field in a spherical cavity is greater than the average field by
the amount $P/3\epsO$. (The spherical hole gives a field $1/3$ of the
way between a slot parallel to the field and a slot perpendicular to
the field.)</p>

Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1129">11.29</a>). For instance, for carbon disulfide at zero
degrees centigrade the dielectric constant is $1.0029$, so $N\alpha$
is $0.0029$. Now the density of the gas is easily worked out and the
density of the liquid can be found in handbooks. At $20^\circ$C, the
density of liquid CS$_2$ is $381$ times higher than the density of the
gas at $0^\circ$C. This means that $N$ is $381$ times higher in the
liquid than it is in the gas so, that—if we make the approximation
that the basic atomic polarizability of the carbon disulfide doesn’t
change when it is condensed into a liquid—$N\alpha$ in the liquid is
equal to $381$ times $0.0029$, or $1.11$. Notice that the $N\alpha/3$

<div id="Ch11-S6-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we turn to the solids. The first interesting fact about solids is
that there can be a permanent polarization built in—which exists
even without applying an electric field. An example occurs with a
material like wax, which contains long molecules having a permanent
dipole moment. If you melt some wax and put a strong electric field on
it when it is a liquid, so that the dipole moments get partly lined
up, they will stay that way when the liquid freezes. The solid
material will have a permanent polarization which remains when the
field is removed. Such a solid is called an <em class="emph">electret</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">An electret has permanent polarization charges on its surface.
It is
the electrical analog of a magnet. It is not as useful, though,
because free charges from the air are attracted to its surfaces,
eventually cancelling the polarization charges. The electret is
“discharged” and there are no visible external fields.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">A permanent internal polarization $P$ is also found occurring
naturally in some crystalline substances. In such crystals, each unit
cell of the lattice has an identical permanent dipole moment, as drawn
in Fig. <a href="#Ch11-F8">11–8</a>. All the dipoles point in the same
direction, even with no applied electric field. Many complicated
crystals have, in fact, such a polarization; we do not normally notice
it because the external fields are discharged, just as for the
electrets.</p>

<div id="Ch11-S6-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">If these internal dipole moments of a crystal are changed, however,
external fields appear because there is not time for stray charges to
gather and cancel the polarization charges. If the dielectric is in a
condenser, free charges will be induced on the electrodes. For
example, the moments can change when a dielectric is heated, because
of thermal expansion. The effect is called
<em class="emph">pyroelectricity</em>. Similarly, if we change
the stresses in a crystal—for instance, if we bend it—again the
moment may change a little bit, and a small electrical effect, called
<em class="emph">piezoelectricity</em>, can be detected.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S6-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">For crystals that do not have a permanent moment, one can work out a
theory of the dielectric constant that involves the electronic
polarizability of the atoms.  It goes much the same as for
liquids. Some crystals also have rotatable dipoles inside, and the
rotation of these dipoles will also contribute to $\kappa$. In ionic
crystals such as NaCl there is also <em class="emph">ionic
polarizability</em>. The crystal consists of a
checkerboard of positive and negative ions, and in an electric field the
positive ions are pulled one way and the negatives the other; there is a
net relative motion of the plus and minus charges, and so a volume
polarization. We could estimate the magnitude of the ionic
polarizability from our knowledge of the stiffness
of salt crystals, but
we will not go into that subject here.

<p class="p">We want to describe now one special class of crystals which have, just
by accident almost, a built-in permanent moment. The situation is so
marginal that if we increase the temperature a little bit they lose
the permanent moment completely. On the other hand, if they are nearly
cubic crystals, so that their moments can be turned in different
directions, we can detect a large change in the moment when an applied
electric field is changed. All the moments flip over and we get a
large effect. Substances which have this kind of permanent moment are
called <em class="emph">ferroelectric</em>, after the corresponding ferromagnetic
effects which were first discovered in iron.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S7-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We would like to explain how ferroelectricity works by describing a
particular example of a ferroelectric material. There are several ways
in which the ferroelectric property can originate; but we will take up
only one mysterious case—that of barium titanate, BaTiO$_3$. This
material has a crystal lattice whose basic cell is sketched in
Fig. <a href="#Ch11-F9">11–9</a>. It turns out that above a certain temperature,
specifically $118^\circ$C, barium titanate is an ordinary dielectric
with an enormous dielectric constant. Below this temperature, however,
it suddenly takes on a permanent moment.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch11-S7-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">In working out the polarization of solid material, we must first find
what are the local fields in each unit cell. We must include the
fields from the polarization itself, just as we did for the case of a
liquid. But a crystal is not a homogeneous liquid, so we cannot use
for the local field what we would get in a spherical hole. If you work
it out for a crystal, you find that the factor $1/3$ in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1124">11.24</a>) becomes slightly different, but not far
from $1/3$. (For a simple cubic crystal, it is just $1/3$.) We will,
therefore, assume for our preliminary discussion that the factor
is $1/3$ for BaTiO$_3$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S7-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Now when we wrote Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1128">11.28</a>) you may have wondered what
would happen if $N\alpha$ became greater than $3$. It appears as
though $\kappa$ would become negative. But that surely cannot be
right. Let’s see what should happen if we were gradually to
increase $\alpha$ in a particular crystal. As $\alpha$ gets larger, the
polarization gets bigger, making a bigger local field. But a bigger
local field will polarize each atom more, raising the local fields
still more. If the “give” of the atoms is enough, the process keeps
going; there is a kind of feedback that causes the polarization to
increase without limit—assuming that the polarization of each atom
increases in proportion to the field. The “runaway” condition occurs
when $N\alpha=3$. The polarization does not become infinite, of
course, because the proportionality between the induced moment and the
electric field breaks down at high fields, so that our formulas are no
longer correct. What happens is that the lattice gets “locked in”
with a high, self-generated, internal polarization.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S7-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">In the case of BaTiO$_3$, there is, in addition to an electronic
polarization, also a rather large ionic polarization, presumed to be
due to titanium ions which can move a little within the cubic
lattice. The lattice resists large motions, so after the titanium has
gone a little way, it jams up and stops. But the crystal cell is then
left with a permanent dipole moment.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S7-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">In most crystals, this is really the situation for all temperatures
that can be reached. The very interesting thing about barium titanate
is that there is such a delicate condition that if $N\alpha$ is
decreased just a little bit it comes unstuck. Since $N$ decreases with
increasing temperature—because of thermal expansion—we can
vary $N\alpha$ by varying the temperature. Below the critical temperature
it is just barely stuck, so it is easy—by applying an external
field—to shift the polarization and have it lock in a different
direction.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S7-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s see if we can analyze what happens in more detail. We call $T_c$
the critical temperature at which $N\alpha$ is exactly $3$. As the
temperature increases, $N$ goes down a little bit because of the
expansion of the lattice. Since the expansion is small, we can say
that near the critical temperature
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:30}
N\alpha=3-\beta(T-T_c),
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ is a small constant, of the same order of magnitude as
the thermal expansion coefficient, or about $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-6}$ per
degree C. Now if we substitute this relation into
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1128">11.28</a>), we get that
\begin{equation*}
\kappa-1=\frac{3-\beta(T-T_c)}{\beta(T-T_c)/3}.
\end{equation*}

Since we have assumed that $\beta(T-T_c)$ is small compared with one,
we can approximate this formula by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:31}
\kappa-1=\frac{9}{\beta(T-T_c)}.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S7-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">This relation is right, of course, only for $T&gt;T_c$. We see that just
above the critical temperature $\kappa$ is enormous. Because $N\alpha$
is so close to $3$, there is a tremendous magnification effect, and
the dielectric constant can easily be as high as $50{,}000$
to $100{,}000$. It is also very sensitive to temperature. For increases
in temperature, the dielectric constant goes down inversely as the
temperature, but, unlike the case of a dipolar gas, for
which $\kappa-1$ goes inversely as the <em class="emph">absolute</em> temperature, for
ferroelectrics it varies inversely as the difference between the
absolute temperature and the critical temperature (this law is called
the Curie-Weiss law).

</div>
<div id="Ch11-S7-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">When we lower the temperature to the critical temperature, what happens?
If we imagine a lattice of unit cells like that in
Fig. <a href="#Ch11-F9">11–9</a>, we see that it is possible to pick out chains of
ions along vertical lines. One of them consists of alternating oxygen
and titanium ions. There are other lines made up of either barium or
oxygen ions, but the spacing along these lines is greater. We make a
simple model to imitate this situation by imagining, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch11-F10">11–10</a>(a), a series of chains of ions. Along what we
call the main chain, the separation of the ions is $a$, which is
<em class="emph">half</em> the lattice constant; the lateral distance between identical
chains is $2a$. There are less-dense chains in between which we will
ignore for the moment. To make the analysis a little easier, we will
also suppose that all the ions on the main chain are identical. (It is
not a serious simplification because all the important effects will
still appear. This is one of the tricks of theoretical physics. One does
a different problem because it is easier to figure out the first
time—then when one understands how the thing works, it is time to put
in all the complications.)</p>

<div id="Ch11-S7-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let’s try to find out what would happen with our model. We suppose
that the dipole moment of each atom is $p$ and we wish to calculate
the field at one of the atoms of the chain. We must find the sum of
the fields from all the other atoms.  We will first calculate the
field from the dipoles in only one vertical chain; we will talk about
the other chains later. The field at the distance $r$ from a dipole in
a direction along its axis is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:32}
E=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO}\,\frac{2p}{r^3}.
\end{equation}

At any given atom, the dipoles at equal distances above and below it
give fields in the same direction, so for the whole chain we get
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:11:33}
E_{\text{chain}}=\frac{p}{4\pi\epsO}\,\frac{2}{a^3}\cdot
\biggl(2+\frac{2}{8}+\frac{2}{27}+\frac{2}{64}+\dotsb\biggr)=
\frac{p}{\epsO}\,\frac{0.383}{a^3}.
\end{equation}
</span>
<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{align}
E_{\text{chain}}&=\frac{p}{4\pi\epsO}\,\frac{2}{a^3}\cdot
\biggl(2+\frac{2}{8}+\frac{2}{27}+\frac{2}{64}+\dotsb\biggr)\notag\\[1.5ex]
\label{Eq:II:11:33}
&=\;\,\frac{p}{\epsO}\,\frac{0.383}{a^3}.
\end{align}
</span>

It is not too hard to show that if our model were like a completely
cubic crystal—that is, if the next identical lines were only the
distance $a$ away—the number $0.383$ would be changed to $1/3$. In
other words, if the next lines were at the distance $a$ they would
contribute only $-0.050$ unit to our sum. However, the next main chain
we are considering is at the distance $2a$ and, as you remember from
Chapter <a href="II_07.html">7</a>, the field from a periodic structure dies off
exponentially with distance. Therefore these lines contribute much
less than $-0.050$ and we can just ignore all the other chains.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S7-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">It is necessary now to find out what polarizability $\alpha$ is needed
to make the runaway process work. Suppose that the induced moment $p$
of each atom of the chain is proportional to the field on it, as in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII116">11.6</a>). We get the polarizing field on the atom
from $E_{\text{chain}}$ using Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1132">11.32</a>). So we have the two
equations
\begin{equation*}
p=\alpha\epsO E_{\text{chain}}
\end{equation*}

and
\begin{equation*}
E_{\text{chain}}=\frac{0.383}{a^3}\,\frac{p}{\epsO}.
\end{equation*}

There are two solutions: $E_{\text{chain}}$ and $p$ both zero, or
\begin{equation*}
\alpha=\frac{a^3}{0.383},
\end{equation*}

with $E_{\text{chain}}$ and $p$ both finite. Thus if $\alpha$ is as
large as $a^3/0.383$, a permanent polarization sustained by its own
field will set in. This critical equality must be reached for barium
titanate at just the temperature $T_c$. (Notice that if $\alpha$ were
larger than the critical value for small fields, it would decrease at
larger fields and at equilibrium the same equality we have found would

<p class="p">For BaTiO$_3$, the spacing $a$ is $2\times10^{-8}$ cm, so we must
expect that $\alpha=21.8\times10^{-24}$ cm$^3$. We can compare this
with the known polarizabilities of the individual atoms. For oxygen,
$\alpha=30.2\times10^{-24}$ cm$^3$; we’re on the right track! But for
titanium, $\alpha=2.4\times10^{-24}$ cm$^3$; rather small. To use our
model we should probably take the average. (We could work out the
chain again for alternating atoms, but the result would be about the
same.) So $\alpha(\text{average})=16.3\times10^{-24}$ cm$^3$, which is
not high enough to give a permanent polarization.</p>

<div id="Ch11-S7-p13" class="para">
<p class="p">But wait a moment! We have so far only added up the electronic
polarizabilities. There is also some ionic polarization due to the
motion of the titanium ion. All we need is an ionic polarizability
of $9.2\times10^{-24}$ cm$^3$. (A more precise computation using
alternating atoms shows that actually $11.9\times10^{-24}$ cm$^3$ is
needed.) To understand the properties of BaTiO$_3$, we have to assume
that such an ionic polarizability exists.

<p class="p">Why the titanium ion in barium titanate should have that much ionic
polarizability is not known. Furthermore, why, at a lower temperature,
it polarizes along the cube diagonal and the face diagonal equally
well is not clear. If we figure out the actual size of the spheres in
Fig. <a href="#Ch11-F9">11–9</a>, and ask whether the titanium is a little bit
loose in the box formed by its neighboring oxygen atoms—which is
what you would hope, so that it could be easily shifted—you find
quite the contrary. It fits very tightly. The <em class="emph">barium</em> atoms are
slightly loose, but if you let them be the ones that move, it doesn’t
work out. So you see that the subject is really not one-hundred
percent clear; there are still mysteries we would like to understand.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch11-S7-p15" class="para">
<p class="p">Returning to our simple model of Fig. <a href="#Ch11-F10">11–10</a>(a), we see
that the field from one chain would tend to polarize the neighboring
chain in the <em class="emph">opposite</em> direction, which means that although each
chain would be locked, there would be no net permanent moment per unit
volume!  (Although there would be no external electric effects, there
are still certain thermodynamic effects one could observe.) Such
systems exist, and are called antiferroelectric. So what we have
explained is really an antiferroelectric. Barium titanate, however, is
really like the arrangement in Fig. <a href="#Ch11-F10">11–10</a>(b). The
oxygen-titanium chains are all polarized in the same direction because
there are intermediate chains of atoms in between. Although the atoms
in these chains are not very polarizable, or very dense, they will be
somewhat polarized, in the direction antiparallel to the
oxygen-titanium chains. The small fields produced at the next
oxygen-titanium chain will get it started parallel to the first. So
BaTiO$_3$ is really ferroelectric, and it is because of the atoms in
between.  You may be wondering: “But what about the direct effect
between the two O-Ti chains?” Remember, though, the direct effect
dies off exponentially with the separation; the effect of the chain of
<em class="emph">strong</em> dipoles at $2a$ can be less than the effect of a chain
of weak ones at the distance $a$.</p>
