<p class="p">In Chapter <a href="III_13.html">13</a> we worked out the theory for the
propagation of an electron or of some other “particle,” such as an
atomic excitation, through a crystal lattice. In the last chapter we
applied the theory to semiconductors. But when we talked about
situations in which there are many electrons we disregarded any
interactions between them. To do this is of course only an
approximation. In this chapter we will discuss further the idea that
you can disregard the interaction between the electrons. We will also
use the opportunity to show you some more applications of the theory
of the propagation of particles. Since we will generally continue to
disregard the interactions between particles, there is very little
really new in this chapter except for the new applications. The first
example to be considered is, however, one in which it is possible to
write down quite exactly the correct equations when there is more than
one “particle” present. From them we will be able to see how the
approximation of disregarding the interactions is made. We will not,
though, analyze the problem very carefully.</p>

<p class="p">As our first example we will consider a “spin wave” in a ferromagnetic
crystal. We have discussed the theory of ferromagnetism in
Chapter <a href="II_36.html">36</a> of Volume II. At zero temperature all the
electron spins that contribute to the magnetism in the body of a
ferromagnetic crystal are parallel. There is an interaction energy
between the spins, which is lowest when all the spins are down. At any
nonzero temperature, however, there is some chance that some of the
spins are turned over. We calculated the probability in an approximate
manner in Chapter <a href="II_36.html">36</a>. This time we will describe the
quantum mechanical theory—so you will see what you would have to do if
you wanted to solve the problem more exactly. (We will still make some
idealizations by assuming that the electrons are localized at the atoms
and that the spins interact only with neighboring spins.)</p>

<div id="Ch15-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We consider a model in which the electrons at each atom are all paired
except one, so that all of the magnetic effects come from one

corresponds roughly to metallic nickel.

<div id="Ch15-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We also assume that there is an interaction between any two adjacent

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:15:1}
E=-\sum_{i,j}K\FLPsigma_i\cdot\FLPsigma_j,
\end{equation}

where $\FLPsigma$’s represent the spins and the summation is over all
adjacent pairs of electrons. We have already discussed this kind of
interaction energy when we considered the hyperfine splitting of
hydrogen due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the
electron and proton in a hydrogen atom. We expressed it then
as $A\FLPsigma_{\text{e}}\cdot\FLPsigma_{\text{p}}$. Now, for a given
pair, say the electrons at atom $4$ and at atom $5$, the Hamiltonian
would be $-K\FLPsigma_4\cdot\FLPsigma_5$. We have a term for each such
pair, and the Hamiltonian is (as you would expect for classical
energies) the sum of these terms for each interacting pair. The energy
is written with the factor $-K$ so that a positive $K$ will correspond
to ferromagnetism—that is, the lowest energy results when adjacent
spins are parallel. In a real crystal, there may be other terms which
are the interactions of <em class="emph">next</em> nearest neighbors, and so on, but
we don’t need to consider such complications at this stage.</p>

<p class="p">With the Hamiltonian of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII151">15.1</a>) we have a complete

able to calculate the thermodynamic properties due to the
magnetization. If we can find all the energy levels, the properties of
the crystal at a temperature $T$ can be found from the principle that
the probability that a system will be found in a given state of
energy $E$ is proportional to $e^{-E/\kappa T}$. This problem has never been
completely solved.</p>

<p class="p">We will show some of the problems by taking a simple example in which
all the atoms are in a line—a one-dimensional lattice. You can
easily extend the ideas to three dimensions. At each atomic location
there is an electron which has two possible states, either spin up or
spin down, and the whole system is described by telling how all of the
spins are arranged. We take the Hamiltonian of the system to be the
operator of the interaction energy. Interpreting the spin vectors of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII151">15.1</a>) as the sigma-operators—or the
sigma-matrices—we write for the linear lattice
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:15:2}
\Hop=\sum_n-\frac{A}{2}\,\FLPsigmaop_n\cdot\FLPsigmaop_{n+1}.
\end{equation}

In this equation we have written the constant as $A/2$ for convenience
(so that some of the later equations will be exactly the same as the
ones in Chapter <a href="III_13.html">13</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Now what is the lowest state of this system? The state of lowest
energy is the one in which all the spins are parallel—let’s say, all
up.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> We can write
this state as $\ket{\dotsb+\,+\,+\,+\dotsb}$, or $\ket{\text{gnd}}$
for the “ground,” or lowest, state. It’s easy to figure out the
energy for this state. One way is to write out all the vector sigmas
in terms of $\sigmaop_x$, $\sigmaop_y$, and $\sigmaop_z$, and work
through carefully what each term of the Hamiltonian does to the ground
state, and then add the results. We can, however, also use a good
short cut. We saw in Section <a href="III_12.html#Ch12-S2">12–2</a>, that
$\FLPsigmaop_i\cdot\FLPsigmaop_j$ could be written in terms of the
Pauli spin exchange operator
like this:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:15:3}
\FLPsigmaop_i\cdot\FLPsigmaop_j=(2\Pop^{\text{spin ex}}_{ij}-1),
\end{equation}

where the operator $\Pop^{\text{spin ex}}_{ij}$ interchanges the spins
of the $i$th and $j$th electrons. With this substitution the
Hamiltonian becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:15:4}
\Hop=-A\sum_n(\Pop^{\text{spin ex}}_{n,n+1}-\tfrac{1}{2}).
\end{equation}

It is now easy to work out what happens to different states. For
instance if $i$ and $j$ are both up, then exchanging the spins leaves
everything unchanged, so $\Pop_{ij}$ acting on the state just gives
the same state back, and is equivalent to multiplying by $+1$. The
expression $(\Pop_{ij}-\tfrac{1}{2})$ is just equal to one-half. (From
now on we will leave off the descriptive superscript on the $\Pop$.)
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">For the ground state all spins are up; so if you exchange a particular
pair of spins, you get back the original state. The ground state is a
stationary state. If you operate on it with the Hamiltonian you get
the same state again multiplied by a sum of terms, $-(A/2)$ for each
pair of spins. That is, the energy of the system in the ground state
is $-A/2$ per atom.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Next we would like to look at the energies of some of the excited
states. It will be convenient to measure the energies with respect to
the ground state—that is, to choose the ground state as our zero of
energy. We can do that by adding the energy $A/2$ to each term in the
Hamiltonian. That just changes the “$\tfrac{1}{2}$” in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII154">15.4</a>) to “$1$.” Our new Hamiltonian is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:15:5}
\Hop=-A\sum_n(\Pop_{n,n+1}-1).
\end{equation}

With this Hamiltonian the energy of the lowest state is zero; the spin
exchange operator is equivalent to multiplying by unity (for the
ground state) which is cancelled by the “$1$” in each term.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">For describing states other than the ground state we will need a
suitable set of base states. One convenient approach is to group the
states according to whether one electron has spin down, or two
electrons have spin down, and so on. There are, of course, many states
with one spin down. The down spin could be at atom “4,” or at
atom “5,” or at atom “6,” … We can, in fact, choose just such
states for our base states. We could write them this way:
$\ket{4}$, $\ket{5}$, $\ket{6}$, … It will, however, be more convenient
later if we label the “odd atom”—the one with the down-spinning
electron—by its coordinate $x$. That is, we’ll define the
state $\ket{x_5}$ to be one with all the electrons spinning up except for
the one on the atom at $x_5$, which has a down-spinning electron (see
Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F1">15–1</a>). In general, $\ket{x_n}$ is the state with one down
spin
that is located at the coordinate $x_n$ of the $n$th atom.</p>

<p class="p">What is the action of the Hamiltonian (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII155">15.5</a>) on the

say $-A(\Pop_{7,8}-1)$. The operator $\Pop_{7,8}$ exchanges the two spins
of the adjacent atoms $7$, $8$. But in the state $\ket{x_5}$ these are
both up, and nothing happens; $\Pop_{7,8}$ is equivalent to
multiplying by $1$:
\begin{equation*}
\Pop_{7,8}\,\ket{x_5}=\ket{x_5}.
\end{equation*}
It follows that
\begin{equation*}
(\Pop_{7,8}-1)\,\ket{x_5}=0.
\end{equation*}
Thus all the terms of the Hamiltonian give zero—except those
involving atom $5$, of course. On the state $\ket{x_5}$, the
operation $\Pop_{4,5}$ exchanges the spin of atom $4$ (up) and atom $5$
(down). The result is the state with all spins up except the atom
at $4$. That is
\begin{equation*}
\Pop_{4,5}\,\ket{x_5}=\ket{x_4}.

<p class="p">When the Hamiltonian acts on state $\ket{x_5}$ it gives rise to some

that there is a certain amplitude to have the down spin jump over to
the next atom. So because of the interaction between the spins, if we
begin with one spin down, then there is some probability that at a
later time another one will be down instead. Operating on the general
state $\ket{x_n}$, the Hamiltonian gives
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:15:7}
\Hop\,\ket{x_n}=-A\{\ket{x_{n+1}}+\ket{x_{n-1}}-2\,\ket{x_n}\}.

Notice particularly that if we take a complete set of states with only
one spin down, they will only be mixed among themselves. The
Hamiltonian will never mix these states with others that have more
spins down. So long as you only exchange spins you never change the
total number of down spins.

Just as before, we can consider a localized wave packet (containing,

spins. Again we pick a set of base states. We’ll choose states in
which there are down spins at two atomic locations, such as the state
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F2">15–2</a>. We can label such a state by the
$x$-coordinates
of the two sites with down spins. The one shown can be
called $\ket{x_2,x_5}$. In general the base states are $\ket{x_n,x_m}$—a
doubly infinite set! In this system of description, the
state $\ket{x_4,x_9}$ and the state $\ket{x_9,x_4}$ are exactly the same
state, because each simply says that there is a down spin at $4$ and
one at $9$; there is no meaning to the order. Furthermore, the
state $\ket{x_4,x_4}$ has no meaning, there isn’t such a thing. We can
describe any state $\ket{\psi}$ by giving the amplitudes to be in each
of the base states. Thus $C_{m,n}=\braket{x_m,x_n}{\psi}$ now means
the amplitude for a system in the state $\ket{\psi}$ to be in a state
in which both the $m$th and $n$th atoms have a down spin. The
complications which now arise are not complications of ideas—they
are merely complexities in bookkeeping. (One of the complexities of
quantum mechanics is just the bookkeeping. With more and more down
spins, the notation becomes more and more elaborate with lots of

the $C_{m,n}$ can be replaced by the coefficients $a_{m,n}$. Next we
have to work out carefully the effect of $H$ on a state with spins $m$

$m$ and $n$ are far enough apart so that we don’t have to worry about
the obvious trouble. The operation of exchange at the location $x_n$
will move the down spin either to the $(n+1)$ or $(n-1)$ atom, and so
there’s an amplitude that the present state has come from the

\end{equation}

Now, given any $k_1$ and $k_2$ the amplitude $C_{m,n}$ is independent
of which way we put $x_m$ and $x_n$—if we should happen to define
$x_m$ and $x_n$ reversed we get the same amplitude. Our interpretation
of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1524">15.24</a>) in terms of “magnons” must also be
different. We can no longer say that the equation represents
<em class="emph">one</em> particle with wave number $k_1$ and a <em class="emph">second</em> particle
with wave number $k_2$. The amplitude (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1524">15.24</a>) represents
<em class="emph">one</em> state with two particles (magnons). The <em class="emph">state</em> is
characterized by the two wave numbers $k_1$ and $k_2$. Our solution
looks like a compound state of one particle with the
momentum $p_1=\hbar k_1$ and another particle with the momentum $p_2=\hbar
k_2$, but in our state we can’t say which particle is which.</p>

<div id="Ch15-S3-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">By now, this discussion should remind you of Chapter <a href="III_04.html">4</a>
and our story of identical particles. We have just been showing that the
particles of the spin waves—the magnons—behave like identical
Bose particles. All amplitudes must
be symmetric in the coordinates of the two particles—which is the same
as saying that if we “interchange the two particles,” we get back the
same amplitude and with the same sign. But, you may be thinking, why did
we choose to <em class="emph">add</em> the two terms in making
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1524">15.24</a>). Why not subtract? With a minus sign,
interchanging $x_m$ and $x_n$ would just change the sign of $a_{m,n}$
which doesn’t matter. But interchanging $x_m$ and $x_n$ <em class="emph">doesn’t
change anything</em>—all the electrons of the crystal are exactly where
they were before, so there is no reason for even the sign of the
amplitude to change. The magnons will behave like Bose
particles.<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a></p>

<div id="Ch15-S3-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">The main points of this discussion have been twofold: First, to show
you something about spin waves, and, second, to demonstrate a state
whose amplitude is a <em class="emph">product</em> of two amplitudes, and whose
energy is the <em class="emph">sum</em> of the energies corresponding to the two
amplitudes. For <em class="emph">independent particles</em> the amplitude is the
product and the energy is the sum. You can easily see why the energy
is the sum. The energy is the coefficient of $t$ in an imaginary
exponential—it is proportional to the frequency. If two objects are
doing something, one of them with the amplitude $e^{-iE_1t/\hbar}$ and
the other with the amplitude $e^{-iE_2t/\hbar}$, and if the amplitude
for the two things to happen together is the product of the amplitudes
for each, then there is a single frequency in the product which is the
sum of the two frequencies. The energy corresponding to the amplitude
product is the sum of the two energies.</p>

<div id="Ch15-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We have gone through a rather long-winded argument to tell you a
simple thing. When you don’t take into account any interaction between
particles, you can think of each particle independently. They can
individually exist in the various different states they would have
alone, and they will each contribute the energy they would have had if
they were alone. However, you must remember that if they are identical
particles, they may behave either as Bose or as Fermi
particles depending upon the problem. Two
extra electrons added to a crystal, for instance, would have to behave
like Fermi particles. When the
positions of two electrons are interchanged, the amplitude must reverse
sign. In the equation corresponding to Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1524">15.24</a>) there
would have to be a minus sign between the two terms on the right. As a
consequence, two Fermi particles
cannot be in exactly the same condition—with equal spins and
equal $k$’s. The amplitude for this state is zero.

to
the carbon at each location. With the conventional picture of valence
bonds it is necessary to assume double bonds between half of the
carbon atoms, and in the lowest energy condition there are the two
possibilities shown in the figure. There are also other, higher-energy
states. When we discussed benzene in Chapter <a href="III_10.html">10</a>, we just
took the two states and forgot all the rest. We found that the

<p class="p">Now we’re going to look at the same molecule from a completely different
point of view—using a different kind of approximation. The two points

the usual situation, then you should not be surprised if the two
descriptions do not agree exactly. We shall at least show that also with
the new point-of-view the lowest energy of the benzene molecule is lower

for a pair of electrons—so we have a six-times ionized benzene
molecule. Now we will consider what happens when we put back the six
electrons one at a time, imagining that each one can run freely around
the ring. We assume also that all the bonds shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F4">15–4</a> are

and furthermore when they are both at the same site, they must have
considerably different energy than twice the energy for one being
there. Certainly the approximation of independent particles is not
legitimate when there are only six sites—particularly when we want

simpler example—the ethylene molecule which
contains just two carbon atoms with two hydrogen atoms on either side as
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F5">15–5</a>. This molecule has one “extra” bond
involving two electrons between the two carbon atoms. Now remove one of
these electrons; what do we have? We can look at it as a two-state
system—the remaining electron can be at one carbon or the other. We
can analyze it as a two-state system. The possible energies for the
single electron are either $(E_0-A)$ or $(E_0+A)$, as shown in

<p class="p">Now add the second electron. Good, if we have two electrons, we can
put the first one in the lower state and the second one in the
upper. Not quite; we forgot something. Each one of the states is
really double. When we say there’s a possible state with the
energy $(E_0-A)$, there are really two. Two electrons can go into the same
state if one has its spin up and the other, its spin down. (No more
can be put in because of the exclusion principle.) So there really are
two possible states of energy $(E_0-A)$. We can draw a diagram, as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F7">15–7</a>, which indicates both the energy levels and their
occupancy. In the condition of lowest energy both electrons will be in
the lowest state with their spins opposite. The energy of the extra
bond in the ethylene molecule therefore is $2(E_0-A)$ if we neglect
the interaction between the two electrons.</p>

<p class="p">Let’s go back to the benzene. Each of the two states of Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F3">15–3</a>
has three double bonds. Each of these is just like the bond in
ethylene, and contributes $2(E_0-A)$ to the energy if $E_0$ is now the
energy to put an electron on a site in benzene and $A$ is the
amplitude to flip to the next site. So the energy should be
roughly $6(E_0-A)$. But when we studied benzene before, we got that the energy
was lower than the energy of the structure with three extra
bonds. Let’s see if the energy for benzene comes out lower than three
bonds from our new point of view.</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch15-S4-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">We start with the six-times ionized benzene ring and add one
electron. Now we have a six-state system. We haven’t solved such a
system yet, but we know what to do. We can write six equations in the
six amplitudes, and so on. But let’s save some work—by noticing that
we’ve already solved the problem, when we worked out the problem of an
electron on an infinite line of atoms. Of course, the benzene is not
an infinite line, it has $6$ atomic sites in a circle. But imagine
that we open out the circle to a line, and number the atoms along the
line from $1$ to $6$. In an infinite line the next location would
be $7$, but if we insist that this location be identical with number $1$
and so on, the situation will be just like the benzene ring. In other
words we can take the solution for an infinite line <em class="emph">with an
added requirement</em> that the solution must be periodic with a cycle six
atoms long. From Chapter <a href="III_13.html">13</a> the electron on a line has
states of definite energy when the amplitude at each site
is $e^{ikx_n}=e^{ikbn}$. For each $k$ the energy is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:15:25}
E=E_0-2A\cos kb.
\end{equation}

We want to use now only those solutions which repeat every
$6$ atoms. Let’s do first the general case for a ring of $N$ atoms. If the
solution is to have a period of $N$ atomic spacing, $e^{ikbN}$ must be
unity; or $kbN$ must be a multiple of $2\pi$. Taking $s$ to represent
any integer, our condition is that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:15:26}
kbN=2\pi s.
\end{equation}

We have seen before that there is no meaning to taking $k$’s outside
the range $\pm\pi/b$. This means that we get all possible states by
taking values of $s$ in the range $\pm N/2$.</p>

s/N$, or $2\pi s/6$ for benzene), then the vertical heights of the
points on the circle are the solutions of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1525">15.25</a>). The
six points represent the six possible states. The lowest energy level is
at $(E_0-2A)$; there are two states with the same energy $(E_0-A)$, and

<p class="p">We can use this description to calculate or understand other
properties of benzene. For example, using Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F8">15–8</a> we can discuss
the excitation of benzene by light. What would happen if we tried to
excite one of the electrons? It could move up to one of the empty
higher states. The lowest energy of excitation would be a transition
from the highest filled level to the lowest empty level. That takes
the energy $2A$. Benzene will absorb light of frequency $\nu$
when $h\nu=2A$. There will also be absorption of photons with the energies
$3A$ and $4A$. Needless to say, the absorption spectrum of benzene has
been measured and the pattern of spectral lines is more or less
correct except that the lowest transition occurs in the ultraviolet;
and to fit the data one would have to choose a value of $A$ between
$1.4$ and $2.4$ electron volts. That is, the numerical value of $A$ is
two or three times larger than is predicted from the chemical binding
energy.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S4-p16" class="para">
<p class="p">What the chemist does in situations like this is to analyze many
molecules of a similar kind and get some empirical rules. He learns,
for example: For calculating binding energy use such and such a value
of $A$, but for getting the absorption spectrum approximately right
use another value of $A$. You may feel that this sounds a little
absurd. It is not very satisfactory from the point of view of a
physicist who is trying to understand nature from first
principles. But the problem of the chemist is different. He must try
to guess ahead of time what is going to happen with molecules that
haven’t been made yet, or which aren’t understood completely. What he
needs is a series of empirical rules; it doesn’t make much difference
where they come from. So he uses the theory in quite a different way
than the physicist. He takes equations that have some shadow of the
truth in them, but then he must alter the constants in them—making
empirical corrections.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S4-p17" class="para">
<p class="p">In the case of benzene, the principal reason for the inconsistency is
our assumption that the electrons are independent—the theory we
started with is really not legitimate. Nevertheless, it has some
shadow of the truth because its results seem to be going in the right
direction. With such equations plus some empirical rules—including
various exceptions—the organic chemist makes his way through the
morass of complicated things he chooses to study. (Don’t forget that
the reason a physicist can really calculate from first principles is
that he chooses only simple problems. He never solves a problem with
$42$ or even $6$ electrons in it. So far, he has been able to
calculate reasonably accurately only the hydrogen atom and the helium
atom.)</p>

carbon atoms in a line. You already know how to solve a line. You
say, “Oh no, I only know how to solve an <em class="emph">infinite</em> line.” But
the solutions for the infinite line also include the ones for a finite
line. Watch. Let $N$ be the number of atoms on the line and number
them from $1$ to $N$ as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F10">15–10</a>. In writing the
equations for the amplitude at position $1$ you would not have a term
feeding from position $0$. Similarly, the equation for position $N$
would differ from the one that we used for an infinite line because
there would be nothing feeding from position $N+1$. But suppose that
we can obtain a solution for the infinite line which has the following
property: the amplitude to be at atom $0$ is zero and the amplitude to
be at atom $(N+1)$ is also zero. Then the set of equations for all the
locations from $1$ to $N$ on the finite line are also satisfied. You
might think no such solution exists for the infinite line because our
solutions all looked like $e^{ikx_n}$ which has the same absolute
value of the amplitude everywhere. But you will remember that the
energy depends only on the absolute value of $k$, so that another
solution, which is equally legitimate for the same energy, would
be $e^{-ikx_n}$. And the same is true of any superposition of these two
solutions. By subtracting them we can get the solution $\sin kx_n$,
which satisfies the requirement that the amplitude be zero
at $x=0$. It still corresponds to the energy $(E_0-2A\cos kb)$. Now by a
suitable choice for the value of $k$ we can also make the amplitude
zero at $x_{N+1}$. This requires that $(N+1)kb$ be a multiple
of $\pi$, or that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:15:29}
kb=\frac{\pi}{(N+1)}\,s,

$N=4$, so there are four states with

can get a whole set of energy levels. There are strong absorption lines
from transitions between these levels which lie in the visible part of
the spectrum, and give this molecule its strong color. Similar
complicated molecules such as the xanthophylls, which make leaves turn
red, can be studied in the same way.</p>

<p class="p">There is one more idea which emerges from the application of this kind
of theory in organic chemistry. It is probably the most successful or,
at least in a certain sense, the most accurate. This idea has to do
with the question: In what situations does one get a particularly
strong chemical binding? The answer is very interesting. Take the
example, first, of benzene, and imagine the sequence of events that
occurs as we start with the six-times ionized molecule and add more
and more electrons. We would then be thinking of various benzene
ions—negative or positive. Suppose we plot the energy of the ion (or
neutral molecule) as a function of the number of electrons. If we
take $E_0=0$ (since we don’t know what it is), we get the curve shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F13">15–13</a>. For the first two electrons the slope of the function
is
a straight line. For each successive group the slope increases, and
there is a discontinuity in slope between the groups of electrons. The
slope changes when one has just finished filling a set of levels which
all have the same energy and must move up to the next higher set of
levels for the next electron.</p>

<p class="p">The actual energy of the benzene ion is really quite different from
the curve of Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F13">15–13</a> because of the interactions of the
electrons
and because of electrostatic energies we have been neglecting. These
corrections will, however, vary with $n$ in a rather smooth way. Even
if we were to make all these corrections, the resulting energy curve
would still have kinks at those values of $n$ which just fill up a
particular energy level.

stability—chemically speaking. Notice that the configurations
farther below the curve always occur at the end of one of the straight
line segments—namely when there are enough electrons to fill up an
“energy shell,” as it is called. This is the very accurate
prediction of the theory. Molecules—or ions—are particularly
stable (in comparison with other similar configurations) when the
available electrons just fill up an energy shell.</p>

<div id="Ch15-S5-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">This theory has explained and predicted some very peculiar chemical
facts. To take a very simple example, consider a ring of three. It’s
almost unbelievable that the chemist can make a ring of three and have
it stable, but it has been done. The energy circle for three electrons
is shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F15">15–15</a>. Now if you put two electrons in the lower
state, you have only two of the three electrons that you require. The
third electron must be put in at a much higher level. By our argument
this molecule should not be particularly stable, whereas the
two-electron structure should be stable. It does turn out, in fact,
that the neutral molecule of triphenyl cyclopropenyl is very hard to make, but that the positive ion
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch15-F16">15–16</a> is relatively easy to make. The ring
of three is never really easy because there is always a large stress
when the bonds in an organic molecule make an equilateral triangle. To
make a stable compound at all, the structure must be stabilized in some
way. Anyway if you add three benzene rings on the corners, the positive
ion can be made. (The reason for this requirement of added benzene rings
is not really understood.)

<p class="p">In a similar way the five-sided ring can also be analyzed. If you draw
the energy diagram, you can see in a qualitative way that the
six-electron structure should be an especially stable structure, so
that such a molecule should be most stable as a negative ion. Now the
five-ring is well known and easy to make and always acts as a negative
ion. Similarly, you can easily verify that a ring of $4$ or $8$ is not
very interesting, but that a ring of $14$ or $10$—like a ring
of $6$—should be especially stable as a neutral object.</p>

<span class="tag">15–6</span>Other uses of the approximation</h3>
<div id="Ch15-S6-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">There are two other similar situations which we will describe only
briefly. In considering the structure of an atom, we can consider that
the electrons fill successive shells. The Schrödinger theory of
electron motion can be worked out easily only for a <em class="emph">single</em>
electron moving in a “central” field—one which varies only with
the distance from a point. How can we then understand what goes on in
an atom which has $22$ electrons?! One way is to use a kind of
independent particle approximation. First you calculate what happens
with one electron. You get a number of energy levels. You put an
electron into the lowest energy state. You can, for a rough model,
continue to ignore the electron interactions and go on filling
successive shells, but there is a way to get better answers by taking
into account—in an approximate way at least—the effect of the
electric charge carried by the electron. Each time you add an electron
you compute its amplitude to be at various places, and then use this
amplitude to estimate a kind of spherically symmetric charge
distribution. You use the field of this distribution—together with
the field of the positive nucleus and all the previous electrons—to
calculate the states available for the next electron. In this way you
can get reasonably correct estimates for the energies for the neutral
atom and for various ionized states. You find that there are energy
shells, just as we saw for the electrons in a ring molecule. With a
partially filled shell, the atom will show a preference for taking on
one or more extra electrons, or for losing some electrons so as to get
into the most stable state of a filled shell.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">This theory explains the machinery behind the fundamental chemical
properties which show up in the periodic table of the elements. The
inert gases are those elements in which a shell has just been
completed, and it is especially difficult to make them react. (Some of
them do react of course—with fluorine and oxygen, for example; but
such compounds are very weakly bound; the so-called inert gases are
nearly inert.) An atom which has one electron more or one electron
less than an inert gas will easily lose or gain an electron to get
into the especially stable (low-energy) condition which comes from
having a completely filled shell—they are the very active chemical
elements of valence $+1$ or $-1$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch15-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The other situation is found in nuclear physics. In atomic nuclei the
protons and neutrons interact with each other quite strongly. Even so,
the independent particle model can again be used to analyze nuclear
structure. It was first discovered experimentally that nuclei were
especially stable if they contained certain particular numbers of
neutrons—namely $2$, $8$, $20$, $28$, $50$, $82$. Nuclei containing
protons in these numbers are also especially stable. Since there was
initially no explanation for these numbers they were called the
“magic numbers” of nuclear physics. It is well known that neutrons
and protons interact strongly with each other; people were, therefore,
quite surprised when it was discovered that an independent particle
model predicted a shell structure which came out with the first few
magic numbers. The model assumed that each nucleon (proton or neutron)
moved in a central potential which was created by the average effects
of all the other nucleons. This model failed, however, to give the
correct values for the higher magic numbers. Then it was discovered by
Maria Mayer,
and independently by Jensen
and his collaborators, that by taking the independent particle model and
adding only a correction for what is called the “spin-orbit
interaction,” one could make an improved
model which gave all of the magic numbers. (The spin-orbit interaction
causes the energy of a nucleon to be lower if its spin has the same
direction as its orbital angular momentum from motion in the nucleus.)
The theory gives even more—its picture of the so—called “shell
structure” of the nuclei enables us to predict certain characteristics
of nuclei and of nuclear reactions.

<p class="p">The independent particle approximation has been found useful in a wide
range of subjects—from solid-state physics, to chemistry, to
biology, to nuclear physics. It is often only a crude approximation,
but is able to give an understanding of why there are especially
stable conditions—in shells. Since it omits all of the complexity of
the interactions between the individual particles, we should not be
surprised that it often fails completely to give correctly many
important details.</p>

  The ground state here is really “degenerate”; there are
other states with the same energy—for example, all spins down, or
all in any other direction. The slightest external field in the
$z$-direction will give a different energy to all these states, and
the one we have chosen will be the true ground state.
