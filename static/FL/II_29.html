<span class="tag">29–1</span>Motion in a uniform electric or magnetic field</h3>
<div id="Ch29-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We want now to describe—mainly in a qualitative way—the motions of
charges in various circumstances. Most of the interesting phenomena in
which charges are moving in fields occur in very complicated
situations, with many, many charges all interacting with each
other. For instance, when an electromagnetic wave goes through a block
of material or a plasma, billions and billions of charges are
interacting with the wave and with each other. We will come to such
problems later, but now we just want to discuss the much simpler
problem of the motions of a single charge in a <em class="emph">given</em> field. We
can then disregard all other charges—except, of course, those
charges and currents which exist somewhere to produce the fields we
will assume.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch29-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We should probably ask first about the motion of a particle in a
uniform electric field. At low velocities, the motion is not
particularly interesting—it is just a uniform acceleration in the
direction of the field. However, if the particle picks up enough
energy to become relativistic, then the motion gets more
complicated. But we will leave the solution for that case for you to
play with.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch29-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Next, we consider the motion in a uniform magnetic field with zero
electric field. We have already solved this problem—one solution is
that the particle goes in a circle. The magnetic
force $q\FLPv\times\FLPB$ is always at right angles to the motion,
so $d\FLPp/dt$ is perpendicular to $\FLPp$ and has the magnitude $vp/R$,
where $R$ is the radius of the circle:
\begin{equation*}
F=qvB=\frac{vp}{R}.

can be no component of the magnetic force in the direction of the field.
The general motion of a particle in a uniform magnetic field is a
constant velocity parallel to $\FLPB$ and a circular motion at right
angles to $\FLPB$—the trajectory is a cylindrical helix

shot into a uniform magnetic field at the point $A$ in

circle whose radius is proportional to its momentum. If all the
particles enter perpendicular to the edge of the field, they will leave
the field at a distance $x$ (from $A$) which is proportional to their
momentum $p$. A counter placed at some point such as $C$ will detect

<p class="p">It is, of course, not necessary that the particles go through
$180^\circ$ before they are counted, but the so-called
“$180^\circ$ spectrometer” has a special property. It is not necessary
that all the particles enter at right angles to the field edge.
Figure <a href="#Ch29-F2">29–2</a>(b) shows the trajectories of three particles,
all with the <em class="emph">same</em> momentum but entering the field at different
angles. You see that they take different trajectories, but all leave the
field very close to the point $C$. We say that there is a “focus.”
Such a focusing property has the advantage that larger angles can be
accepted at $A$—although some limit is usually imposed, as shown in
the figure. A larger angular acceptance usually means that more
particles are counted in a given time, decreasing the time required for
a given measurement.</p>

<p class="p">By varying the magnetic field, or moving the counter along in $x$, or by
using many counters to cover a range of $x$, the “spectrum” of
momenta in the incoming beam can be measured.
[By the “momentum spectrum” $f(p)$, we mean that the number of
particles with momenta between $p$ and $(p+dp)$ is $f(p)\,dp$.] Such
measurements have been made, for example, to determine the distribution
of energies in the $\beta$-decay of various nuclei.

<p class="p">There are many other forms of momentum spectrometers, but we will
describe just one more, which has an especially large <em class="emph">solid</em>
angle of acceptance. It is based on the helical orbits in a uniform
field, like the one shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch29-F1">29–1</a>. Let’s think of a cylindrical
coordinate system—$\rho,\theta,z$—set up with the $z$-axis along
the direction of the field. If a particle is emitted from the origin
at some angle $\alpha$ with respect to the $z$-axis, it will move
along a spiral whose equation is
\begin{equation*}
\rho=a\sin kz,\quad\theta=bz,
\end{equation*}

where $a$, $b$, and $k$ are parameters you can easily work out in
terms of $p$, $\alpha$, and the magnetic field $B$. If we plot the
distance $\rho$ from the axis as a function of $z$ for a given
momentum, but for several starting angles, we will get curves like the
solid ones drawn in Fig. <a href="#Ch29-F3">29–3</a>. (Remember that this is just a kind of
projection of a helical trajectory.) When the angle between the axis
and the starting direction is larger, the peak value of $\rho$ is
large but the longitudinal velocity is less, so the trajectories for
different angles tend to come to a kind of “focus” near the
point $A$ in the figure. If we put a narrow aperture of $A$, particles with
a range of initial angles can still get through and pass on to the
axis, where they can be counted by the long detector $D$.</p>

small interval of momenta. The advantage over the first spectrometer
described is that the aperture $A$—and the aperture $A'$—can be an
annulus, so that particles which leave the source in a rather large
solid angle are accepted. A large fraction of the particles from the
source are used—an important advantage for weak sources or for very
precise measurements.</p>

<p class="p">One pays a price for this advantage, however, because a large volume
of uniform magnetic field is required, and this is usually only
practical for low-energy particles. One way of making a uniform field,
you remember, is to wind a coil on a sphere, with a surface current
density proportional to the sine of the angle. You can also show that
the same thing is true for an ellipsoid of rotation. So such
spectrometers are often made by winding an elliptical coil on a wooden

<p class="p">One example of an electron lens is sketched in Fig. <a href="#Ch29-F5">29–5</a>. It is an
“electrostatic” lens whose operation depends on the electric field
between two adjacent electrodes. Its operation can be understood by
considering what happens to a parallel beam that enters from the
left. When the electrons arrive at the region $a$, they feel a force
with a sidewise component and get a certain impulse that bends them
toward the axis. You might think that they would get an equal and
opposite impulse in the region $b$, but that is not so. By the time
the electrons reach $b$ they have gained energy and so <em class="emph">spend
less time</em> in the region $b$. The forces are the same, but the time is
shorter, so the impulse is less. In going through the regions $a$
and $b$, there is a net axial impulse, and the electrons are bent toward a
common point. In leaving the high-voltage region, the particles get
another kick toward the axis. The force is outward in region $c$ and
inward in region $d$, but the particles stay longer in the latter
region, so there is again a net impulse. For distances not too far
from the axis, the total impulse through the lens is proportional to
the distance from the axis (Can you see why?), and this is just the
condition necessary for lens-type focusing.</p>

<div id="Ch29-S3-p3" class="para">

<p class="p">Another kind of lens—often found in electron microscopes—is the
magnetic lens sketched schematically in Fig. <a href="#Ch29-F6">29–6</a>. A cylindrically
symmetric electromagnet has very sharp circular pole tips which
produce a strong, nonuniform field in a small region. Electrons which
travel vertically through this region are focused. You can understand
the mechanism by looking at the magnified view of the pole-tip region
drawn in Fig. <a href="#Ch29-F7">29–7</a>. Consider two electrons $a$ and $b$ that leave
the source $S$ at some angle with respect to the axis. As electron $a$
reaches the beginning of the field, it is deflected <em class="emph">away from
you</em> by the horizontal component of the field. But then it will have a
lateral velocity, so that when it passes through the strong vertical
field, it will get an impulse toward the axis. Its lateral motion is
taken out by the magnetic force as it leaves the field, so the net
effect is an impulse toward the axis, plus a “rotation” about the
axis. All the forces on particle $b$ are opposite, so it also is
deflected toward the axis. In the figure, the divergent electrons are
brought into parallel paths. The action is like a lens with an object
at the focal point. Another similar lens upstream can be used to focus
the electrons back to a single point, making an image of the source $S$.</p>

of Vol. I the basic limitations of any optical system due to
diffraction of the lens opening. If a lens opening subtends the
angle $2\theta$ from a source (see Fig. <a href="#Ch29-F8">29–8</a>), two neighboring spots at
the source cannot be seen as separate if they are closer than about
\begin{equation*}
\delta\approx\frac{\lambda}{\sin\theta},

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light. With the best optical
microscope, $\theta$ approaches the theoretical limit of $90^\circ$,
so $\delta$ is about equal to $\lambda$, or approximately
$5000$ angstroms.</p>

<div id="Ch29-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">The same limitation would also apply to an electron microscope, but
there the wavelength is—for $50$-kilovolt electrons—about
$0.05$ angstrom. If one could use a lens opening of near $30^\circ$, it would
be possible to see objects only $\tfrac{1}{5}$ of an angstrom
apart. Since the atoms in molecules are typically $1$ or $2$ angstroms
apart, we could get photographs of molecules. Biology would be easy;
we would have a photograph of the DNA structure. What a tremendous

<p class="p">Unfortunately, the best resolving power that has been achieved in an
electron microscope is more like $20$ angstroms. The reason is that no
one has yet designed a lens with a large opening. All lenses have
“spherical aberration,”
which means that rays at large angles from the axis have a different
point of focus than the rays nearer the axis, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch29-F9">29–9</a>. By special techniques, optical microscope lenses
can be made with a negligible spherical aberration, but no one has yet
been able to make an electron lens which avoids spherical aberration.

central orbit. From our arguments there will be vertical focusing,
provided that the <em class="emph">vertical</em> field decreases with increasing
radius; but if the field gradient is positive, there will be
“vertical defocusing.” So for vertical focusing, the field index $n$

displacement, feels a stronger force, and so is bent toward the axis.
Again the net effect is focusing. Thus a pair of quadrupole
lenses acts
independently for horizontal and vertical motion—very much like an
optical lens. Quadrupole lenses are used to form and control beams
of particles in much the same way that optical lenses are used for light
beams.

<p class="p">We should point out that an alternating-gradient system does not
<em class="emph">always</em> produce focusing. If the gradients are too large (in
relation to the particle momentum or to the spacing between the
lenses), the net effect can be a defocusing one. You can see how that
could happen if you imagine that the spacing between the two lenses of
Fig. <a href="#Ch29-F17">29–17</a> were increased, say, by a factor of three or four.</p>

<p class="p">Let’s return now to the synchrotron guide
magnet. We can consider that it consists of an alternating sequence of
“positive” and “negative” lenses with a superimposed uniform
field. The uniform field serves to bend the particles, on the average,
in a horizontal circle (with no effect on the vertical motion), and
the alternating lenses act on any particles that might tend to go
astray—pushing them always toward the central orbit (on the
average).

<div id="Ch29-S7-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">There is a nice mechanical analog which demonstrates that a force which
alternates between a “focusing” force and a “defocusing” force can
have a net “focusing” effect. Imagine a mechanical “pendulum” which
consists of a <em class="emph">solid</em> rod with a weight on the end, suspended from
a pivot which is arranged to be moved rapidly up and down by a motor
driven crank. Such a pendulum has <em class="emph">two</em> equilibrium positions.
Besides the normal, downward-hanging position, the pendulum is also in
equilibrium “hanging upward”—with its “bob” <em class="emph">above</em> the
pivot! Such a pendulum is drawn in Fig. <a href="#Ch29-F18">29–18</a>.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch29-S7-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">By the following argument you can see that the vertical pivot motion
is equivalent to an alternating focusing force. When the pivot is
accelerated downward, the “bob” tends to move inward, as indicated
in Fig. <a href="#Ch29-F19">29–19</a>. When the pivot is accelerated upward, the effect is
reversed. The force restoring the “bob” toward the axis alternates,
but the average effect is a force toward the axis. So the pendulum
will swing back and forth about a neutral position which is just
opposite the normal one.</p>

<div id="Ch29-S7-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">There is, of course, a much easier way of keeping a pendulum upside
down, and that is by <em class="emph">balancing</em> it on your finger! But try to
balance <em class="emph">two independent</em> sticks on the <em class="emph">same finger</em>! Or
one stick with your eyes closed! Balancing involves making a
correction for what is going wrong. And this is not possible, in
general, if there are several things going wrong at once. In a
synchrotron there are billions of particles going
around together, each one of which may start out with a different
“error.” The kind of focusing we have been describing works on them
all.

<span class="tag">29–8</span>Motion in crossed electric and magnetic fields</h3>
<div id="Ch29-S8-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">So far we have talked about particles in electric fields only or in
magnetic fields only. There are some interesting effects when there
are both kinds of fields at the same time. Suppose we have a uniform
magnetic field $\FLPB$ and an electric field $\FLPE$ at right
angles. Particles that start out perpendicular to $\FLPB$ will move in
a curve like the one in Fig. <a href="#Ch29-F20">29–20</a>. (The figure is a <em class="emph">plane</em>
curve, <em class="emph">not</em> a helix!) We can understand this motion
qualitatively. When the particle (assumed positive) moves in the
direction of $\FLPE$, it picks up speed, and so it is bent less by the
magnetic field. When it is going against the $\FLPE$-field, it loses
speed and is continually bent more by the magnetic field. The net
effect is that it has an average “drift” in the direction
of $\FLPE\times\FLPB$.</p>

<div id="Ch29-S8-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We can, in fact, show that the motion is a uniform circular motion
superimposed on a uniform sidewise motion at the speed $v_d=E/B$—the
trajectory in Fig. <a href="#Ch29-F20">29–20</a> is a cycloid. Imagine an observer
who is moving to the right at a constant speed. In his frame our
magnetic field gets transformed to a new magnetic field <em class="emph">plus</em> an
electric field in the <em class="emph">downward</em> direction. If he has just the
right speed, his total electric field will be zero, and he will see the
electron going in a circle. So the motion <em class="emph">we</em> see is a circular
motion, plus a translation at the drift speed $v_d=E/B$. The motion of
electrons in crossed electric and magnetic fields is the basis of the
<em class="emph">magnetron</em> tubes, i.e., oscillators used for generating microwave
energy.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch29-S8-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">There are many other interesting examples of particle motions in
electric and magnetic fields—such as the orbits of the electrons and
protons trapped in the Van Allen belts—but we do not, unfortunately,
have the time to deal with them here.</p>
