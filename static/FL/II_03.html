<p class="p">We found in Chapter <a href="II_02.html">2</a> that there were various ways of
taking derivatives of fields. Some gave vector fields; some gave
scalar fields. Although we developed many different formulas,
everything in Chapter <a href="II_02.html">2</a> could be summarized in one rule:
the operators $\ddpl{}{x}$, $\ddpl{}{y}$, and $\ddpl{}{z}$ are the
three components of a vector operator $\FLPnabla$. We would now like
to get some understanding of the significance of the derivatives of
fields. We will then have a better feeling for what a vector field
equation means.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch3-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We have already discussed the meaning of the gradient
operation
($\FLPnabla$ on a scalar). Now we turn to the meanings of the
divergence
and curl operations.
The interpretation of these quantities is best done in terms of certain
vector integrals and equations relating such integrals. These equations
cannot, unfortunately, be obtained from vector
algebra by
some easy substitution, so you will just have to learn them as something
new. Of these integral formulas, one is practically trivial, but the
other two are not. We will derive them and explain their implications.
The equations we shall study are really mathematical theorems. They will
be useful not only for interpreting the meaning and the content of the
divergence and the curl, but also in working out general physical
theories. These mathematical theorems are, for the theory of fields,
what the theorem of the conservation of energy is to the mechanics of
particles. General theorems like these are important for a deeper
understanding of physics. You will find, though, that they are not very
useful for solving problems—except in the simplest cases. It is
delightful, however, that in the beginning of our subject there will be
many simple problems which can be solved with the three integral
formulas we are going to treat. We will see, however, as the problems

<p class="p">The integral in our theorem, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII31">3.1</a>), means the same

another scalar—the component of $\FLPgrad{\psi}$ in the direction
of $\Delta\FLPs$. If we write $(\FLPgrad{\psi})_t$ for this tangential
component, it is clear that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:3:2}
(\FLPgrad{\psi})_t\,\Delta s=(\FLPgrad{\psi})\cdot\Delta\FLPs.

along a small displacement $\Delta\FLPR$ was the rate
of change of $\psi$ in the direction of $\Delta\FLPR$. Consider the line
segment $\Delta\FLPs$ from $(1)$ to point $a$ in Fig. <a href="#Ch3-F2">3–2</a>.
According to our definition,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:3:3}
\Delta\psi_1=\psi(a)-\psi(1)=(\FLPgrad{\psi})_1\cdot\Delta\FLPs_1.
\end{equation}

Also, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:3:4}
\psi(b)-\psi(a)=(\FLPgrad{\psi})_2\cdot\Delta\FLPs_2,
\end{equation}

where, of course, $(\FLPgrad{\psi})_1$ means the gradient evaluated at the segment $\Delta\FLPs_1$, and $(\FLPgrad{\psi})_2$, the gradient evaluated at $\Delta\FLPs_2$. If we add Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII33">3.3</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII34">3.4</a>), we get
\begin{equation}

\psi(b)-\psi(1)=(\FLPgrad{\psi})_1\cdot\Delta\FLPs_1+

You can see that if we keep adding such terms, we get the result
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:3:6}
\psi(2)-\psi(1)=\sum\nolimits_i(\FLPgrad{\psi})_i\cdot\Delta\FLPs_i.

The left-hand side doesn’t depend on how we choose our intervals—if
$(1)$ and $(2)$ are kept always the same—so we can take the limit of
the right-hand side. We have therefore proved Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII31">3.1</a>).</p>

an easily understood physical significance in the case of heat
flow. We have defined the vector $\FLPh$, which represents the heat
that flows through a unit area in a unit time. Suppose that inside a

volume $V$ (Fig. <a href="#Ch3-F3">3–3</a>). We would like to find out how

we want is
\begin{equation}

The heat flow out through $da$ is then

<p class="p">Returning to the special case of heat flow, let us take a situation in
which <em class="emph">heat is conserved</em>. For example, imagine some material in

the heat content of the volume inside must decrease. So, in
circumstances in which heat would be conserved, we say that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:3:13}
\int_S\FLPh\cdot\FLPn\,da=-\ddt{Q}{t},
\end{equation}

where $Q$ is the heat inside the surface. The heat flux out of $S$ is
equal to minus the rate of change with respect to time of the total
heat $Q$ inside of $S$. This interpretation is possible because we are
speaking of heat flow and also because we supposed that the heat was
conserved. We could not, of course, speak of the total heat inside the
volume if heat were being generated there.</p>

<p class="p">Now we shall point out an interesting fact about the flux of any
vector. You may think of the heat flow vector if you wish, but what we

closed surface $S$ that encloses the volume $V$. We now separate the
volume into two parts by some kind of a “cut,” as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch3-F4">3–4</a>. Now we have two closed surfaces and volumes. The
volume $V_1$ is enclosed in the surface $S_1$, which is made up of part
of the original surface $S_a$ and of the surface of the cut, $S_{ab}$.
The volume $V_2$ is enclosed by $S_2$, which is made up of the rest of
the original surface $S_b$ and closed off by the cut $S_{ab}$. Now
consider the following question: Suppose we calculate the flux out

the sum equal the flux through the whole surface that we started with?
The answer is yes. The flux through the part of the surfaces $S_{ab}$
common to both $S_1$ and $S_2$ just exactly cancels out. For the flux of
the vector $\FLPC$ out of $V_1$ we can write

Note that in the second integral we have written $\FLPn_1$ for the
outward normal for $S_{ab}$ when it belongs to $S_1$, and $\FLPn_2$
when it belongs to $S_2$, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch3-F4">3–4</a>. Clearly,
$\FLPn_1=-\FLPn_2$, so that

\int_{S_{ab}}\FLPC\cdot\FLPn_1\,da=-\int_{S_{ab}}\FLPC\cdot\FLPn_2\,da.

If we now add Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII314">3.14</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII315">3.15</a>), we see that the sum of the fluxes through $S_1$ and $S_2$ is just the sum of two integrals which, taken together, give the flux through the original surface $S=S_a+S_b$.</p>

<div id="Ch3-S2-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">We see that the flux through the complete outer surface $S$ can be

for <em class="emph">any</em> way of dividing the original volume, it must be generally

<p class="p">We now take the special case of a small cube<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a>
and find an interesting formula for the flux out of it. Consider a
cube whose edges are lined up with the axes as in Fig. <a href="#Ch3-F5">3–5</a>.
Let us suppose that the coordinates of the corner nearest the origin are
$x$, $y$, $z$. Let $\Delta x$ be the length of the cube in the $x$-direction,
$\Delta y$ be the length in the $y$-direction, and $\Delta z$ be the
length in the $z$-direction. We wish to find the flux of a vector
field $\FLPC$ through the surface of the cube. We shall do this by
making a sum of the fluxes through each of the six faces. First,
consider the face marked $1$ in the figure. The flux <em class="emph">outward</em> on
this face is the negative of the $x$-component of $\FLPC$, integrated
over the area of the face. This flux is
\begin{equation*}
-\int C_x\,dy\,dz.
\end{equation*}

Since we are considering a <em class="emph">small</em> cube, we can approximate this
integral by the value of $C_x$ at the center of the face—which we
call the point $(1)$—multiplied by the area of the face, $\Delta
y\,\Delta z$:
\begin{equation*}
\text{Flux out of $1$}=-C_x(1)\,\Delta y\,\Delta z.
\end{equation*}

Similarly, for the flux out of face $2$, we write
\begin{equation*}
\text{Flux out of $2$}=C_x(2)\,\Delta y\,\Delta z.
\end{equation*}

Now $C_x(1)$ and $C_x(2)$ are, in general, slightly different.
If $\Delta x$ is small enough, we can write
\begin{equation*}
C_x(2)=C_x(1)+\ddp{C_x}{x}\,\Delta x.
\end{equation*}

There are, of course, more terms, but they will involve $(\Delta x)^2$
and higher powers, and so will be negligible if we consider only the
limit of small $\Delta x$. So the flux through face $2$ is
\begin{equation*}
\text{Flux out of $2$}=\biggl[C_x(1)+\ddp{C_x}{x}\,\Delta
x\biggr]\,\Delta y\,\Delta z.
\end{equation*}

Summing the fluxes for faces $1$ and $2$, we get
\begin{equation*}
\text{Flux out of $1$ and $2$}=\ddp{C_x}{x}\,\Delta x\,\Delta
y\,\Delta z.
\end{equation*}

The derivative should really be evaluated at the center of face $1$;
that is, at $[x,y+(\Delta y/2),z+(\Delta z/2)]$. But in the limit of
an infinitesimal cube, we make a negligible error if we evaluate it at
the corner $(x,y,z)$.</p>

<div id="Ch3-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Applying the same reasoning to each of the other pairs of faces, we

and
\begin{equation*}
\text{Flux out of $5$ and $6$}=\ddp{C_z}{z}\,\Delta x\,\Delta y\,\Delta z.

<div id="Ch3-S3-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The total flux through all the faces is the sum of these terms. We

y\,\Delta z,
\end{equation*}

and the sum of the derivatives is just $\FLPdiv{\FLPC}$. Also, $\Delta
x\,\Delta y\,\Delta z=\Delta V$, the volume of the cube. So we can say
that <em class="emph">for an infinitesimal cube</em>
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:3:17}
\underset{\text{surface}}{\int}\FLPC\cdot\FLPn\,da=

We have shown that the outward flux from the surface of an
infinitesimal cube is equal to the divergence of the vector multiplied
by the volume of the cube. We now see the “meaning” of the
divergence of a vector. The divergence of a vector at the point $P$ is
the flux—the outgoing “flow” of $\FLPC$—<em class="emph">per unit volume</em>,

over the entire volume. This gives us the theorem that the integral of

sources of heat, so that heat is conserved. Then how much heat is
there inside some chosen volume at any time? It must be

when integrated over any surface, always gives $W$. We can, however,
find the field rather easily by taking a somewhat special surface. We
take a sphere of radius $R$, centered at the source, and assume that
the heat flow is radial (Fig. <a href="#Ch3-F6">3–6</a>). Our intuition tells
us that $\FLPh$ should be radial if the block of material is large and
we don’t get too close to the edges, and it should also have the same

little square. It will be easy to do the line integral if we make the
square small enough that the vector $\FLPC$ doesn’t change much along
any one side of the square. (The assumption is better the smaller the
square, so we are really talking about infinitesimal squares.)
Starting at the point $(x,y)$—the lower left corner of the

the first side—marked $(1)$—the tangential component is $C_x(1)$
and the distance is $\Delta x$. The first part of the integral

You might think that to our approximation the difference is zero. That
is true to the first approximation. We can be more accurate, however,

write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:3:33}
C_x(3)=C_x(1)+\ddp{C_x}{y}\,\Delta y.

in $(\Delta y)^2$, but since we will ultimately think of the limit as
$\Delta y\to0$, such terms can be neglected. Putting (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII333">3.33</a>)

The circulation around our square is then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:3:36}
\biggl(\ddp{C_y}{x}-\ddp{C_x}{y}\biggr)\Delta x\,\Delta y,

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:3:39}
\underset{\substack{\text{any closed}\\\text{surface}}}{\int}
(\FLPcurl{\FLPC})_n\,da=0.
\end{equation}

<div id="Ch3-S7-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now this is interesting, because we already have a theorem about the
surface integral of a vector field. Such a surface integral is equal
to the volume integral of the divergence of the vector, according to
Gauss’ theorem (Eq. <a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII318">3.18</a>). Gauss’ theorem, applied
to $\FLPcurl{\FLPC}$, says
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:3:40}
\underset{\substack{\text{closed}\\\text{surface}}}{\int}
(\FLPcurl{\FLPC})_n\,da=
\underset{\substack{\text{volume}\\\text{inside}}}{\int}
\FLPdiv{(\FLPcurl{\FLPC})}\,dV.
\end{equation}

So we conclude that the second integral must also be zero:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:3:41}
\underset{\substack{\text{any}\\\text{volume}}}{\int}
\FLPdiv{(\FLPcurl{\FLPC})}\,dV=0,
\end{equation}

and this is true for any vector field $\FLPC$ whatever. Since
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII341">3.41</a>) is true for <em class="emph">any volume</em>, it must be true
that at <em class="emph">every point</em> in space the integrand is zero. We have
\begin{equation*}
\FLPdiv{(\FLPcurl{\FLPC})}=0,\quad\text{always}.
\end{equation*}

But this is the same result we got from vector
algebra in
Section <a href="II_02.html#Ch2-S7">2–7</a>. Now we begin to see how everything fits
together.
