<p class="p">In this chapter we shall discuss certain aspects of oscillating
systems that are found somewhat more generally than just in the
particular systems we have been discussing. For our particular system,
the differential equation that we have been solving is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:25:1}
m\,\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\gamma m\,\ddt{x}{t}+m\omega_0^2x=F(t).
\end{equation}
Now this particular combination of “operations” on the variable $x$
has the interesting property that if we substitute $(x + y)$ for $x$,
then we get the sum of the same operations on $x$ and $y$; or, if we
multiply $x$ by $a$, then we get just $a$ times the same
combination. This is easy to prove. Just as a “shorthand” notation,
because we get tired of writing down all those letters
in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI251">25.1</a>), we shall use the symbol $\uL(x)$ instead. When we
see this, it means the left-hand side of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI251">25.1</a>), with $x$
substituted in. With this system of writing, $\uL(x + y)$ would mean the
following:
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:25:2}
\uL(x+y)=m\,\frac{d^2(x+y)}{dt^2}+\gamma m\,\ddt{(x+y)}{t}

equations (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI253">25.3</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI254">25.4</a>) are maintained or not.
If they are, we call such a problem a <em class="emph">linear</em> problem. In this
chapter we shall discuss some of the properties that exist because the
system is linear, to appreciate the generality of some of the results
that we have obtained in our special analysis of a special equation.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let us study some of the properties of linear differential
equations, having illustrated them already with the specific
equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI251">25.1</a>) that we have studied so closely. The first
property of interest is this: suppose that we have to solve the
differential equation for a transient, the free oscillation with no
driving force. That is, we want to solve
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:25:5}
\uL(x)=0.
\end{equation}
Suppose that, by some hook or crook, we have found a particular
solution, which we shall call $x_1$. That is, we have an $x_1$ for
which $\uL(x_1) = 0$. Now we notice that $ax_1$, is also a solution to
the same equation; we can multiply this special solution by any
constant whatever, and get a new solution. In other words, if we had a
motion of a certain “size,” then a motion twice as “big” is again
a solution. <em class="emph">Proof:</em> $\uL(ax_1) =$ $a\uL(x_1) =$ $a\cdot0 = 0$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Next, suppose that, by hook or by crook, we have not only found
<em class="emph">one</em> solution $x_1$, but also another solution, $x_2$. (Remember
that when we substituted $x = e^{i\alpha t}$ for finding the
transients, we found <em class="emph">two</em> values for $\alpha$, that is, two
solutions, $x_1$ and $x_2$.) Now let us show that the combination
$(x_1 + x_2)$ is also a solution. In other words, if we put $x = x_1 +
x_2$, $x$ is again a solution of the equation. Why?  Because, if
$\uL(x_1) = 0$ and $\uL(x_2) = 0$, then $\uL(x_1 + x_2) = \uL(x_1) +
\uL(x_2) = 0 + 0 = 0$. So if we have found a number of solutions for
the motion of a linear system we can add them together.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Combining these two ideas, we see, of course, that we can also add six
of one and two of the other: if $x_1$ is a solution, so is $\alpha
x_1$. Therefore any sum of these two solutions, such as $(\alpha x_1 +
\beta x_2)$, is also a solution. If we happen to be able to find three
solutions, then we find that any combination of the three solutions is
again a solution, and so on. It turns out that the number of what we
call <em class="emph">independent solutions</em><a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> that we have obtained for our oscillator problem is only
<em class="emph">two</em>. The number of independent solutions that one finds in the
general case depends upon what is called the number of <em class="emph">degrees
of freedom</em>. We shall not discuss this in
detail now, but if we have a second-order differential equation, there
are only two independent solutions, and we have found both of them; so
we have the most general solution.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let us go on to another proposition, which applies to the
situation in which the system is subjected to an outside
force. Suppose the equation is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:25:6}
\uL(x)=F(t),
\end{equation}
and suppose that we have found a special solution of it. Let us say
that Joe’s solution is $x_J$, and that $\uL(x_J) = F(t)$. Suppose we
want to find yet another solution; suppose we add to Joe’s solution
one of those that was a solution of the free equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI255">25.5</a>),
say $x_1$. Then we see by (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI253">25.3</a>) that
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}

<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{equation}

Therefore, to the “forced” solution we can add any “free”
solution, and we still have a solution. The free solution is called a
<em class="emph">transient</em> solution.</p>

<div id="Ch25-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">When we have no force acting, and suddenly turn one on, we do not
immediately get the steady solution that we solved for with the sine
wave solution, but for a while there is a transient which sooner or
later dies out, if we wait long enough. The “forced” solution does
not die out, since it keeps on being driven by the force. Ultimately,
for long periods of time, the solution is unique, but initially the
motions are different for different circumstances, depending on how
the system was started.</p>

with a certain $\omega = \omega_a$, but our conclusions will be true
for any functional form of $F_a$) and we have solved for the forced
motion (with or without the transients; it makes no difference). Now
suppose some other force is acting, let us say $F_b$, and we solve the
same problem, but for this different force. Then suppose someone comes
along and says, “I have a new problem for you to solve; I have the
force $F_a + F_b$.” Can we do it? Of course we can do it, because the
solution is the sum of the two solutions $x_a$ and $x_b$ for the
forces taken separately—a most remarkable circumstance indeed. If we

the following: if we have a complicated force which can be broken up

is in some way simple, in the sense that for each special piece into

Chapter <a href="I_12.html">12</a> we said that it was one of the great facts of
the laws of electricity that if we have a certain distribution of

these charges at a certain place $P$, and if, on the other hand, we
have another set of charges $q_b$ and we calculate the field $\FLPE_b$

distributions are present at the same time, the field $\FLPE$ at $P$
is the <em class="emph">sum</em> of $\FLPE_a$ due to one set plus $\FLPE_b$ due to
the other. In other words, if we know the field due to a certain
charge, then the field due to many charges is merely the vector sum of
the fields of these charges taken individually. This is exactly
analogous to the above proposition that if we know the result of two
given forces taken at one time, then if the force is considered as a
sum of them, the response is a sum of the corresponding individual
responses.</p>

<p class="p">As another interesting example of this proposition, let us ask how it is
possible to “tune in” to a particular radio station at the same time
as all the radio stations are broadcasting. The radio station transmits,
fundamentally, an oscillating electric field of very high frequency
which acts on our radio antenna. It is true that the amplitude of the
oscillation of the field is changed, modulated, to carry the signal of
the voice, but that is very slow, and we are not going to worry about
it. When one hears “This station is broadcasting at a frequency of
$780$ kilocycles,” this indicates that $780{,}000$ oscillations per
second is the frequency of the electric field of the station antenna,
and this drives the electrons up and down at that frequency in our
antenna. Now at the same time we may have another radio station in the
same town radiating at a different frequency, say $550$ kilocycles per
second; then the electrons in our antenna are also being driven by that
frequency.  Now the question is, how is it that we can separate the
signals coming into the one radio at $780$ kilocycles from those coming
in at $550$ kilocycles? We certainly do not hear both stations at the
same time.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">By the principle of superposition, the response of the electric
circuit in the radio, the first part of which is a linear circuit, to
the forces that are acting due to the electric field $F_a + F_b$,
is $x_a + x_b$. It therefore looks as though we will never disentangle
them. In fact, the very proposition of superposition seems to insist
that we cannot <em class="emph">avoid</em> having both of them in our system. But
remember, for a <em class="emph">resonant</em> circuit, the response curve, the
amount of $x$ per unit $F$, as a function of the frequency, looks like
Fig. <a href="#Ch25-F3">25–3</a>. If it were a very high $Q$ circuit, the
response would show a very sharp maximum. Now suppose that the two
stations are comparable in strength, that is, the two <em class="emph">forces</em>
are of the same magnitude. The <em class="emph">response</em> that we get is the sum
of $x_a$ and $x_b$. But, in Fig. <a href="#Ch25-F3">25–3</a>, $x_a$ is
tremendous, while $x_b$ is small. So, in spite of the fact that the
two signals are equal in strength, when they go through the sharp
resonant circuit of the radio tuned for $\omega_a$, the frequency of
the transmission of one station, then the response to this station is
much greater than to the other. Therefore the complete response, with
both signals acting, is almost all made up of $\omega_a$, and we have
selected the station we want.</p>

<div id="Ch25-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Now what about the tuning? How do we tune it? We change $\omega_0$ by
changing the $L$ or the $C$ of the circuit, because the frequency of
the circuit has to do with the combination of $L$ and $C$. In
particular, most radios are built so that one can change the
capacitance. When we retune the radio, we can make a new setting of
the dial, so that the natural frequency of the circuit is shifted,
say, to $\omega_c$. In those circumstances we hear neither one station
nor the other; we get silence, provided there is no other station at
frequency $\omega_c$. If we keep on changing the capacitance until the
resonance curve is at $\omega_b$, then of course we hear the other
station. That is how radio tuning works; it is again the principle of
superposition, combined with a resonant response.<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">To conclude this discussion, let us describe qualitatively what
happens if we proceed further in analyzing a linear problem with a
given force, when the force is quite complicated. Out of the many
possible procedures, there are two especially useful general ways that
we can solve the problem. One is this: suppose that we can solve it
for special known forces, such as sine waves of different
frequencies. We know it is child’s play to solve it for sine waves. So
we have the so-called “child’s play” cases. Now the question is
whether our very complicated force can be represented as the sum of
two or more “child’s play” forces. In Fig. <a href="#Ch25-F1">25–1</a> we
already had a fairly complicated curve, and of course we can make it
more complicated still if we add in more sine waves. So it is
certainly possible to obtain very complicated curves. And, in fact,
the reverse is also true: practically every curve can be obtained by
adding together <em class="emph">infinite numbers</em> of sine waves of different
wavelengths (or frequencies) for each one of which we know the
answer. We just have to know how much of each sine wave to put in to
make the given $F$, and then our answer, $x$, is the corresponding sum
of the $F$ sine waves, each multiplied by its effective ratio of $x$
to $F$. This method of solution is called the method of
<em class="emph">Fourier transforms</em>
or <em class="emph">Fourier analysis</em>. We are not going to actually carry
out such an analysis just now; we only wish to describe the idea
involved.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S2-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Another way in which our complicated problem can be solved is the
following very interesting one. Suppose that, by some tremendous
mental effort, it were possible to solve our problem for a special
force, namely an <em class="emph">impulse</em>. The force is quickly turned on and
then off; it is all over. Actually we need only solve for an impulse
of some unit strength, any other strength can be gotten by
multiplication by an appropriate factor. We know that the response $x$
for an impulse is a damped oscillation. Now what can we say about some
other force, for instance a force like that of Fig. <a href="#Ch25-F4">25–4</a>?</p>

<span class="tag">Fig. 25–4.</span>A complicated force may be treated as a succession of sharp
impulses.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S2-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Such a force can be likened to a succession of blows with a
hammer. First there is no force, and all of a sudden there is a steady
force—impulse, impulse, impulse, impulse, … and then it
stops. In other words, we imagine the continuous force to be a series
of impulses, very close together. Now, we know the result for an
impulse, so the result for a whole series of impulses will be a whole
series of damped oscillations: it will be the curve for the first
impulse, and then (slightly later) we add to that the curve for the
second impulse, and the curve for the third impulse, and so on. Thus
we can represent, mathematically, the complete solution for arbitrary
functions if we know the answer for an impulse. We get the answer for
any other force simply by integrating. This method is called the
<em class="emph">Green’s function method</em>. A Green’s function is a
response to an impulse, and the method of analyzing any force by putting
together the response of impulses is called the Green’s function
method.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S2-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">The physical principles involved in both of these schemes are so
simple, involving just the linear equation, that they can be readily
understood, but the <em class="emph">mathematical</em> problems that are involved,
the complicated integrations and so on, are a little too advanced for
us to attack right now. You will most likely return to this some day
when you have had more practice in mathematics. But the <em class="emph">idea</em> is
very simple indeed.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S2-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">Finally, we make some remarks on why <em class="emph">linear</em> systems are so
important. The answer is simple: because we can solve them! So most of
the time we solve linear problems. Second (and most important), it
turns out that <em class="emph">the fundamental laws of physics are often
linear</em>. The Maxwell equations for the laws of
electricity are linear,
for example. The great laws of quantum mechanics turn out, so far as
we know, to be linear equations. <em class="emph">That</em> is why we spend so much
time on linear equations: because if we understand linear equations,
we are ready, in principle, to understand a lot of things.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S2-p13" class="para">
<p class="p">We mention another situation where linear equations are found. When
displacements are small, many functions can be <em class="emph">approximated</em>
linearly. For example, if we have a simple pendulum, the correct
equation for its motion is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:25:9}
d^2\theta/dt^2=-(g/L)\sin\theta.
\end{equation}
This equation can be solved by elliptic functions, but the easiest way
to solve it is numerically, as was shown in Chapter <a href="I_09.html">9</a> on
Newton’s Laws of Motion. A nonlinear equation cannot be solved,
ordinarily, any other way <em class="emph">but</em> numerically. Now for small
$\theta$, $\sin\theta$ is practically equal to $\theta$, and we have a
linear equation. It turns out that there are many circumstances where
small effects are linear: for the example here the swing of a pendulum
through small arcs. As another example, if we pull a little bit on a
spring, the force is proportional to the extension. If we pull hard,
we break the spring, and the force is a completely different function
of the distance!  Linear equations are important. In fact they are so
important that perhaps fifty percent of the time we are solving linear
equations in physics and in engineering.</p>

<span class="tag">25–3</span>Oscillations in linear systems</h3>
<div id="Ch25-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Let us now review the things we have been talking about in the past
few chapters. It is very easy for the physics of oscillators to become
obscured by the mathematics. The physics is actually very simple, and
if we may forget the mathematics for a moment we shall see that we can
understand almost everything that happens in an oscillating
system. First, if we have only the spring and the weight, it is easy
to understand why the system oscillates—it is a consequence of
inertia. We pull the mass down and the force pulls it back up; as it
passes zero, which is the place it likes to be, it cannot just
suddenly stop; because of its momentum it keeps on going and swings to
the other side, and back and forth. So, if there were no friction, we
would surely <i>expect</i> an oscillatory motion, and indeed we get one. But
if there is even a little bit of friction, then on the return cycle,
the swing will not be quite as high as it was the first time.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now what happens, cycle by cycle? That depends on the kind and amount
of friction. Suppose that we could concoct a kind of friction force
that always remains in the same proportion to the other forces, of
inertia and in the spring, as the amplitude of oscillation varies. In
other words, for smaller oscillations the friction should be weaker
than for big oscillations. Ordinary friction does not have this
property, so a special kind of friction must be carefully invented for
the very purpose of creating a friction that is directly proportional
to the velocity—so that for big oscillations it is stronger and for
small oscillations it is weaker. If we happen to have that kind of
friction, then at the end of each successive cycle the system is in
the same condition as it was at the start, except a little bit
smaller. All the forces are smaller in the same proportion: the spring
force is reduced, the inertial effects are lower because the
accelerations are now weaker, and the friction is less too, by our
careful design. When we actually have that kind of friction, we find
that each oscillation is exactly the same as the first one, except
reduced in amplitude. If the first cycle dropped the amplitude, say,
to $90$ percent of what it was at the start, the next will drop it to
$90$ percent of $90$ percent, and so on: <em class="emph">the sizes of the
oscillations are reduced by the same fraction of themselves in every
cycle</em>. An exponential function is a curve which does just that. It
changes by the same factor in each equal interval of time. That is to
say, if the amplitude of one cycle, relative to the preceding one, is
called $a$, then the amplitude of the next is $a^2$, and of the next,
$a^3$. So the amplitude is some constant raised to a power equal to
the number of cycles traversed:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:25:10}
A=A_0a^n.
\end{equation}
But of course $n\propto t$, so it is perfectly clear that the general
solution will be some kind of an oscillation, sine or cosine $\omega
t$, times an amplitude which goes as $b^t$ more or less. But $b$ can
be written as $e^{-c}$, if $b$ is positive and less than $1$. So this
is why the solution looks like $e^{-ct}\cos\omega_0 t$. It is very
simple.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S3-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">What happens if the friction is not so artificial; for example,
ordinary rubbing on a table, so that the friction force is a certain
constant amount, and is independent of the size of the oscillation
that reverses its direction each half-cycle? Then the equation is no
longer linear, it becomes hard to solve, and must be solved by the
numerical method given in Chapter <a href="I_09.html">9</a>, or by considering
each half-cycle separately. The numerical method is the most powerful
method of all, and can solve any equation. It is only when we have a
simple problem that we can use mathematical analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S3-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Mathematical analysis is not the grand thing it is said to be; it
solves only the simplest possible equations. As soon as the equations
get a little more complicated, just a shade—they cannot be solved
analytically. But the numerical method, which was advertised at the
beginning of the course, can take care of any equation of physical
interest.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Next, what about the resonance curve? Why is there a resonance? First,
imagine for a moment that there is no friction, and we have something
which could oscillate by itself. If we tapped the pendulum just right
each time it went by, of course we could make it go like mad. But if
we close our eyes and do not watch it, and tap at arbitrary equal
intervals, what is going to happen? Sometimes we will find ourselves
tapping when it is going the wrong way. When we happen to have the
timing just right, of course, each tap is given at just the right
time, and so it goes higher and higher and higher. So without friction
we get a curve which looks like the solid curve in Fig. <a href="#Ch25-F5">25–5</a>
for different frequencies. Qualitatively, we understand the resonance
curve; in order to get the exact shape of the curve it is probably just
as well to do the mathematics. The curve goes toward infinity
as $\omega\to\omega_0$, where $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency of the
oscillator.</p>

<div id="Ch25-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Now suppose there is a little bit of friction; then when the
displacement of the oscillator is small, the friction does not affect
it much; the resonance curve is the same, except when we are near
resonance. Instead of becoming infinite near resonance, the curve is
only going to get so high that the work done by our tapping each time
is enough to compensate for the loss of energy by friction during the
cycle. So the top of the curve is rounded off—it does not go to
infinity. If there is more friction, the top of the curve is rounded
off still more. Now someone might say, “I thought the widths of the
curves depended on the friction.” That is because the curve is
usually plotted so that the top of the curve is called one
unit. However, the mathematical expression is even simpler to
understand if we just plot all the curves on the same scale; then all
that happens is that the friction cuts down the top! If there is less
friction, we can go farther up into that little pinnacle before the
friction cuts it off, so it looks relatively narrow. That is, the
higher the peak of the curve, the narrower the width at half the
maximum height.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S3-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Finally, we take the case where there is an enormous amount of
friction. It turns out that if there is too much friction, the system
does not oscillate at all. The energy in the spring is barely able to
move it against the frictional force, and so it slowly oozes down to
the equilibrium point.</p>

<span class="tag">25–4</span>Analogs in physics</h3>
<div id="Ch25-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">The next aspect of this review is to note that masses and springs are
not the only linear systems; there are others. In particular, there
are electrical systems called linear circuits, in which we find a
complete analog to mechanical systems. We did not learn exactly
<em class="emph">why</em> each of the objects in an electrical circuit works in the
way it does—that is not to be understood at the present moment; we
may assert it as an experimentally verifiable fact that they behave as
stated.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">For example, let us take the simplest possible circumstance. We have a
piece of wire, which is just a resistance, and we have applied to it a
difference in potential, $V$. Now the $V$ means this: if we carry a
charge $q$ through the wire from one terminal to another terminal, the
work done is $qV$. The higher the voltage difference, the more work
was done when the charge, as we say, “falls” from the high potential
end of the terminal to the low potential end. So charges release
energy in going from one end to the other. Now the charges do not
simply fly from one end straight to the other end; the atoms in the
wire offer some resistance to the current, and this resistance obeys
the following law for almost all ordinary substances: if there is a
current $I$, that is, so and so many charges per second tumbling down,
the number per second that comes tumbling through the wire is
proportional to how hard we push them—in other words, proportional
to how much voltage there is:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:25:11}
V=IR=R(dq/dt).
\end{equation}
The coefficient $R$ is called the <em class="emph">resistance</em>, and the equation is
called Ohm’s Law. The unit of
resistance is the
ohm; it is equal to one volt per ampere. In mechanical
situations, to get such a frictional force in proportion to the velocity
is difficult; in an electrical system it is very easy, and this law is
extremely accurate for most metals.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We are often interested in how much work is done per second, the power
loss, or the energy liberated by the charges as they tumble down the
wire. When we carry a charge $q$ through a voltage $V$, the work
is $qV$, so the work done per second would be $V(dq/dt)$, which is the
same as $VI$, or also $IR\cdot I= I^2 R$. This is called the
<em class="emph">heating loss</em>—this is how much heat is generated in the
resistance per second, by the conservation of energy. It is this heat
that makes an ordinary incandescent light bulb work.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Of course, there are other interesting properties of mechanical systems,
such as the mass (inertia), and it turns out that there is an electrical
analog to inertia also. It is possible to make something called an
<em class="emph">inductor</em>, having a property called
<em class="emph">inductance</em>, such that a current, once started through the
inductance, <em class="emph">does not want to stop</em>. It requires a voltage in order
to change the current! If the current is constant, there is no voltage
across an inductance. <span class="text smallcaps">dc</span> circuits do not know anything about
inductance; it is only when we <em class="emph">change</em> the current that the
effects of inductance show up. The equation is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:25:12}
V=L(dI/dt)=L(d^2q/dt^2),
\end{equation}
and the unit of inductance, called the <em class="emph">henry</em>, is such that one volt applied to an inductance of one henry
produces a change of one ampere per second in the current.
Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI2512">25.12</a>) is the analog of Newton’s law for
electricity, if we wish: $V$ corresponds to $F$, $L$ corresponds to $m$,
and $I$ corresponds to velocity! All of the consequent equations for the
two kinds of systems will have the same derivations because, in all the
equations, we can change any letter to its corresponding analog letter
and we get the same equation; everything we deduce will have a
correspondence in the two systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now what electrical thing corresponds to the mechanical spring, in
which there was a force proportional to the stretch? If we start with
$F= kx$ and replace $F\to V$ and $x\to q$, we get $V = \alpha q$. It
turns out that there <em class="emph">is</em> such a thing, in fact it is the only
one of the three circuit elements we can really understand, because we
did study a pair of parallel plates, and we found that if there were a
charge of certain equal, opposite amounts on each plate, the electric
field between them would be proportional to the size of the charge. So
the work done in moving a unit charge across the gap from one plate to
the other is precisely proportional to the charge. This work is the
<em class="emph">definition</em> of the voltage difference, and it is the line
integral of the electric field from one plate to another. It turns
out, for historical reasons, that the constant of proportionality is
not called $C$, but $1/C$. It could have been called $C$, but it was
not. So we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:25:13}
V=q/C.
\end{equation}
The unit of capacitance, $C$, is the farad; a
charge of one coulomb on each plate of a one-farad capacitor yields a
voltage difference of one volt.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S4-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">There are our analogies, and the equation corresponding to the
oscillating circuit becomes the following, by direct substitution of
$L$ for $m$, $q$ for $x$, etc:
\begin{alignat}{2}
\label{Eq:I:25:14}
m(d^2x/dt^2)&\,+\,\gamma m(dx/dt)+kx&&=F,\\[1.5ex]
\label{Eq:I:25:15}
L(d^2q/dt^2)&\,+\,R(dq/dt)+q/C&&=V.
\end{alignat}
Now everything we learned about (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI2514">25.14</a>) can be transformed
to apply to (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI2515">25.15</a>). Every <em class="emph">consequence</em> is the same;
so much the same that there is a brilliant thing we can do.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S4-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose we have a mechanical system which is quite complicated, not
just one mass on a spring, but several masses on several springs, all
hooked together. What do we do? Solve it? Perhaps; but look, we can
make an <em class="emph">electrical</em> circuit which will have the same equations
as the thing we are trying to analyze! For instance, if we wanted to
analyze a mass on a spring, why can we not build an electrical circuit
in which we use an inductance proportional to the mass, a resistance
proportional to the corresponding $m\gamma$, $1/C$ proportional
to $k$, all in the same ratio? Then, of course, this electrical circuit
will be the exact analog of our mechanical one, in the sense that
whatever $q$ does, in response to $V$ ($V$ also is made to correspond
to the forces that are acting), so the $x$ would do in response to the
force!  So if we have a complicated thing with a whole lot of
interconnecting elements, we can interconnect a whole lot of
resistances, inductances, and capacitances, to <em class="emph">imitate</em> the
mechanically complicated system. What is the advantage to that? One
problem is just as hard (or as easy) as the other, because they are
exactly equivalent. The advantage is not that it is any easier to
solve the <em class="emph">mathematical equations</em> after we discover that we have
an electrical circuit (although that <em class="emph">is</em> the method used by
electrical engineers!), but instead, the real reason for looking at
the analog is that it is easier to <em class="emph">make</em> the electrical circuit,
and to <em class="emph">change</em> something in the system.</p>

<div id="Ch25-S4-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose we have designed an automobile, and want to know how much it
is going to shake when it goes over a certain kind of bumpy road. We
build an electrical circuit with inductances to represent the inertia
of the wheels, spring constants as capacitances to represent the
springs of the wheels, and resistors to represent the shock absorbers,
and so on for the other parts of the automobile. Then we need a bumpy
road. All right, we apply a <em class="emph">voltage</em> from a generator, which
represents such and such a kind of bump, and then look at how the left
wheel jiggles by measuring the charge on some capacitor. Having
measured it (it is easy to do), we find that it is bumping too
much. Do we need more shock absorber, or less shock absorber? With a
complicated thing like an automobile, do we actually change the shock
absorber, and solve it all over again? No!, we simply turn a dial;
dial number ten is shock absorber number three, so we put in more
shock absorber. The bumps are worse—all right, we try less. The
bumps are still worse; we change the stiffness of the spring
(dial $17$), and we adjust all these things <em class="emph">electrically</em>, with merely
the turn of a knob.</p>

<span class="tag">25–5</span>Series and parallel impedances</h3>
<div id="Ch25-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Finally, there is an important item which is not quite in the nature
of review. This has to do with an electrical circuit in which there is
more than one circuit element. For example, when we have an inductor,
a resistor, and a capacitor connected as in Fig. <a href="I_24.html#Ch24-F2">24–2</a>,
we note that all the charge went through every one of the three, so
that the current in such a singly connected thing is the same at all
points along the wire. Since the current is the same in each one, the
voltage across $R$ is $IR$, the voltage across $L$ is $L(dI/dt)$, and
so on. So, the total voltage drop is the sum of these, and this leads
to Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI2515">25.15</a>). Using complex numbers, we found that we
could solve the equation for the steady-state motion in response to a
sinusoidal force. We thus found that $\hat{V}= \hat{Z}\hat{I}$. Now
$\hat{Z}$ is called the <em class="emph">impedance</em> of this particular circuit. It
tells us that if we apply a sinusoidal voltage, $\hat{V}$, we get a
current $\hat{I}$.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch25-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now suppose we have a more complicated circuit which has two pieces,
which by themselves have certain impedances, $\hat{Z}_1$
and $\hat{Z}_2$ and we put them in <em class="emph">series</em> (Fig. <a href="#Ch25-F6">25–6</a>a)
and apply a voltage. What happens?  It is now a little more complicated,
but if $\hat{I}$ is the current through $\hat{Z}_1$, the voltage
difference across $\hat{Z}_1$, is $\hat{V}_1=\hat{I}\hat{Z}_1$;
similarly, the voltage across $\hat{Z}_2$
is $\hat{V}_2=\hat{I}\hat{Z}_2$. <em class="emph">The same current goes through both</em>.
Therefore the total voltage is the sum of the voltages across the two
sections and is equal to $\hat{V}= \hat{V}_1 + \hat{V}_2 =(\hat{Z}_1 +
\hat{Z}_2)\hat{I}$. This means that the voltage on the complete circuit
can be written $\hat{V}=\hat{I}\hat{Z}_s$, where the $\hat{Z}_s$ of the
combined system in series is the sum of the two $\hat{Z}$’s of the
separate pieces:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:25:16}
\hat{Z}_s=\hat{Z}_1 + \hat{Z}_2.
\end{equation}</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch25-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">This is not the only way things may be connected. We may also connect
them in another way, called a <em class="emph">parallel</em> connection
(Fig. <a href="#Ch25-F6">25–6</a>b). Now we see that a given voltage across the
terminals, if the connecting wires are perfect conductors, is
effectively applied to both of the impedances, and will cause currents
in each independently. Therefore the current through $\hat{Z}_1$ is
equal to $\hat{I}_1 = \hat{V}/\hat{Z}_1$. The current in $\hat{Z}_2$
is $\hat{I}_2 = \hat{V}/\hat{Z}_2$. It is the <em class="emph">same voltage</em>. Now the
total current which is supplied to the terminals is the <em class="emph">sum</em> of
the currents in the two sections: $\hat{I}= \hat{V}/\hat{Z}_1 +
\hat{V}/\hat{Z}_2$. This can be written as
\begin{equation}
\hat{V}=\frac{\hat{I}}{(1/\hat{Z}_1)+(1/\hat{Z}_2)}=
\hat{I}\hat{Z}_p.\notag
\end{equation}
Thus
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:25:17}
1/\hat{Z}_p=1/\hat{Z}_1 + 1/\hat{Z}_2.
\end{equation}</p>

<div id="Ch25-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">More complicated circuits can sometimes be simplified by taking pieces of them,
working out the succession of impedances of the pieces, and combining the
circuit together step by step, using the above rules. If we have any kind of
circuit with many impedances connected in all kinds of ways, and if we include
the voltages in the form of little generators having no impedance (when we pass
charge through it, the generator adds a voltage $V$), then the following
principles apply: (1) At any junction, the sum of the currents into a junction
is zero. That is, all the current which comes in must come back out. (2) If we
carry a charge around any loop, and back to where it started, the net work done
is zero. These rules are called <em class="emph">Kirchhoff’s
laws</em> for electrical circuits. Their systematic
application to complicated circuits often simplifies the analysis of such
circuits. We mention them here in conjunction with Eqs.
(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI2516">25.16</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI2517">25.17</a>), in case you have already come across
such circuits that you need to analyze in laboratory work. They will be
discussed again in more detail next year.
