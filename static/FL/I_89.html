        Born in 1918 in New York City, Richard&nbsp;P. Feynman received his Ph.D from Princeton in 1942.
        Despite his youth, he played an important part in the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos during World
        War II. Subsequently, he taught at Cornell and at the California Institute of Technology. In 1965
        he received the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Julian Schwinger,
        for his work in quantum electrodynamics.

        Dr.&nbsp;Feynman won his Nobel Prize for successfully resolving problems with the theory of quantum
        electrodynamics. He also created a mathematical theory that accounts for the phenomenon of
        superfluidity in liquid helium. Thereafter, with Murray Gell-Mann, he did fundamental work in the
        area of weak interactions such as beta decay. In later years Feynman played a key role in the
        development of quark theory by putting forward his parton model of high energy proton collision
        processes.

        Feynman was a remarkably effective educator. Of all his numerous awards, he was especially proud of
        the Oersted Medal for Teaching, which he won in 1972. <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>,
        originally published in 1963, were described by a reviewer in Scientific American as &ldquo;tough, but
        nourishing and full of flavor. After 25 years it is <i>the</i> guide for teachers and for the best
        of beginning students.&rdquo; In order to increase the understanding of physics among the lay public,
        Dr.&nbsp;Feynman wrote <i>The Character of Physical Law</i> and <i>QED: The Strange Theory of Light and
        Matter</i>. He also authored a number of advanced publications that have become classic references
        and textbooks for researchers and students.

        Richard Feynman was a constructive public man. His work on the Challenger commission is well known,
        especially his famous demonstration of the susceptibility of the O-rings to cold, an elegant experiment
        which required nothing more than a glass of ice water and a C-clamp. Less well known were
        Dr.&nbsp;Feynman's efforts on the California State Curriculum Committee in the 1960s, where he protested
        the mediocrity of textbooks.

        lively and multi-sided personality shines through all his work. Besides being a physicist, he was at
        various times a repairer of radios, a picker of locks, an artist, a dancer, a bongo player, and even a
        decipherer of Mayan hieroglyphics. Perpetually curious about his world, he was an exemplary empiricist.

        Born in Detroit in 1919, Robert&nbsp;B. Leighton did ground-breaking work in solid state physics, cosmic ray physics, the beginnings of modern particle physics, solar physics, planetary photography, infrared astronomy, and millimeter- and submillimeter-wave astronomy over the course of his life. He was widely known for his innovative design of scientific instruments, and was deeply admired as a teacher, having authored a highly influential text, <i>Principles of Modern Physics</i>, before joining the team developing <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>.

        In the early 1950s Leighton played a key role in showing the mu-meson decays into two neutrinos and an electron, and  made the first measurement of the energy spectrum of the decay electron.  He was the first to observe strange particle decays after their initial discovery, and elucidated many of the properties of the new strange particles.

        In the mid-1950s Leighton devised Doppler-shift and Zeeman-effect solar cameras. With the Zeeman camera, Leighton and his students mapped the sun's magnetic field with excellent resolution, leading to striking discoveries of a five-minute oscillation in local solar surface velocities and of a “super-granulation pattern,” thus opening a new field: solar seismology. Leighton also designed and built equipment to make clearer images of the planets, and opened another new field: adaptive optics. His were considered the best images of the planets until the era of space exploration with probes began in the 1960s.

        In the early 1960s, Leighton developed a novel, inexpensive infrared telescope, producing the first survey of the sky at 2.2 microns, which revealed an unexpectedly large number of objects in our galaxy too cool to be seen with the human eye.  During the mid-1960s he was Team Leader at JPL for  Imaging Science Investigations on the Mariner 4, 6, and 7 missions to Mars. Leighton played a key role in the development of JPL's first deep-space digital television system, and contributed to early efforts at image processing and enhancement techniques.

        In the 1970s, Leighton's interest shifted to the development of large, inexpensive dish antennae that could be used to pursue millimeter-wave interferometry and submillimeter-wave astronomy.
