angstrom or so. That is, the atoms are large, relative to their spacing,
so that you would expect the mean free path between collisions to be of
the order of a few angstroms—which is practically nothing. You would
expect the electron to bump into one atom or another almost immediately.
Nevertheless, it is a ubiquitous phenomenon of nature that if the
lattice is perfect, the electrons are able to travel through the crystal
smoothly and easily—almost as if they were in a vacuum. This strange
fact is what lets metals conduct electricity so easily; it has also
permitted the development of many practical devices. It is, for
instance, what makes it possible for a transistor to imitate the radio
tube. In a radio tube electrons move freely through a vacuum, while in
the transistor they move freely through a crystal lattice. The machinery
behind the behavior of a transistor will be described in this chapter;
the next one will describe the application of these principles in
various practical devices.</p>

<p class="p">The conduction of electrons in a crystal is one example of a very common
phenomenon. Not only can electrons travel through crystals, but other
“things” like atomic excitations can also travel in a similar manner.
So the phenomenon which we want to discuss appears in many ways in the
study of the physics of the solid state.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">You will remember that we have discussed many examples of two-state
systems. Let’s now think of an electron which can be in either one of
two positions, in each of which it is in the same kind of
environment. Let’s also suppose that there is a certain amplitude to
go from one position to the other, and, of course, the same amplitude
to go back, just as we have discussed for the hydrogen molecular ion
in Section <a href="III_10.html#Ch10-S1">10–1</a>. The laws of quantum mechanics then
give the following results. There are two possible states of definite
energy for the electron. Each state can be described by the amplitude
for the electron to be in each of the two basic positions. In either
of the definite-energy states, the magnitudes of these two amplitudes
are constant in time, and the phases vary in time with the same
frequency. On the other hand, if we start the electron in one
position, it will later have moved to the other, and still later will
swing back again to the first position. The amplitude is analogous to
the motions of two coupled pendulums.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Now consider a perfect crystal lattice in which we imagine that an
electron can be situated in a kind of “pit” at one particular atom
and with some particular energy. Suppose also that the electron has
some amplitude to move into a different pit at one of the nearby
atoms. It is something like the two-state system—but with an
additional complication. When the electron arrives at the neighboring
atom, it can afterward move on to still another position as well as
return to its starting point. Now we have a situation analogous not to
<em class="emph">two</em> coupled pendulums, but to an <em class="emph">infinite number</em> of
pendulums all coupled together. It is something like what you see in
one of those machines—made with a long row of bars mounted on a
torsion wire—that is used in first-year physics to demonstrate wave
propagation.</p>

<div id="Ch13-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Usually, the simplest way of analyzing the mechanical problem is not
to think in terms of what happens if a pulse is started at a definite
place, but rather in terms of steady-wave solutions. There exist
certain patterns of displacements which propagate through the crystal
as a wave of a single, fixed frequency. Now the same thing happens
with the electron—and for the same reason, because it’s described in
quantum mechanics by similar equations.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">You must appreciate one thing, however; the amplitude for the electron
to be at a place is an <em class="emph">amplitude</em>, not a probability. If the
electron were simply leaking from one place to another, like water
going through a hole, the behavior would be completely different. For
example, if we had two tanks of water connected by a tube to permit
some leakage from one to the other, then the levels would approach
each other exponentially. But for the electron, what happens is
amplitude leakage and not just a plain probability leakage. And it’s a
characteristic of the imaginary term—the $i$ in the differential
equations of quantum mechanics—which changes the exponential
solution to an oscillatory solution. What happens then is quite
different from the leakage between interconnected tanks.

three-dimensional but the physics is very much the same; once you
understand the one-dimensional case you will be able to understand
what happens in three dimensions.) Next, we want to see what happens
if we put a single electron on this line of atoms. Of course, in a
real crystal there are already millions of electrons. But most of them
(nearly all for an insulating crystal) take up positions in some
pattern of motion each around its own atom—and everything is quite
stationary. However, we now want to think about what happens if we put
an <em class="emph">extra</em> electron in. We will not consider what the other ones
are doing because we suppose that to change their motion involves a
lot of excitation energy. We are going to add an electron as if to
produce one slightly bound negative ion. In watching what the

<p class="p">Now how do we describe such a system? What will be reasonable base
states? If you remember what we did when we had only two possible
positions, you can guess how it will go. Suppose that in our line of
atoms the spacings are all equal; and that we number the atoms in
sequence, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch13-F1">13–1</a>(a). One of the base states
is that the electron is at atom number $6$, another base state is that
the electron is at atom number $7$, or at atom number $8$, and so on. We
can describe the $n$th base state by saying that the electron is at atom
number $n$. Let’s say that this is the base state $\ket{n}$.

\begin{equation*}
\ket{n-1},\:\ket{n},\:\text{and }\:\ket{n+1}.

Using these base states, any state $\ket{\phi}$ of the electron in our
one-dimensional crystal can be described by giving all the
amplitudes $\braket{n}{\phi}$ that the state $\ket{\phi}$ is in one of the base
states—which means the amplitude that it is located at one
particular atom. Then we can write the state $\ket{\phi}$ as a
superposition of the base states

go in two steps. We’ll take that the amplitudes for the electron jump
from one atom to the next is $iA/\hbar$ (per unit time).</p>

the electron is leaking into the $n$th pit from the $(n+1)$st pit; and

<p class="p">We could study many things about an electron in a lattice, but first
let’s try to find the states of definite energy. As we have seen in
earlier chapters this means that we have to find a situation in which
the amplitudes all change at the same frequency if they change with
time at all. We look for solutions of the form
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:5}
C_n=a_ne^{-iEt/\hbar}.
\end{equation}

The complex numbers $a_n$ tell us about the non-time-varying part of
the amplitude to find the electron at the $n$th atom. If we put this
trial solution into the equations of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII134">13.4</a>) to test them
out, we get the result
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:6}
Ea_n=E_0a_n-Aa_{n+1}-Aa_{n-1}.

<div id="Ch13-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">All we have to do is take the determinant … but wait!
Determinants are fine when there are $2$, $3$, or $4$ equations. But
if there are a large number—or an infinite number—of equations,
the determinants are not very convenient. We’d better just try to
solve the equations directly. First, let’s label the atoms by their
<em class="emph">positions</em>; we’ll say that the atom $n$ is at $x_n$ and the
atom $(n+1)$ is at $x_{n+1}$. if the atomic spacing is $b$—as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch13-F1">13–1</a>—we will have that $x_{n+1}=x_n+b$. By choosing
our origin at atom zero, we can even have it that $x_n=nb$. We can
rewrite Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII135">13.5</a>) as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:7}
C_n=a(x_n)e^{-iEt/\hbar},
\end{equation}

and Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII136">13.6</a>) would become
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:8}
Ea(x_n)=E_0a(x_n)-Aa(x_{n+1})-Aa(x_{n-1}).
\end{equation}

Or, using the fact that $x_{n+1}=x_n+b$, we could also write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:9}
Ea(x_n)=E_0a(x_n)\!-\!Aa(x_n\!+b)\!-\!Aa(x_n\!-b).
\end{equation}

This equation is somewhat similar to a differential equation. It tells
us that a quantity, $a(x)$, at one point, ($x_n$), is related to the
same physical quantity at some neighboring points, ($x_n\pm b$). (A
differential equation relates the value of a function at a point to
the values at infinitesimally nearby points.) Perhaps the methods we
usually use for solving differential equations will also work here;
let’s try.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Linear differential equations with constant coefficients can always be
solved in terms of exponential functions. We can try the same thing
here; let’s take as a trial solution

Then Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII139">13.9</a>) becomes

\label{Eq:III:13:11}
Ee^{ikx_n}=E_0e^{ikx_n}-Ae^{ik(x_n+b)}-Ae^{ik(x_n-b)}.

We can now divide out the common factor $e^{ikx_n}$; we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:12}
E=E_0-Ae^{ikb}-Ae^{-ikb}.
\end{equation}

The last two terms are just equal to $(2A\cos kb)$, so
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:13}
E=E_0-2A\cos kb.
\end{equation}

We have found that for <em class="emph">any</em> choice at all for the constant $k$
there is a solution whose energy is given by this equation. There are
various possible energies depending on $k$, and each $k$ corresponds
to a different solution. There are an infinite number of

Fig. <a href="#Ch13-F2">13–2</a>. The envelope of these vertical lines (as shown
by the broken-line curve) is, of course, a cosine curve. The imaginary
part of $C_n$ is also an oscillating function, but is shifted $90^\circ$

one place than at some other place? We can do that by making a
superposition of several solutions like Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1314">13.14</a>) with
slightly different values of $k$—and, therefore, slightly different
energies. Then at $t=0$, at least, the amplitude $C_n$ will vary with
position because of the interference between the various terms, just as
one gets beats when there is a mixture of waves of different wavelengths
(as we discussed in Chapter <a href="I_48.html">48</a>, Vol. I). So we can make up
a “wave packet” with a predominant wave
number $k_0$, but with various other wave numbers
near $k_0$.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a></p>

<p class="p">In our superposition of stationary states, the amplitudes with
different $k$’s will represent states of slightly different energies, and,
therefore, of slightly different frequencies; the interference pattern
of the total $C_n$ will, therefore, also vary with time—there will be
a pattern of “beats.” As we have seen in Chapter <a href="I_48.html">48</a> of
Volume I, the peaks of the beats [the place where $\abs{C(x_n)}^2$ is
large] will move along in $x$ as time goes on; they move with the speed
we have called the “group velocity.” We found that this group velocity
was related to the variation of $k$ with frequency by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:17}
v_{\text{group}}=\ddt{\omega}{k};
\end{equation}
the same derivation would apply equally well here. An electron state
which is a “clump”—namely one for which the $C_n$ vary in space
like the wave packet of Fig. <a href="#Ch13-F5">13–5</a>—will move along our
one-dimensional “crystal” with the speed $v$ equal to $d\omega/dk$,
where $\omega=E/\hbar$. Using (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1316">13.16</a>) for $E$, we get
that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:18}
v=\frac{2Ab^2}{\hbar}\,k.
\end{equation}
In other words, the electrons move along with a speed proportional to
the typical $k$. Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1316">13.16</a>) then says that the
energy of such an electron is proportional to the square of its
velocity—<em class="emph">it acts like a classical particle</em>. So long as we
look at things on a scale gross enough that we don’t see the fine
structure, our quantum mechanical picture begins to give results like
classical physics. In fact, if we solve Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1318">13.18</a>)
for $k$ and substitute into (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1316">13.16</a>), we can write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:19}
E=\tfrac{1}{2}m_{\text{eff}}\,v^2,
\end{equation}
where $m_{\text{eff}}$ is a constant. The extra “energy of motion”
of the electron in a packet depends on the velocity just as for a
classical particle. The constant $m_{\text{eff}}$—called the
“effective mass”—is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:20}
m_{\text{eff}}=\frac{\hbar^2}{2Ab^2}.
\end{equation}
Also notice that we can write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:21}
m_{\text{eff}}\,v=\hbar k.
\end{equation}
If we choose to call $m_{\text{eff}}\,v$ the “momentum,” it is
related to the wave number $k$ in the way we have described earlier
for a free particle.</p>

<span class="tag">13–4</span>An electron in a three-dimensional lattice</h3>
<div id="Ch13-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s look for a moment at how we could apply the same ideas to see
what happens to an electron in three dimensions. The results turn out
to be very similar. Suppose we have a rectangular lattice of atoms
with lattice spacings of $a$, $b$, $c$ in the three directions. (If
you want a cubic lattice, take the three spacings all equal.) Also
suppose that the amplitude to leap in the $x$-direction to a neighbor
is $(iA_x/\hbar)$, to leap in the $y$-direction is $(iA_y/\hbar)$, and
to leap in the $z$-direction is $(iA_z/\hbar)$. Now how should we
describe the base states? As in the one-dimensional case, one base
state is that the electron is at the atom whose locations are $x$,
$y$, $z$, where $(x,y,z)$ is one of the lattice points. Choosing our
origin at one atom, these points are all at
\begin{equation*}
x=n_xa,\quad
y=n_yb,\quad
\text{and}\quad
z=n_zc,
\end{equation*}

where $n_x$, $n_y$, $n_z$ are any three integers. Instead of using
subscripts to indicate such points, we will now just use $x$, $y$,
and $z$, understanding that they take on only their values at the lattice
points. Thus the base state is represented by the
symbol $\ket{\text{electron at $x,y,z$}}$, and the amplitude for an electron
in some state $\ket{\psi}$ to be in this base state
is $C(x,y,z)=\braket{\text{electron at $x,y,z$}}{\psi}$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S4-p2" class="para">

<div id="Ch13-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Again we can try to find a stationary state in which all the $C$’s
vary with time in the same way. Again the solution is an exponential:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:23}
C(x,y,z)=e^{-iEt/\hbar}e^{i(k_xx+k_yy+k_zz)}.
\end{equation}

If you substitute this into (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1322">13.22</a>) you see that it
works, provided that the energy $E$ is related to $k_x$, $k_y$,
and $k_z$ in the following way:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:24}
E=E_0\!-\!2A_x\!\cos k_xa\!-\!2A_y\!\cos k_yb\!-\!2A_z\!\cos k_zc.
\end{equation}


The energy now depends on the <em class="emph">three</em> wave numbers $k_x$, $k_y$,
$k_z$, which, incidentally, are the components of a three-dimensional
vector $\FLPk$. In fact, we can write Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1323">13.23</a>) in
vector notation as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:25}
C(x,y,z)=e^{-iEt/\hbar}e^{i\FLPk\cdot\FLPr}.
\end{equation}

The amplitude varies as a complex <em class="emph">plane wave</em> in three
dimensions, moving in the direction of $\FLPk$, and with the wave
number $k=(k_x+k_y+k_z)^{1/2}$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">The energy associated with these stationary states depends on the
three components of $\FLPk$ in the complicated way given in

with $\FLPk$ depends on relative signs and magnitudes of $A_x$, $A_y$,
and $A_z$. If these three numbers are all positive, and if we are interested
in small values of $k$, the dependence is relatively simple.</p>

<div id="Ch13-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Expanding the cosines as we did before to get Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1316">13.16</a>),

E=E_{\text{min}}+Aa^2(k_x^2+k_y^2+k_z^2),\notag

or
\begin{equation}

Other energies are possible, but they belong to a different class of
electron states. For the states we have described, we imagined base
states in which an electron is placed on an atom of the crystal in
some particular state, say the lowest energy state.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">If you have an atom in empty space, and add an electron to make an ion,
the ion can be formed in many ways. The electron can go on in such a way
as to make the state of lowest energy, or it can go on to make one or
another of many possible “excited states” of the ion each with a definite
energy above the lowest energy. The same thing can happen in a crystal.
Let’s suppose that the energy $E_0$ we picked above corresponds to base
states which are ions of the lowest possible energy. We could also
imagine a new set of base states in which the electron sits near the
$n$th atom in a different way—in one of the excited states of the
ion—so that the energy $E_0$ is now quite a bit higher. As before
there is some amplitude $A$ (different from before) that the electron
will jump from its excited state at one atom to the same excited state
at a neighboring atom. The whole analysis goes as before; we find a band
of possible energies centered at a higher energy. There can, in general,
be many such bands each corresponding to a different level of
excitation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">There are also other possibilities. There may be some amplitude that
the electron jumps from an excited condition at one atom to an
unexcited condition at the next atom. (This is called an interaction
between bands.) The mathematical theory gets more and more complicated
as you take into account more and more bands and add more and more
coefficients for leakage between the possible states. No new ideas are
involved, however; the equations are set up much as we have done in
our simple example.</p>

for any particular real situation we can only take values determined
experimentally.</p>

<div id="Ch13-S5-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">There are other situations where the physics and mathematics are
almost exactly like what we have found for an electron moving in a
crystal, but in which the “object” that moves is quite
different. For instance, suppose that our original crystal—or rather
linear lattice—was a line of neutral atoms, each with a loosely
bound outer electron. Then imagine that we were to remove one
electron. Which atom has lost its electron? Let $C_n$ now represent
the amplitude that the electron <em class="emph">is missing</em> from the atom
at $x_n$. There will, in general, be some amplitude $iA/\hbar$ that the
electron at a neighboring atom—say the $(n-1)$st atom—will jump to
the $n$th leaving the $(n-1)$st atom without its electron. This is the
same as saying that there is an amplitude $A$ for the “missing
electron” to jump from the $n$th atom to the $(n-1)$st atom. You can
see that the equations will be exactly the same—of course, the value
of $A$ need not be the same as we had before. Again we will get the
same formulas for the energy levels, for the “waves” of probability
which move through the crystal with the group velocity of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1318">13.18</a>), for the effective mass, and so on. Only now
the waves describe the behavior of the <em class="emph">missing electron</em>—or
“hole” as it is called. So a “hole” acts just like a particle with a
certain mass $m_{\text{eff}}$. You can see that this particle will
appear to have a positive charge. We’ll have some more to say about such
holes in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="p">As another example, we can think of a line of identical <em class="emph">neutral</em>
atoms one of which has been put into an excited state—that is, with
more than its normal ground state energy. Let $C_n$ be the amplitude
that the $n$th atom has the excitation. It can interact with a
neighboring atom by handing over to it the extra energy and returning
to the ground state. Call the amplitude for this
process $iA/\hbar$. You can see that it’s the same mathematics all over
again. Now the object which moves is called an
<em class="emph">exciton</em>. It behaves like a neutral “particle”
moving through the crystal, carrying the excitation energy. Such motion
may be involved in certain biological processes such as
vision, or photosynthesis. It has been guessed that the
absorption of light in the retina produces an “exciton”
which moves through some periodic structure (such as the layers in the
rods we described in

imperfection or irregularity in the crystal. As an example, suppose
that somewhere in the crystal there is a missing atom; or suppose that
someone put one wrong atom at one of the atomic sites so that things

“zero” there is some probability that the electron is scattered
backwards. If a wave packet is moving along and it reaches a place
where things are a little bit different, some of it will continue
onward and some of it will bounce back. It’s quite difficult to
analyze such a situation using a wave packet, because everything
varies in time. It is much easier to work with steady-state

<p class="p">Remember that $E$ is given in terms of $k$ by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1330">13.30</a>).
If you substitute this value for $E$ into the equations, and remember
that $\cos x=\tfrac{1}{2}(e^{ix}+e^{-ix})$, you get from the first
equation that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:34}
a_0=1+\beta,
\end{equation}

and from the third equation that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:35}
a_0=\gamma.
\end{equation}

These are consistent only if
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:36}
\gamma=1+\beta.
\end{equation}
This equation says that the transmitted wave ($\gamma$) is just the
original incident wave ($1$) with an added wave ($\beta$) equal to the
reflected wave. This is not always true, but happens to be so for a
scattering at one atom only. If there were a clump of impurity atoms,
the amount added to the forward wave would not necessarily be the same
as the reflected wave.</p>

<p class="p">We can get the amplitude $\beta$ of the reflected wave from the middle
equation of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1333">13.33</a>); we find that

<p class="p">You may be wondering how the transmitted wave can be “more” than the
incident wave as it appears in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1334">13.34</a>). Remember,
though, that $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are complex numbers and that the
number of particles (or rather, the probability of finding a particle)
in a wave is proportional to the absolute square of the amplitude. In
fact, there will be “conservation of electrons” only if
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:38}
\abs{\beta}^2+\abs{\gamma}^2=1.

<div id="Ch13-S7-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">There is another interesting situation that can arise if $F$ is a
negative number. If the energy of the electron is lower at the
impurity atom (at $n=0$) than it is anywhere else, then the electron
can get caught on this atom. That is, if $(E_0+F)$ is below the bottom
of the band at $(E_0-2A)$, then the electron can get “trapped” in a
state with $E&lt;E_0-2A$. Such a solution cannot come out of what we have
done so far. We can get this solution, however, if we permit the trial
solution we took in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1310">13.10</a>) to have an imaginary
number for $k$. Let’s set $k=\pm i\kappa$. Again, we can have
different solutions for $n&lt;0$ and for $n&gt;0$. A possible solution
for $n&lt;0$ might be
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:39}
a_n\:(\text{for $n&lt;0$})=ce^{+\kappa x_n}.
\end{equation}

We have to take a plus sign in the exponent; otherwise the amplitude
would get indefinitely large for large negative values of $n$.
Similarly, a possible solution for $n&gt;0$ would be
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:40}
a_n\:(\text{for $n&gt;0$})=c'e^{-\kappa x_n}.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S7-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">If we put these trial solutions into Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1328">13.28</a>) all
but the middle three are satisfied provided that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:41}
E=E_0-A(e^{\kappa b}+e^{-\kappa b}).
\end{equation}

Since the sum of the two exponential terms is always greater than $2$,
this energy is below the regular band, and is what we are looking
for. The remaining three equations in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1328">13.28</a>) are
satisfied if $a_0=c=c'$ and if $\kappa$ is chosen so that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:42}
A(e^{\kappa b}-e^{-\kappa b})=-F.
\end{equation}

Combining this equation with Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1341">13.41</a>) we can find
the energy of the trapped electron; we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:43}
E=E_0-\sqrt{4A^2+F^2}.
\end{equation}

The trapped electron has a unique energy—located somewhat below the
conduction band.</p>

sits right on the impurity atom. The probability of finding the electron
at nearby atoms is given by the square of these amplitudes. For one
particular choice of the parameters it might vary as shown in the bar
graph of Fig. <a href="#Ch13-F7">13–7</a>. The probability is greatest for
finding the electron on the impurity atom. For nearby atoms the
probability drops off exponentially with the distance from the impurity
atom. This is another example of “barrier penetration.” From the
point-of-view of classical physics the electron doesn’t have enough
energy to get away from the energy “hole” at the trapping center. But
quantum mechanically it can leak out a little way.</p>

<span class="tag">13–8</span>Scattering amplitudes and bound states</h3>
<div id="Ch13-S8-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Finally, our example can be used to illustrate a point which is very
useful these days in the physics of high-energy particles. It has to
do with a relationship between scattering amplitudes and bound
states. Suppose we have discovered—through experiment and
theoretical analysis—the way that pions scatter from protons. Then a
new particle is discovered and someone wonders whether maybe it is
just a combination of a pion and a proton held together in some bound
state (in an analogy to the way an electron is bound to a proton to
make a hydrogen atom). By a bound state we mean a combination which
has a lower energy than the two free-particles.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S8-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">There is a general theory which says that a bound state will exist at
that energy at which the scattering amplitude becomes infinite if
extrapolated algebraically (the mathematical term is “analytically
continued”) to energy regions outside of the permitted band.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S8-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The physical reason for this is as follows. A bound state is a
situation in which there are only waves tied on to a point and there’s
no wave coming in to get it started, it just exists there by
itself. The relative proportion between the so-called “scattered” or
created wave and the wave being “sent in” is infinite. We can test
this idea in our example. Let’s write our expression
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1337">13.37</a>) for the scattered amplitude directly in terms
of the energy $E$ of the particle being scattered (instead of in terms
of $k$). Since Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1330">13.30</a>) can be rewritten as
\begin{equation*}
2A\sin kb=\sqrt{4A^2-(E-E_0)^2},
\end{equation*}

the scattered amplitude is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:44}
\beta=\frac{-F}{F-i\sqrt{4A^2-(E-E_0)^2}}.
\end{equation}

From our derivation, this equation should be used only for real states—those
with energies in the energy band, $E=E_0\pm2A$. But suppose we forget that fact
and extend the formula into the “unphysical” energy regions
where $\abs{E-E_0}&gt;2A$. For these unphysical regions we can write<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a>
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{4A^2-(E-E_0)^2}=i\sqrt{(E-E_0)^2-4A^2}.
\end{equation*}

Then the “scattering amplitude,” whatever it may mean, is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:13:45}
\beta=\frac{-F}{F+\sqrt{(E-E_0)^2-4A^2}}.
\end{equation}

Now we ask: Is there any energy $E$ for which $\beta$ becomes infinite
(i.e., for which the expression for $\beta$ has a “pole”)? Yes, so
long as $F$ is negative, the denominator of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1345">13.45</a>)
will be zero when
\begin{equation*}
(E-E_0)^2-4A^2=F^2,
\end{equation*}

or when
\begin{equation*}
E=E_0\pm\sqrt{4A^2+F^2}.
\end{equation*}
The minus sign gives just the energy we found in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1343">13.43</a>)
for the trapped energy.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch13-S8-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">What about the plus sign? This gives an energy <em class="emph">above</em> the
allowed energy band. And indeed there is another bound state there
which we missed when we solved the equations of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1328">13.28</a>). We leave it as a puzzle for you to find the
energy and amplitudes $a_n$ for this bound state.</p>
