<div id="Ch14-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">One of the remarkable and dramatic developments in recent
years has been the application of solid state science to technical
developments in electrical devices such as transistors. The study of
semiconductors led to the discovery of their useful properties and to a
large number of practical applications. The field is changing so rapidly
that what we tell you today may be incorrect next year. It will
certainly be incomplete. And it is perfectly clear that with the
continuing study of these materials many new and more wonderful things
will be possible as time goes on. You will not need to understand this
chapter for what comes later in this volume, but you may find it
interesting to see that at least something of what you are learning has
some relation to the practical world.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">There are large numbers of semiconductors known, but we’ll concentrate
on those which now have the greatest technical application. They are
also the ones that are best understood, and in understanding them we
will obtain a degree of understanding of many of the others. The
semiconductor substances in most common use today are silicon and
germanium. These elements crystallize in the diamond
lattice, a kind of cubic structure in which the
atoms have tetrahedral bonding with their four nearest neighbors. They
are insulators at very low temperatures—near absolute zero—although
they do conduct electricity somewhat at room temperature. They are not
metals; they are called <em class="emph">semiconductors</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">If we somehow put an extra electron into a crystal of silicon or
germanium which is at a low temperature, we will have just the
situation we described in the last chapter. The electron will be able
to wander around in the crystal jumping from one atomic site to the
next. Actually, we have looked only at the behavior of electrons in a
rectangular lattice, and the equations would be somewhat different for
the real lattice of silicon or germanium. All of the essential points
are, however, illustrated by the results for the rectangular lattice.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">As we saw in Chapter <a href="III_13.html">13</a>, these electrons can have
energies only in a certain energy band—called the <em class="emph">conduction
band</em>. Within this band the energy is related to the
wave-number $\FLPk$ of the probability amplitude $C$
(see Eq. (<a href="III_13.html#mjx-eqn-EqIII1324">13.24</a>)) by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:1}
E=\!E_0\!-\!2A_x\!\cos k_xa\!-\!2A_y\!\cos k_yb\!-\!2A_z\!\cos k_zc.
\end{equation}

The $A$’s are the amplitudes for jumping in the $x$-, $y$-,
and $z$-directions, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lattice spacings in
these directions.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">For energies near the bottom of the band, we can approximate
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII141">14.1</a>) by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:2}
E=E_{\text{min}}+A_xa^2k_x^2+A_yb^2k_y^2+A_zc^2k_z^2
\end{equation}

(see Section <a href="III_13.html#Ch13-S4">13–4</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">If we think of electron motion in some particular direction, so that
the components of $\FLPk$ are always in the same ratio, the energy is
a quadratic function of the wave number—and as we have seen of the
momentum of the electron. We can write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:3}
E=E_{\text{min}}+\alpha k^2,
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is some constant, and we can make a graph of $E$
versus $k$ as in Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F1">14–1</a>. We’ll call such a graph an
“energy diagram.” An electron in a particular
state of energy and momentum can be indicated by a point such as $S$ in
the figure.

<div id="Ch14-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">As we also mentioned in Chapter <a href="III_13.html">13</a>, we can have a similar
situation if we <em class="emph">remove</em> an electron from a neutral insulator.
Then, an electron can jump over from a nearby atom and fill the
“hole,” but leaving another “hole” at the atom it started from. We
can describe this behavior by writing an amplitude to find the
<em class="emph">hole</em> at any particular atom, and by saying that the <em class="emph">hole</em>
can jump from one atom to the next. (Clearly, the amplitudes $A$ that
the hole jumps from atom $a$ to atom $b$ is just the same as the
amplitude that an electron on atom $b$ jumps into the hole at atom $a$.)
The mathematics is just the same for the <em class="emph">hole</em> as it was for the
extra electron, and we get again that the energy of the hole is related
to its wave number by an equation just like Eq.
(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII141">14.1</a>) or (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII142">14.2</a>), except, of course, with
different numerical values for the amplitudes $A_x$, $A_y$, and $A_z$.
The hole has an energy related to the wave number of its probability
amplitudes. Its energy lies in a restricted band, and near the bottom of
the band its energy varies quadratically with the wave number—or
momentum—just as in Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F1">14–1</a>. Following the arguments
of Section <a href="III_13.html#Ch13-S3">13–3</a>, we would find that <em class="emph">the hole also
behaves like a classical particle</em> with a certain effective
mass—except that in noncubic crystals the mass depends on the
direction of motion. So the hole behaves like a <em class="emph">positive particle</em>
moving through the crystal. The charge of the hole-particle is positive,
because it is located at the site of a missing electron; and when it
moves in one direction there are actually electrons moving in the
opposite direction.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">If we put several electrons into a neutral crystal, they will move
around much like the atoms of a low-pressure gas. If there are not too
many, their interactions will not be very important. If we then put an
electric field across the crystal, the electrons will start to move
and an electric current will flow. Eventually they would all be drawn
to one edge of the crystal, and, if there is a metal electrode there,
they would be collected, leaving the crystal neutral.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Similarly we could put many holes into a crystal. They would roam
around at random unless there is an electric field. With a field they
would flow toward the negative terminal, and would be
“collected”—what actually happens is that they are neutralized by
electrons from the metal terminal.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">One can also have both holes and electrons together. If there are not
too many, they will all go their way independently. With an electric
field, they will all contribute to the current. For obvious reasons,
electrons are called the <em class="emph">negative carriers</em> and the holes are called the
<em class="emph">positive carriers</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">We have so far considered that electrons are put into the crystal from
the outside, or are removed to make a hole. It is also possible to
“create” an electron-hole pair by taking a bound electron away from
one neutral atom and putting it some distance away in the same
crystal. We then have a free electron and a free hole, and the two can
move about as we have described.</p>

<p class="p">The energy required to put an electron <em class="emph">into</em> a state $S$—we
say to “create” the state $S$—is the energy $E^-$ shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F2">14–2</a>. It is some energy above $E^-_{\text{min}}$. The
energy required to “create” a hole in some state $S'$ is the
energy $E^+$ of Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F3">14–3</a>, which is some energy greater
than $E^+_{\text{min}}$. Now if we create a pair in the states $S$ and $S'$,
the energy required is just $E^-+E^+$.</p>

<p class="p">The creation of pairs is a common process (as we will see later), so
many people like to put Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F2">14–2</a> and

<em class="emph">hole</em> energy plotted <em class="emph">downward</em>, although it is, of course a
<em class="emph">positive</em> energy. We have combined our two graphs in this way in
Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F4">14–4</a>. The advantage of such a graph is that the
energy $E_{\text{pair}}=E^-+E^+$ required to create a pair with the
electron in $S$ and the hole in $S'$ is just the vertical distance
between $S$ and $S'$ as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F4">14–4</a>. The minimum
energy required to create a pair is called the “gap” energy and is
equal to $E^-_{\text{min}}+E^+_{\text{min}}$.</p>

<p class="p">How can electron-hole pairs be created? There are several ways. For
example, photons of light (or x-rays) can be absorbed and create a
pair if the photon energy is above the energy of the gap. The rate at
which pairs are produced is proportional to the light intensity. If
two electrodes are plated on a wafer of the crystal and a “bias”
voltage is applied, the electrons and holes will be drawn to the
electrodes. The circuit current will be proportional to the intensity
of the light. This mechanism is responsible for the phenomenon of
photoconductivity and the operation of photoconductive cells.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p16" class="para">
<p class="p">Electron hole pairs can also be produced by high-energy
particles. When a fast-moving charged particle—for instance, a
proton or a pion with an energy of tens or hundreds of MeV—goes
through a crystal, its electric field will knock electrons out of
their bound states creating electron-hole pairs. Such events occur
hundreds of thousands of times per millimeter of track. After the
passage of the particle, the carriers can be collected and in doing so
will give an electrical pulse. This is the mechanism at play in the
semiconductor counters recently put to use for experiments in nuclear
physics. Such counters do not require semiconductors, they can also be
made with crystalline insulators. In fact, the first of such counters
was made using a diamond crystal which is an insulator at room
temperature. Very pure crystals are required if the holes and
electrons are to be able to move freely to the electrodes without
being trapped. The semiconductors silicon and germanium are used
because they can be produced with high purity in reasonable large
sizes (centimeter dimensions).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p17" class="para">
<p class="p">So far we have been concerned with semiconductor crystals at
temperatures near absolute zero. At any finite temperature there is
still another mechanism by which electron-hole pairs can be
created. The pair energy can be provided from the thermal energy of
the crystal. The thermal vibrations of the crystal can transfer their
energy to a pair—giving rise to “spontaneous” creation.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p18" class="para">
<p class="p">The probability per unit time that the energy as large as the gap
energy $E_{\text{gap}}$ will be concentrated at one atomic site is
proportional to $e^{-E_{\text{gap}}/\kappa T}$, where $T$ is the
temperature and $\kappa$ is Boltzmann’s
constant (see
Chapter <a href="I_40.html">40</a>, Vol. I). Near absolute zero there is no
appreciable probability, but as the temperature rises there is an
increasing probability of producing such pairs. At any finite
temperature the production should continue forever at a constant rate
giving more and more negative and positive carriers. Of course that does
not happen because after a while the electrons and holes accidentally
find each other—the electron drops into the hole and the excess energy
is given to the lattice. We say that the electron and hole
“annihilate.” There is a certain probability per second that a hole
meets an electron and the two things annihilate each other.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p19" class="para">
<p class="p">If the number of electrons per unit volume is $N_n$ ($n$ for negative
carriers) and the density of positive carriers is $N_p$, the chance
per unit time that an electron and a hole will find each other and
annihilate is proportional to the product $N_nN_p$. In equilibrium
this rate must equal the rate that pairs are created. You see that in
equilibrium the product of $N_n$ and $N_p$ should be given by some
constant times the Boltzmann factor:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:4}
N_nN_p=\text{const}\,e^{-E_{\text{gap}}/\kappa T}.
\end{equation}

When we say constant, we mean nearly constant. A more complete
theory—which includes more details about how holes and electrons
“find” each other—shows that the “constant” is slightly
dependent upon temperature, but the major dependence on temperature is
in the exponential.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p20" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s consider, as an example, a pure material which is originally
neutral. At a finite temperature you would expect the number of
positive and negative carriers to be equal, $N_n=N_p$. Then each of
them should vary with temperature as $e^{-E_{\text{gap}}/2\kappa
T}$. The variation of many of the properties of a semiconductor—the
conductivity for example—is mainly determined by the exponential
factor because all the other factors vary much more slowly with
temperature. The gap energy for germanium is about $0.72$ eV and for
silicon $1.1$ eV.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S1-p21" class="para">
<p class="p">At room temperature $\kappa T$ is about $1/40$ of an electron volt. At
these temperatures there are enough holes and electrons to give a
significant conductivity, while at, say, $30^\circ$K—one-tenth of
room temperature—the conductivity is imperceptible. The gap energy
of diamond is $6$ or $7$ eV and diamond is a good insulator at room
temperature.</p>

<span class="tag">14–2</span>Impure semiconductors</h3>
<div id="Ch14-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">So far we have talked about two ways that extra electrons can be put
into an otherwise ideally perfect crystal lattice. One way was to
inject the electron from an outside source; the other way, was to
knock a bound electron off a neutral atom creating simultaneously an
electron and a hole. It is possible to put electrons into the
conduction band of a crystal in still another way. Suppose we imagine
a crystal of germanium in which one of the germanium atoms is replaced
by an arsenic atom. The germanium atoms have a valence of $4$ and the
crystal structure is controlled by the four valence
electrons. Arsenic, on the other hand, has a valence of $5$. It turns
out that a single arsenic atom can sit in the germanium lattice
(because it has approximately the correct size), but in doing so it
must act as a valence $4$ atom—using four of its valence electrons
to form the crystal bonds and having one electron left over. This
extra electron is very loosely attached—the binding energy is only
about $1/100$ of
an electron
volt. At room temperature the electron easily picks
up that much energy from the thermal energy of the crystal, and then
takes off on its own—moving about in the lattice as a free
electron. An impurity atom such as the arsenic is called a <em class="emph">donor
site</em> because it can give up a negative carrier to the
crystal. If a crystal of germanium is grown from a melt to which a very
small amount of arsenic has been added, the arsenic donor sites will be
distributed throughout the crystal and the crystal will have a certain
density of negative carriers built in.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">You might think that these carriers would get swept away as soon as
any small electric field was put across the crystal. This will not
happen, however, because the arsenic atoms in the body of the crystal
each have a positive charge. If the body of the crystal is to remain
neutral, the average density of negative carrier electrons must be
equal to the density of donor sites. If you put two electrodes on the
edges of such a crystal and connect them to a battery, a current will
flow; but as the carrier electrons are swept out at one end, new
conduction electrons must be introduced from the electrode on the
other end so that the average density of conduction electrons is left
very nearly equal to the density of donor sites.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Since the donor sites are positively charged, there will be some
tendency for them to capture some of the conduction electrons as they
diffuse around inside the crystal. A donor site can, therefore, act as
a trap such as those we discussed in the last section. But if the
trapping energy is sufficiently small—as it is for arsenic—the
number of carriers which are trapped at any one time is a small
fraction of the total. For a complete understanding of the behavior of
semiconductors one must take into account this trapping. For the rest
of our discussion, however, we will assume that the trapping energy is
sufficiently low and the temperature is sufficiently high, that all of
the donor sites have given up their electrons. This is, of course,
just an approximation.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">It is also possible to build into a germanium crystal some impurity
atom whose valence is $3$, such as aluminum. The aluminum atom tries
to act as a valence $4$ object by stealing an extra electron. It can
steal an electron from some nearby germanium atom and end up as a
negatively charged atom with an effective valence of $4$. Of course,
when it steals the electron from a germanium atom, it leaves a hole
there; and this hole can wander around in the crystal as a positive
carrier. An impurity atom which can produce a hole in this way is
called an <em class="emph">acceptor</em> because it “accepts” an
electron. If a germanium or a silicon crystal is grown from a melt to
which a small amount of aluminum impurity has been added, the crystal
will have built-in a certain density of holes which can act as positive
carriers.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">When a donor or an acceptor impurity is added to a semiconductor, we
say that the material has been “doped.”</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">When a germanium crystal with some built-in donor impurities is at
room temperature, some conduction electrons are contributed by the
thermally induced electron-hole pair creation as well as by the donor
sites. The electrons from both sources are, naturally, equivalent, and
it is the total number $N_n$ which comes into play in the statistical
processes that lead to equilibrium. If the temperature is not too low,
the number of negative carriers contributed by the donor impurity
atoms is roughly equal to the number of impurity atoms present. In
equilibrium Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII144">14.4</a>) must still be valid; at a given
temperature the product $N_nN_p$ is determined. This means that if we
add some donor impurity which increases $N_n$, the number $N_p$ of
positive carriers will have to decrease by such an amount that
$N_nN_p$ is unchanged. If the impurity concentration is high enough,
the number $N_n$ of negative carriers is determined by the number of
donor sites and is nearly independent of temperature—all of the
variation in the exponential factor is supplied by $N_p$, even though
it is much less than $N_n$. An otherwise pure crystal with a small
concentration of donor impurity will have a majority of negative
carriers; such a material is called an “$n$-type”
semiconductor.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">If an acceptor-type impurity is added to the crystal lattice, some of
the new holes will drift around and annihilate some of the free
electrons produced by thermal fluctuation. This process will go on until
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII144">14.4</a>) is satisfied. Under equilibrium conditions the
number of positive carriers will be increased and the number of negative
carriers will be decreased, leaving the product a constant. A material
with an excess of positive carriers is called a “$p$-type”
semiconductor.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">If we put two electrodes on a piece of semiconductor crystal and
connect them to a source of potential difference, there will be an
electric field inside the crystal. The electric field will cause the
positive and the negative carriers to move, and an electric current
will flow. Let’s consider first what will happen in an $n$-type
material in which there is a large majority of negative carriers. For
such material we can disregard the holes; they will contribute very
little to the current because there are so few of them. In an ideal
crystal the carriers would move across without any impediment. In a
real crystal at a finite temperature, however,—especially in a
crystal with some impurities—the electrons do not move completely
freely. They are continually making collisions which knock them out of
their original trajectories, that is, changing their momentum. These
collisions are just exactly the scatterings we talked about in the
last chapter and occur at any irregularity in the crystal lattice. In
an $n$-type material the main causes of scattering are the very donor
sites that are producing the carriers. Since the conduction electrons
have a very slightly different energy at the donor sites, the
probability waves are scattered from that point. Even in a perfectly
pure crystal, however, there are (at any finite temperature)
irregularities in the lattice due to thermal vibrations. From the
classical point of view we can say that the atoms aren’t lined up
exactly on a regular lattice, but are, at any instant, slightly out of
place due to their thermal vibrations. The energy $E_0$ associated
with each lattice point in the theory we described in
Chapter <a href="III_13.html">13</a> varies a little bit from place to place so that
the waves of probability amplitude are not transmitted perfectly but are
scattered in an irregular fashion. At very high temperatures or for very
pure materials this scattering may become important, but in most doped
materials used in practical devices the impurity atoms contribute most
of the scattering. We would like now to make an estimate of the
electrical conductivity of such a material.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S2-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">When an electric field is applied to an $n$-type semiconductor, each
negative carrier will be accelerated in this field, picking up
velocity until it is scattered from one of the donor sites. This means
that the carriers which are ordinarily moving about in a random
fashion with their thermal energies will pick up an average drift
velocity along the lines of the electric field and give rise to a
current through the crystal. The drift velocity is in general rather
small compared with the typical thermal velocities so that we can
estimate the current by assuming that the average time that the
carrier travels between scatterings is a constant. Let’s say that the
negative carrier has an effective electric charge $q_n$. In an
electric field $\Efieldvec$, the force on the carrier will
be $q_n\Efieldvec$. In Section <a href="I_43.html#Ch43-S3">43–3</a> of Volume I we
calculated the average drift velocity under such circumstances and found
that it is given by $F\tau/m$, where $F$ is the force on the charge,
$\tau$ is the mean free time between collisions, and $m$ is the mass. We
should use the effective mass we calculated in the last chapter but
since we want to make a rough calculation we will suppose that this
effective mass is the same in all directions. Here we will call
it $m_n$. With this approximation the average drift velocity will be
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:5}
\FLPv_{\text{drift}}=\frac{q_n\Efieldvec\tau_n}{m_n}.
\end{equation}

Knowing the drift velocity we can find the current. Electric current
density $\FLPj$ is just the number of carriers per unit volume, $N_n$,
multiplied by the average drift velocity, and by the charge on each
carrier. The current density is therefore
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:6}
\FLPj=N_n\FLPv_{\text{drift}}q_n=
\frac{N_nq_n^2\tau_n}{m_n}\,\Efieldvec.
\end{equation}

We see that the current density is proportional to the electric field;
such a semiconductor material obeys Ohm’s law. The coefficient of
proportionality between $\FLPj$ and $\Efieldvec$, the
conductivity $\sigma$, is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:7}
\sigma=\frac{N_nq_n^2\tau_n}{m_n}.
\end{equation}

For an $n$-type material the conductivity is relatively independent of
temperature. First, the number of majority carriers $N_n$ is
determined primarily by the density of donors in the crystal (so long
as the temperature is not so low that too many of the carriers are
trapped). Second, the mean time between collisions $\tau_n$ is mainly
controlled by the density of impurity atoms, which is, of course,
independent of the temperature.</p>

<div id="Ch14-S2-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">We can apply all the same arguments to a $p$-type material, changing
only the values of the parameters which appear in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII147">14.7</a>). If there are comparable numbers of both
negative and positive carriers present at the same time, we must add the
contributions from each kind of carrier. The total conductivity will be
given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:8}
\sigma=\frac{N_nq_n^2\tau_n}{m_n}+\frac{N_pq_p^2\tau_p}{m_p}.

<p class="p">It is certainly a peculiar thing that in a substance where the only
relatively free objects are electrons, there should be an electrical
current carried by holes that behave like positive particles. We would
like, therefore, to describe an experiment that shows in a rather
clear way that the sign of the carrier of electric current is quite
definitely positive. Suppose we have a block made of semiconductor
material—it could also be a metal—and we put an electric field on
it so as to draw a current in some direction, say the horizontal
direction as drawn in Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F6">14–6</a>. Now suppose we put a magnetic field
on the block pointing at a right angle to the current, say <em class="emph">into</em>
the plane of the figure. The moving carriers will feel a magnetic
force $q(\FLPv\times\FLPB)$. And since the average drift velocity is
either right or left—depending on the sign of the charge on the
carrier—the average magnetic force on the carriers will be either up
or down. No, that is not right! For the directions we have assumed for
the current and the magnetic field the magnetic force on the moving
charges will always be <em class="emph">up</em>. Positive charges moving in the
direction of $\FLPj$ (to the right) will feel an upward force. If the
current is carried by negative charges, they will be moving left (for
the same sign of the conduction current) and they will also feel an
upward force. Under steady conditions, however, there is no upward
motion of the carriers because the current can flow only from left to
right. What happens is that a few of the charges initially flow
upward, producing a surface charge density along the upper surface of
semiconductor—leaving an equal and opposite surface charge density
along the bottom surface of the crystal. The charges pile up on the
top and bottom surfaces until the electric forces they produce on the
moving charges just exactly cancel the magnetic force (on the average)
so that the steady current flows horizontally. The charges on the top
and bottom surfaces will produce a potential difference vertically
across the crystal which can be measured with a high-resistance
voltmeter, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F7">14–7</a>. The sign of the potential
difference registered by the voltmeter will depend on the sign of the
carrier charges responsible for the current.</p>

<p class="p">When such experiments were first done it was expected that the sign of
the potential difference would be negative as one would expect for
negative conduction electrons. People were, therefore, quite surprised
to find that for some materials the sign of the potential difference
was in the opposite direction. It appeared that the current carrier
was a particle with a positive charge. From our discussion of doped
semiconductors it is understandable that an $n$-type semiconductor
should produce the sign of potential difference appropriate to
negative carriers, and that a $p$-type semiconductor should give an
opposite potential difference, since the current is carried by the
positively charged holes.</p>

<p class="p">The original discovery of the anomalous sign of the potential
difference in the Hall effect was made in a metal rather than a
semiconductor. It had been assumed that in metals the conduction was
always by electron; however, it was found out that for beryllium the
potential difference had the wrong sign. It is now understood that in
metals as well as in semiconductors it is possible, in certain
circumstances, that the “objects” responsible for the conduction are
holes. Although it is ultimately the electrons in the crystal which do
the moving, nevertheless, the relationship of the momentum and the
energy, and the response to external fields is exactly what one would
expect for an electric current carried by positive particles.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S3-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s see if we can make a quantitative estimate of the magnitude of
the voltage difference expected from the Hall effect. If the voltmeter
in Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F7">14–7</a> draws a negligible current, then the charges inside the
semiconductor must be moving from left to right and the vertical
magnetic force must be precisely cancelled by a vertical electric
field which we will call $\Efieldvec_{\text{tr}}$ (the “tr” is for
“transverse”). If this electric field is to cancel the magnetic
forces, we must have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:9}
\Efieldvec_{\text{tr}}=-\FLPv_{\text{drift}}\times\FLPB.
\end{equation}

Using the relation between the drift velocity and the electric current
density given in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII146">14.6</a>), we get
\begin{equation*}
\Efield_{\text{tr}}=-\frac{1}{qN}\,jB.
\end{equation*}

The potential difference between the top and the bottom of the crystal
is, of course, this electric field strength multiplied by the height
of the crystal. The electric field strength $\Efield_{\text{tr}}$ in
the crystal is proportional to the current density and to the magnetic
field strength. The constant of proportionality $1/qN$ is called the
Hall coefficient and is usually represented by the
symbol $R_{\text{H}}$. The Hall coefficient depends just on the density of
carriers—provided that carriers of one sign are in a large
majority. Measurement of the Hall effect is, therefore, one convenient
way of determining experimentally the density of carriers in a
semiconductor.</p>

<p class="p">We would like to discuss now what happens if we take two pieces of
germanium or silicon with different internal characteristics—say
different kinds or amounts of doping—and put them together to make a
“junction.” Let’s start out with what is called a $p$-$n$ junction
in which we have $p$-type germanium on one side of the boundary and
$n$-type germanium on the other side of the boundary—as sketched in
Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F8">14–8</a>. Actually, it is not practical to put together two
separate pieces of crystal and have them in uniform contact on an
atomic scale. Instead, junctions are made out of a single crystal
which has been modified in the two separate regions. One way is to add
some suitable doping impurity to the “melt” after only half of the
crystal has grown. Another way is to paint a little of the impurity
element on the surface and then heat the crystal causing some impurity
atoms to diffuse into the body of the crystal. Junctions made in these
ways do not have a sharp boundary, although the boundaries can be made
as thin as $10^{-4}$ centimeters or so. For our discussions we will
imagine an ideal situation in which these two regions of the crystal
with different properties meeting at a sharp boundary.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">On the $n$-type side of the $p$-$n$ junction there are free electrons
which can move about, as well as the fixed donor sites which balance
the overall electric charge. On the $p$-type side there are free holes
moving about and an equal number of negative acceptor sites keeping
the charge balanced. Actually, that describes the situation before we
put the two materials in contact. Once they are connected together the
situation will change near the boundary. When the electrons in the
$n$-type material arrive at the boundary they will not be reflected
back as they would at a free surface, but are able to go right on into
the $p$-type material. Some of the electrons of the $n$-type material
will, therefore, tend to diffuse over into the $p$-type material where
there are fewer electrons. This cannot go on forever because as we
lose electrons from the $n$-side the net positive charge there
increases until finally an electric voltage is built up which retards
the diffusion of electrons into the $p$-side. In a similar way, the
positive carriers of the $p$-type material can diffuse across the
junction into the $n$-type material. When they do this they leave
behind an excess of negative charge. Under equilibrium conditions the
net diffusion current must be zero. This is brought about by the
electric fields, which are established in such a way as to draw the
positive carriers back toward the $p$-type material.</p>

<p class="p">The two diffusion processes we have been describing go on
simultaneously and, you will notice, both act in the direction which
will charge up the $n$-type material in a positive sense and the
$p$-type material in a negative sense. Because of the finite
conductivity of the semiconductor material, the change in potential
from the $p$-side to the $n$-side will occur in a relatively narrow
region near the boundary; the main body of each block of material will
have a uniform potential. Let’s imagine an $x$-axis in a direction
perpendicular to the boundary surface. Then the electric potential
will vary with $x$, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F9">14–9</a>(b). We have also shown in
part (c) of the figure the expected variation of the density $N_n$ of
$n$-carriers and the density $N_p$ of $p$-carriers. Far away from the
junction the carrier densities $N_p$ and $N_n$ should be just the
equilibrium density we would expect for individual blocks of materials
at the same temperature. (We have drawn the figure for a junction in
which the $p$-type material is more heavily doped than the $n$-type
material.) Because of the potential gradient at the junction, the
positive carriers have to climb up a potential hill to get to the
$n$-type side. This means that under equilibrium conditions there can
be fewer positive carriers in the $n$-type material than there are in
the $p$-type material. Remembering the laws of statistical mechanics,
we expect that the ratio of $p$-type carriers on the two sides to be
given by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:10}
\frac{N_p(\text{$n$-side})}{N_p(\text{$p$-side})}=
e^{-q_pV/\kappa T}.

The product $q_pV$ in the numerator of the exponential is just the
energy required to carry a charge of $q_p$ through a potential
difference $V$.</p>

If we know the equilibrium densities in each of the two materials, we
can use either of the two equations above to determine the potential

(Remember that $q_n=-q_p$.) We have seen earlier, however, that this product depends only on the temperature and the gap energy of the crystal. Provided both sides of the crystal are at the same temperature, the two equations are consistent with the same value of the potential difference.

<div id="Ch14-S4-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Since there is a potential difference from one side of the junction to
the other, it looks something like a battery. Perhaps if we connect a
wire from the $n$-type side to the $p$-type side we will get an
electrical current. That would be nice because then the current would
flow forever without using up any material and we would have an
infinite source of energy in violation of the second law of
thermodynamics!  There is, however, no current if you connect a wire
from the $p$-side to the $n$-side. And the reason is easy to
see. Suppose we imagine first a wire made out of a piece of undoped
material. When we connect this wire to the $n$-type side, we have a
junction. There will be a potential difference across this
junction. Let’s say that it is just one-half the potential difference
from the $p$-type material to the $n$-type material. When we connect
our undoped wire to the $p$-type side of the junction, there is also a
potential difference at this junction—again, one-half the potential
drop across the $p$-$n$ junction. At all the junctions the potential
differences adjust themselves so that there is no net current flow in
the circuit. Whatever kind of wire you use to connect together the two
sides of the $n$-$p$ junction, you are producing two new junctions,
and so long as all the junctions are at the same temperature, the
potential jumps at the junctions all compensate each other and no
current will flow in the circuit. It does turn out, however—if you
work out the details—that if some of the junctions are at a
different temperature than the other junctions, currents will
flow. Some of the junctions will be heated and others will be cooled
by this current and thermal energy will be converted into electrical
energy. This effect is responsible for the operation of thermocouples
which are used for measuring temperatures, and of thermoelectric
generators. The same effect is also used to make small refrigerators.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S4-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">If we cannot measure the potential difference between the two sides of
an $n$-$p$ junction, how can we really be sure that the potential
gradient shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F9">14–9</a> really exists? One way is to
shine light on the junction. When the light photons are absorbed they
can produce an electron-hole pair. In the strong electric field that
exists at the junction (equal to the slope of the potential curve of
Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F9">14–9</a>) the hole will be driven into the $p$-type
region and the electron will be driven into the $n$-type region. If the
two sides of the junction are now connected to an external circuit,
these extra charges will provide a current. The energy of the light will
be converted into electrical energy in the junction. The solar cells
which generate electrical power for the operation of some of our
satellites operate on this principle.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S4-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">In our discussion of the operation of a semiconductor junction we have
been assuming that the holes and the electrons act more-or-less
independently—except that they somehow get into proper statistical
equilibrium. When we were describing the current produced by light
shining on the junction, we were assuming that an electron or a hole
produced in the junction region would get into the main body of the
crystal before being annihilated by a carrier of the opposite
polarity. In the immediate vicinity of the junction, where the density
of carriers of both signs is approximately equal, the effect of
electron-hole annihilation (or as it is often called,
“recombination”) is an important effect, and in a detailed analysis
of a semiconductor junction must be properly taken into account. We
have been assuming that a hole or an electron produced in a junction
region has a good chance of getting into the main body of the crystal
before recombining. The typical time for an electron or a hole to find
an opposite partner and annihilate it is for typical semiconductor
materials in the range between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-7}$ seconds. This
time is, incidentally, much longer than the mean free time $\tau$
between collisions with scattering sites in the crystal which we used
in the analysis of conductivity. In a typical $n$-$p$ junction, the
time for an electron or hole formed in the junction region to be swept
away into the body of the crystal is generally much shorter than the
recombination time. Most of the pairs will, therefore, contribute to
an external current.</p>

<span class="tag">14–5</span>Rectification at a semiconductor junction</h3>
<div id="Ch14-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We would like to show next how it is that a $p$-$n$ junction can act
like a rectifier. If we put a voltage across the junction, a large
current will flow if the polarity is in one direction, but a very
small current will flow if the same voltage is applied in the opposite
direction. If an alternating voltage is applied across the junction, a
net current will flow in one direction—the current is “rectified.”
Let’s look again at what is going on in the equilibrium condition
described by the graphs of Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F9">14–9</a>. In the $p$-type material there
is a large concentration $N_p$ of positive carriers. These carriers
are diffusing around and a certain number of them each second approach
the junction. This current of positive carriers which approaches the
junction is proportional to $N_p$. Most of them, however, are turned
back by the high potential hill at the junction and only the
fraction $e^{-qV/\kappa T}$ gets through. There is also a current of positive
carriers approaching the junction from the other side. This current is
also proportional to the density of positive carriers in the $n$-type
region, but the carrier density here is much smaller than the density
on the $p$-type side. When the positive carriers approach the junction
from the $n$-type side, they find a hill with a negative slope and
immediately slide downhill to the p-type side of the junction. Let’s
call this current $I_0$. Under equilibrium the currents from the two
directions are equal. We expect then the following relation:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:12}
I_0\propto N_p(\text{$n$-side})=
N_p(\text{$p$-side})e^{-qV/\kappa T}.
\end{equation}

You will notice that this equation is really just the same as
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1410">14.10</a>). We have just derived it in a different way.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch14-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose, however, that we lower the voltage on the $n$-side of the
junction by an amount $\Delta V$—which we can do by applying an
external potential difference to the junction. Now the difference in
potential across the potential hill is no longer $V$ but $V-\Delta
V$. The current of positive carriers from the $p$-side to the $n$-side
will now have this potential difference in its exponential
factor. Calling this current $I_1$, we have
\begin{equation*}
I_1\propto N_p(\text{$p$-side})e^{-q(V-\Delta V)/\kappa T}.
\end{equation*}

This current is larger than $I_0$ by just the factor $e^{q\Delta
V/\kappa T}$. So we have the following relation between $I_1$
and $I_0$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:13}
I_1=I_0e^{+q\Delta V/\kappa T}.
\end{equation}

The current from the $p$-side increases exponentially with the
externally applied voltage $\Delta V$. The current of positive
carriers from the $n$-side, however, remains constant so long
as $\Delta V$ is not too large. When they approach the barrier, these
carriers will still find a downhill potential and will all fall down
to the $p$-side. (If $\Delta V$ is larger than the natural potential
difference $V$, the situation would change, but we will not consider
what happens at such high voltages.) The net current $I$ of positive
carriers which flows across the junction is then the difference
between the currents from the two sides:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:14:14}
I=I_0(e^{+q\Delta V/\kappa T}-1).
\end{equation}

The net current $I$ of holes flows into the $n$-type region. There the
holes diffuse into the body of the $n$-region, where they are
eventually annihilated by the majority $n$-type carriers—the
electrons. The electrons which are lost in this annihilation will be
made up by a current of electrons from the external terminal of the
$n$-type material.</p>

<div id="Ch14-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">When $\Delta V$ is zero, the net current in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1414">14.14</a>)
is zero. For positive $\Delta V$ the current increases rapidly with
the applied voltage. For negative $\Delta V$ the current reverses in
sign, but the exponential term soon becomes negligible and the
negative current never exceeds $I_0$—which under our assumptions is
rather small. This back current $I_0$ is limited by the small density
of the minority $p$-type carriers on the $n$-side of the junction.</p>

current is the sum of the currents contributed by the two carriers,
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1414">14.14</a>) still applies for the total current provided we

close together. Its operation is based in part on the same principles

regions, a $p$-type region, an $n$-type region, and another $p$-type
region, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F11">14–11</a>(a). This combination is
called a $p$-$n$-$p$ transistor. Each of the two junctions in the

junction having a certain potential drop from the $n$-type region to
each $p$-type region. If the two $p$-type regions have the same internal

<p class="p">Let’s first see what happens to the positive carriers, since it is
primarily their behavior which controls the operation of the
$p$-$n$-$p$ transistor. Since the emitter is at a relatively more
positive potential than the base, a current of positive carriers will
flow from the emitter region into the base region. A relatively large
current flows, since we have a junction operating with a “forward
voltage”—corresponding to the right-hand half of the graph in
Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F10">14–10</a>. With these conditions, positive carriers or holes are
being “emitted” from the $p$-type region into the $n$-type
region. You might think that this current would flow out of the
$n$-type region through the base terminal $b$. Now, however, comes the
secret of the transistor. The $n$-type region is made very
thin—typically $10^{-3}$ cm or less, much narrower than its
transverse dimensions. This means that as the holes enter the $n$-type
region they have a very good chance of diffusing across to the other
junction before they are annihilated by the electrons in the $n$-type
region. When they get to the right-hand boundary of the $n$-type
region they find a steep downward potential hill and immediately fall
into the right-hand $p$-type region. This side of the crystal is
called the collector because it “collects” the holes after they have
diffused across the $n$-type region. In a typical transistor, all but
a fraction of a percent of the hole current which leaves the emitter
and enters the base is collected in the collector region, and only the
small remainder contributes to the net base current. The sum of the
base and collector currents is, of course, equal to the emitter
current.</p>

cause a rather large change in the emitter current $I_e$. Since the
collector voltage $V_c$ is much more negative than the base voltage,
these slight variations in potential will not effect appreciably the
steep potential hill between the base and the collector. Most of the
positive carriers emitted into the $n$-region will still be caught by
the collector. Thus as we vary the potential of the base electrode,
there will be a corresponding variation in the collector current $I_c$.
The essential point, however, is that the base current $I_b$
always remains a small fraction of the collector current. The
transistor is an amplifier; a small current $I_b$ introduced into the
base electrode gives a large current—$100$ or so times higher—at
the collector electrode.</p>

<p class="p">What about the electrons—the negative carriers that we have been
neglecting so far? First, note that we do not expect any significant
electron current to flow between the base and the collector. With a
large negative voltage on the collector, the electrons in the base
would have to climb a very high potential energy hill and the
probability of doing that is very small. There is a very small current
of electrons to the collector.</p>

<div id="Ch14-S6-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">On the other hand, the electrons in the base <em class="emph">can</em> go into the
emitter region. In fact, you might expect the electron current in this
direction to be comparable to the hole current from the emitter into
the base. Such an electron current isn’t useful, and, on the contrary,
is bad because it increases the total base current required for a
given current of holes to the collector. The transistor is, therefore,
designed to minimize the electron current to the emitter. The electron
current is proportional to $N_n(\text{base})$, the density of negative
carriers in the base material while the hole current from the emitter
depends on $N_p(\text{emitter})$, the density of positive carriers in
the emitter region. By using relatively little doping in the $n$-type
material $N_n(\text{base})$ can be made much smaller
than $N_p(\text{emitter})$. (The very thin base region also helps a great
deal because the sweeping out of the holes in this region by the
collector increases significantly the average hole current from the
emitter into the base, while leaving the electron current unchanged.)
The net result is that the electron current across the emitter-base
junction can be made much less than the hole current, so that the
electrons do not play any significant role in operation of the
$p$-$n$-$p$ transistor. The currents are dominated by motion of the
holes, and the transistor performs as an amplifier as we have
described above.</p>

<div id="Ch14-S6-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">It is also possible to make a transistor by interchanging the $p$-type
and $n$-type materials in Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F11">14–11</a>. Then we have what is called an
$n$-$p$-$n$ transistor. In the $n$-$p$-$n$ transistor the main
currents are carried by the electrons which flow from the emitter into
the base and from there to the collector. Obviously, all the arguments
we have made for the $p$-$n$-$p$ transistor also apply to the
$n$-$p$-$n$ transistor if the potentials of the electrodes are chosen
with the opposite signs.</p>

  In many books this same energy diagram is
interpreted in a different way. The energy scale refers only to
<em class="emph">electrons</em>. Instead of thinking of the energy of the hole, they
think of the energy an electron <em class="emph">would</em> have if it filled the hole.
This energy is <em class="emph">lower</em> than the free-electron energy—in fact,
just the amount lower that you see in Fig. <a href="#Ch14-F5">14–5</a>. With this
interpretation of the energy scale, the gap energy is the minimum energy
which must be given <em class="emph">to an electron</em> to move it from its bound
state to the conduction band.
