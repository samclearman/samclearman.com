<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">17–1</span>The physics of induction</h3>
<div id="Ch17-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In the last chapter we described many phenomena which show that the
effects of induction are quite complicated and interesting. Now we
want to discuss the fundamental principles which govern these
effects. We have already defined the emf in a conducting circuit as
the total accumulated force on the charges throughout the length of
the loop. More specifically, it is the tangential component of the
force per unit charge, integrated along the wire once around the
circuit. This quantity is equal, therefore, to the total work done on
a single charge that travels once around the circuit.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We have also given the “flux rule,” which says that
the emf is equal to the rate at which the magnetic flux through such a
conducting circuit is changing. Let’s see if we can understand why that
might be. First, we’ll consider a case in which the flux changes because
a circuit is moved in a steady field.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-F1" class="figure">
<img src="img/FLP_II/f17-01/f17-01_tc_big.svgz"><div class="caption">
<span class="tag">Fig. 17–1.</span>An emf is induced in a loop if the flux is changed by varying
the area of the circuit.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">In Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F1">17–1</a> we show a simple loop of wire whose
dimensions can be changed. The loop has two parts, a fixed U-shaped
part (a) and a movable crossbar (b) that can slide along the two legs
of the U. There is always a complete circuit, but its area is
variable. Suppose we now place the loop in a uniform magnetic field
with the plane of the U perpendicular to the field. According to the
rule, when the crossbar is moved there should be in the loop an emf
that is proportional to the rate of change of the flux through the
loop. This emf will cause a current in the loop. We will assume that
there is enough resistance in the wire that the currents are
small. Then we can neglect any magnetic field from this current.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">The flux through the loop is $wLB$, so the “flux rule” would give
for the emf—which we write as $\emf$—
\begin{equation*}
\emf=wB\,\ddt{L}{t}=wBv,
\end{equation*}

where $v$ is the speed of translation of the crossbar.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we should be able to understand this result from the magnetic
$\FLPv\times\FLPB$ forces on the charges in the moving crossbar. These
charges will feel a force, tangential to the wire, equal to $vB$ per
unit charge. It is constant along the length $w$ of the crossbar and
zero elsewhere, so the integral is
\begin{equation*}
\emf=wvB,
\end{equation*}

which is the same result we got from the rate of change of the flux.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">The argument just given can be extended to any case where there is a
fixed magnetic field and the wires are moved. One can prove, in
general, that for any circuit whose parts move in a fixed magnetic
field the emf is the time derivative of the flux, regardless of the
shape of the circuit.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">On the other hand, what happens if the loop is stationary and the
magnetic field is changed? We cannot deduce the answer to this
question from the same argument. It was
Faraday’s discovery—from
experiment—that the “flux rule” is still correct no matter why the
flux changes. The force on electric charges is given in complete
generality by $\FLPF=q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB)$; there are no new
special “forces due to changing magnetic fields.” Any forces on
charges at rest in a stationary wire come from the
$\FLPE$ term. Faraday’s
observations led to the discovery that electric and
magnetic fields are related by a new law: in a region where the
magnetic field is changing with time, electric fields are
generated. It is this electric field which drives the electrons around
the wire—and so is responsible for the emf in a stationary circuit
when there is a changing magnetic flux.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">The general law for the electric field associated with a changing
magnetic field is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:1}
\FLPcurl{\FLPE}=-\ddp{\FLPB}{t}.
\end{equation}

We will call this Faraday’s law. It was discovered
by Faraday but was first
written in differential form by Maxwell, as one of his equations. Let’s see how this equation gives
the “flux rule” for circuits.

If we imagine the “circuit” to be completed through the plates

<div id="Ch17-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">As an example of the effect of such an induced electric field, we want
now to consider the motion of an electron in a changing magnetic
field. We imagine a magnetic field which, everywhere on a plane,
points in a vertical direction, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F4">17–4</a>. The
magnetic field is produced by an electromagnet, but we will not worry
about the details. For our example we will imagine that the magnetic
field is symmetric about some axis, i.e., that the strength of the
magnetic field will depend only on the distance from the axis. The
magnetic field is also varying with time. We now imagine an electron
that is moving in this field on a path that is a circle of constant
radius with its center at the axis of the field. (We will see later how
this motion can be arranged.) Because of the changing magnetic field,
there will be an electric field $\FLPE$ tangential to the electron’s
orbit which will drive it around the circle. Because of the symmetry,
this electric field will have the same value everywhere on the circle.
If the electron’s orbit has the radius $r$, the line integral of $\FLPE$
around the orbit is equal to minus the rate of change of the magnetic flux
through the circle. The line integral of $\FLPE$ is just its magnitude
times the circumference of the circle, $2\pi r$. The magnetic flux must,
in general, be obtained from an integral. For the moment, we let
$B_{\text{av}}$ represent the average magnetic field in the interior of
the circle; then the flux is this average magnetic field times the area
of the circle. We will have
\begin{equation*}
2\pi rE=\ddt{}{t}(B_{\text{av}}\cdot\pi r^2).
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S3-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Since we are assuming $r$ is constant, $E$ is proportional to the time
derivative of the average field:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:4}
E=\frac{r}{2}\,\ddt{B_{\text{av}}}{t}.
\end{equation}

The electron will feel the electric force $q\FLPE$ and will be
accelerated by it. Remembering that the relativistically correct
equation of motion is that the rate of change of the momentum is
proportional to the force, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:5}
qE=\ddt{p}{t}.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S3-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">For the circular orbit we have assumed, the electric force on the electron is
always in the direction of its motion, so its total momentum will be increasing
at the rate given by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII175">17.5</a>). Combining Eqs.
(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII175">17.5</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII174">17.4</a>), we may relate the rate of change of
momentum to the change of the average magnetic field:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:6}
\ddt{p}{t}=\frac{qr}{2}\,\ddt{B_{\text{av}}}{t}.
\end{equation}

Integrating with respect to $t$, we find for the electron’s momentum
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:7}
p=p_0+\frac{qr}{2}\,\Delta B_{\text{av}},
\end{equation}

where $p_0$ is the momentum with which the electrons start out, and
$\Delta B_{\text{av}}$, is the subsequent change in $B_{\text{av}}$.
The operation of a
<em class="emph">betatron</em>—a machine for accelerating electrons
to high energies—is based on this idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">To see how the betatron operates in detail, we must
now examine how the electron can be constrained to move on a
circle. We have discussed in Chapter <a href="I_11.html">11</a> of Vol. I the
principle involved. If we arrange that there is a magnetic field $\FLPB$
at the orbit of the electron, there will be a transverse
force $q\FLPv\times\FLPB$ which, for a suitably chosen $\FLPB$, can cause
the electron to keep moving on its assumed orbit. In the
betatron this transverse force causes the electron to
move in a circular orbit of constant radius. We can find out what the
magnetic field at the orbit must be by using again the relativistic
equation of motion, but this time, for the transverse component of the
force. In the betatron (see Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F4">17–4</a>),
$\FLPB$ is at right angles to $\FLPv$, so the transverse force is $qvB$.
Thus the force is equal to the rate of change of the transverse
component $p_t$ of the momentum:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:8}
qvB=\ddt{p_t}{t}.
\end{equation}
When a particle is moving in a <em class="emph">circle</em>, the rate of change of
its transverse momentum is equal to the magnitude of the total
momentum times $\omega$, the angular velocity of rotation (following
the arguments of Chapter <a href="I_11.html">11</a>, Vol. I):
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:9}
\ddt{p_t}{t}=\omega p,
\end{equation}
where, since the motion is circular,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:10}
\omega=\frac{v}{r}.
\end{equation}
Setting the magnetic force equal to the transverse acceleration, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:11}
qvB_{\text{orbit}}=p\,\frac{v}{r},
\end{equation}
where $B_{\text{orbit}}$ is the field at the radius $r$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">
As the betatron operates, the momentum of the electron
grows in proportion to $B_{\text{av}}$, according to
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII177">17.7</a>), and if the electron is to continue to move in
its proper circle, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1711">17.11</a>) must continue to hold as the
momentum of the electron increases. The value of $B_{\text{orbit}}$ must
increase in proportion to the momentum $p$. Comparing
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1711">17.11</a>) with Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII177">17.7</a>), which determines
$p$, we see that the following relation must hold between
$B_{\text{av}}$, the average magnetic field <em class="emph">inside</em> the orbit at
the radius $r$, and the magnetic field $B_{\text{orbit}}$ at the orbit:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:12}
\Delta B_{\text{av}}=2\,\Delta B_{\text{orbit}}.
\end{equation}
The correct operation of a betatron requires that the
average magnetic field inside the orbit increases at twice the rate of
the magnetic field at the orbit itself. In these circumstances, as the
energy of the particle is increased by the induced electric field the
magnetic field at the orbit increases at just the rate required to
keep the particle moving in a circle.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S3-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">
The betatron is used to accelerate electrons to
energies of tens of millions of volts, or even to hundreds of millions
of volts. However, it becomes impractical for the acceleration of
electrons to energies much higher than a few hundred million volts for
several reasons. One of them is the practical difficulty of attaining
the required high average value for the magnetic field inside the
orbit. Another is that Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII176">17.6</a>) is no longer correct
at very high energies because it does not include the loss of energy
from the particle due to its radiation of electromagnetic energy (the
so-called synchrotron radiation\index{Synchrotron radiation} discussed
in Chapter <a href="I_36.html">36</a>, Vol. I). For these reasons, the
acceleration of electrons to the highest energies&mdash;to many billions
of electron volts&mdash;is accomplished by means of a different kind of
machine, called a <em class="emph">synchrotron</em>.</p>

in physics there are never any real paradoxes because there is only

</div>
<div id="Ch17-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Imagine that we construct a device like that shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F5">17–5</a>. There is a thin, circular plastic disc supported
on a concentric shaft with excellent bearings, so that it is quite free
to rotate. On the disc is a coil of wire in the form of a short solenoid
concentric with the axis of rotation. This solenoid carries a steady
current $I$ provided by a small battery, also mounted on the disc. Near
the edge of the disc and spaced uniformly around its circumference are a
number of small metal spheres insulated from each other and from the
solenoid by the plastic material of the disc. Each of these small
conducting spheres is charged with the same electrostatic charge $Q$.
Everything is quite stationary, and the disc is at rest. Suppose now
that by some accident—or by prearrangement—the current in the
solenoid is interrupted, without, however, any intervention from the
outside. So long as the current continued, there was a magnetic flux
through the solenoid more or less parallel to the axis of the disc. When
the current is interrupted, this flux must go to zero. There will,
therefore, be an electric field induced which will circulate around in
circles centered at the axis. The charged spheres on the perimeter of
the disc will all experience an electric field tangential to the
perimeter of the disc. This electric force is in the same sense for all
the charges and so will result in a net torque on the disc. From these
arguments we would expect that as the current in the solenoid
disappears, the disc would begin to rotate. If we knew the moment of
inertia of the disc, the current in the solenoid, and the charges on the
small spheres, we could compute the resulting angular velocity.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">But we could also make a different argument. Using the principle of
the conservation of angular momentum, we could say that the angular
momentum of the disc with all its equipment is initially zero, and so
the angular momentum of the assembly should remain zero. There should
be no rotation when the current is stopped. Which argument is correct?
Will the disc rotate or will it not? We will leave this question for
you to think about.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We should warn you that the correct answer does not depend on any
nonessential feature, such as the asymmetric position of a battery,
for example. In fact, you can imagine an ideal situation such as the
following: The solenoid is made of superconducting wire through which
there is a current. After the disc has been carefully placed at rest,
the temperature of the solenoid is allowed to rise slowly When the
temperature of the wire reaches the transition temperature between
superconductivity and normal conductivity, the current in the solenoid
will be brought to zero by the resistance of the wire. The flux will,
as before, fall to zero, and there will be an electric field around
the axis. We should also warn you that the solution is not easy, nor
is it a trick. When you figure it out, you will have discovered an
important principle of electromagnetism.</p>

of a coil of wire rotating in a uniform magnetic field. The same result

rotates in the manner described in the last chapter. We will consider
only the former case. Suppose we have a circular coil of wire which can
be turned on an axis along one of its diameters. Let this coil be
located in a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the axis of

current being drawn from the generator, the potential difference $V$
between the two wires will be equal to the emf in the rotating
coil. That is,
\begin{equation*}
V=NBS\omega\sin\omega t=V_0\sin\omega t.

The potential difference between the wires varies as $\sin\omega

<p class="p">Since there is an electric field between the wires, they must be
electrically charged. It is clear that the emf of the generator has
pushed some excess charges out to the wire until the electric field
from them is strong enough to exactly counterbalance the induction
force. Seen from outside the generator, the two wires appear as though
they had been electrostatically charged to the potential difference $V$,
and as though the charge was being changed with time to give an
alternating potential difference. There is also another difference
from an electrostatic situation. If we connect the generator to an
external circuit that permits passage of a current, we find that the
emf does not permit the wires to be discharged but continues to
provide charge to the wires as current is drawn from them, attempting
to keep the wires always at the same potential difference. If, in
fact, the generator is connected in a circuit whose total resistance
is $R$, the current through the circuit will be proportional to the
emf of the generator and inversely proportional to $R$. Since the emf
has a sinusoidal time variation, so also does the current. There is an
alternating current
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{\emf}{R}=\frac{V_0}{R}\sin\omega t.

the generator. Each charge in the wire is receiving energy at the
rate $\FLPF\cdot\FLPv$, where $\FLPF$ is the force on the charge and
$\FLPv$ is its velocity. Now let the number of moving charges per unit
length of the wire be $n$; then the power being delivered into any
element $ds$ of the wire is
\begin{equation*}
\FLPF\cdot\FLPv n\,ds.

For a wire, $\FLPv$ is always along $d\FLPs$, so we can rewrite the
power as
\begin{equation*}
nv\FLPF\cdot d\FLPs.

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:17}
\tau=NISB\sin\theta.
\end{equation}

The rate at which mechanical work must be done to keep the coil
rotating is the angular velocity $\omega$ times the torque:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:18}
\ddt{W}{t}=\omega\tau=\omega NISB\sin\theta.
\end{equation}

Comparing this equation with Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1714">17.14</a>), we see that
the rate of mechanical work required to rotate the coil against the
magnetic forces is just equal to $\emf I$, the rate at which
electrical energy is delivered by the emf of the generator. All of the
mechanical energy used up in the generator appears as electrical
energy in the circuit.</p>

<div id="Ch17-S5-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">As another example of the currents and forces due to an induced emf,
let’s analyze what happens in the setup described in
Section <a href="#Ch17-S1">17–1</a>, and shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F1">17–1</a>. There
are two parallel wires and a sliding crossbar located in a uniform
magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the parallel wires. Now
let’s assume that the “bottom” of the U (the left side in the figure)
is made of wires of high resistance, while the two side wires are made
of a good conductor like copper—then we don’t need to worry about the
change of the circuit resistance as the crossbar is moved. As before,
the emf in the circuit is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:19}
\emf=vBw.
\end{equation}

The current in the circuit is proportional to this emf and inversely
proportional to the resistance of the circuit:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:20}
I=\frac{\emf}{R}=\frac{vBw}{R}.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S5-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Because of this current there will be a magnetic force on the crossbar
that is proportional to its length, to the current in it, and to the
magnetic field, such that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:21}
F=BIw.
\end{equation}

Taking $I$ from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1720">17.20</a>), we have for the force
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:22}
F=\frac{B^2w^2}{R}\,v.
\end{equation}

We see that the force is proportional to the velocity of the
crossbar. The direction of the force, as you can easily see, is
opposite to its velocity. Such a “velocity-proportional” force,
which is like the force of viscosity, is found whenever induced
currents are produced by moving conductors in a magnetic field. The
examples of eddy currents we gave in the last chapter also produced
forces on the conductors proportional to the velocity of the
conductor, even though such situations, in general, give a complicated
distribution of currents which is difficult to analyze.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S5-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">It is often convenient in the design of mechanical systems to have
damping forces which are proportional to the velocity. Eddy-current
forces provide one of the most convenient ways of getting such a
velocity-dependent force. An example of the application of such a
force is found in the conventional domestic wattmeter. In the
wattmeter there is a thin aluminum disc that rotates between the poles
of a permanent magnet. This disc is driven by a small electric motor
whose torque is proportional to the power being consumed in the
electrical circuit of the house. Because of the eddy-current forces in
the disc, there is a resistive force proportional to the velocity. In
equilibrium, the velocity is therefore proportional to the rate of
consumption of electrical energy. By means of a counter attached to
the rotating disc, a record is kept of the number of revolutions it
makes. This count is an indication of the total energy consumption,
i.e., the number of watthours used.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S5-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">We may also point out that Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1722">17.22</a>) shows that the
force from induced currents—that is, any eddy-current force—is
inversely proportional to the resistance. The force will be larger,
the better the conductivity of the material. The reason, of course, is
that an emf produces more current if the resistance is low, and the
stronger currents represent greater mechanical forces.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S5-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">We can also see from our formulas how mechanical energy is converted
into electrical energy. As before, the electrical energy supplied to
the resistance of the circuit is the product $\emf I$. The rate at
which work is done in moving the conducting crossbar is the force on
the bar times its velocity. Using Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1721">17.21</a>) for the
force, the rate of doing work is
\begin{equation*}
\ddt{W}{t}=\frac{v^2B^2w^2}{R}.

We see that this is indeed equal to the product $\emf I$ we would get from
Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1719">17.19</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1720">17.20</a>). Again the mechanical

<p class="p">Suppose that we wish to find the mutual inductance between any two
arbitrary coils—for example, those shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F9">17–9</a>. We

as
\begin{equation*}
\emf_1=-\ddt{}{t}\int_{(1)}\FLPB\cdot\FLPn\,da,

where $\FLPB$ is the magnetic field and the integral is to be taken
over a surface bounded by circuit $1$. We have seen in
Section <a href="II_14.html#Ch14-S1">14–1</a> that such a surface integral of $\FLPB$ can
be related to a line integral of the vector potential. In particular,
\begin{equation*}

<div id="Ch17-S6-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let’s assume that the vector potential at circuit $1$ comes from
currents in circuit $2$. Then it can be written as a line integral
around circuit $2$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:29}
\FLPA=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO c^2}\oint_{(2)}\frac{I_2\,d\FLPs_2}{r_{12}},

where $I_2$ is the current in circuit $2$, and $r_{12}$ is the distance from the
element of the circuit $d\FLPs_2$ to the point on circuit $1$ at which we are
evaluating the vector potential. (See Fig. <a href="#Ch17-F9">17–9</a>.) Combining
Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1728">17.28</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1729">17.29</a>), we can express the emf

\begin{equation*}
\emf_1=-\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO c^2}\,\ddt{}{t}\oint_{(1)}\oint_{(2)}
\frac{I_2\,d\FLPs_2}{r_{12}}\cdot d\FLPs_1.
\end{equation*}

In this equation the integrals are all taken with respect to
stationary circuits. The only variable quantity is the current $I_2$,
which does not depend on the variables of integration. We may
therefore take it out of the integrals. The emf can then be written as
\begin{equation*}
\emf_1=\mutualInd_{12}\,\ddt{I_2}{t},

where the coefficient $\mutualInd_{12}$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:30}
\mutualInd_{12}=-\frac{1}{4\pi\epsO c^2}\oint_{(1)}\oint_{(2)}
\frac{d\FLPs_2\cdot d\FLPs_1}{r_{12}}.
\end{equation}

We see from this integral that $\mutualInd_{12}$ depends only on the
circuit geometry. It depends on a kind of average separation of the
two circuits, with the average weighted most for parallel segments of
the two coils. Our equation can be used for calculating the mutual
inductance of any two circuits of arbitrary shape. Also, it shows that
the integral for $\mutualInd_{12}$ is identical to the integral
for $\mutualInd_{21}$. We have therefore shown that the two coefficients are
identical. For a system with only two coils, the coefficients
$\mutualInd_{12}$ and $\mutualInd_{21}$ are often represented by the
symbol $\mutualInd$ without subscripts, called simply the <em class="emph">mutual

\begin{equation*}
\mutualInd_{12}=\mutualInd_{21}=\mutualInd.

of the two fluxes which would exist separately, because the law of superposition
applies for magnetic fields. The emf in either coil will therefore be

to the change in the current of the coil itself. Thus the total emf in coil $2$

that corresponding to the mechanical momentum $p=mv$, whose rate of

equal to $\selfInd I$, whose rate of change is $\voltage$. We have no right,
of course, to say that $\selfInd I$ is the real momentum of the circuit;
in fact, it isn’t. The whole circuit may be standing still and have no
momentum. It is only that $\selfInd I$ is analogous to the momentum $mv$
in the sense of satisfying corresponding equations. In the same way,
to the kinetic energy $\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2$, there corresponds an
analogous quantity $\tfrac{1}{2}\selfInd I^2$. But there we have a
surprise. This $\tfrac{1}{2}\selfInd I^2$ is really the energy in the
electrical case also. This is because the rate of doing work on the
inductance is $\voltage I$, and in the mechanical system it is $Fv$, the
corresponding quantity. Therefore, in the case of the energy, the
quantities not only correspond mathematically, but also have the same
physical meaning as well.</p>

<div id="Ch17-S8-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We may see this in more detail as follows. As we found in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1716">17.16</a>), the rate of electrical work by induced forces
is the product of the electromotive force and the current:
\begin{equation*}
\ddt{W}{t}=\emf I.
\end{equation*}

Replacing $\emf$ by its expression in terms of the current from
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1734">17.34</a>), we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:36}
\ddt{W}{t}=-\selfInd I\,\ddt{I}{t}.
\end{equation}

Integrating this equation, we find that the energy required from an
external source to overcome the emf in the self-inductance while
building up the current<a name="footnote_source_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup class="mark">4</sup></a> (which must equal the energy stored,
$U$) is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:37}
-W=U=\tfrac{1}{2}\selfInd I^2.

U=\tfrac{1}{2}\selfInd_1I_1^2+\tfrac{1}{2}\selfInd_2I_2^2+\mutualInd I_1I_2.

For, starting with $I=0$ in both coils, we could first turn on the

just $\tfrac{1}{2}\selfInd_1I_1^2$. But now, on turning up $I_2$, we not
only do the work $\tfrac{1}{2}\selfInd_2I_2^2$ against the emf in
circuit $2$, but also an additional amount $\mutualInd I_1I_2$, which
is the integral of the emf [$\mutualInd(dI_2/dt)$] in circuit $1$

change the relative positions of the coils the only quantity which
varies is the mutual inductance $\mutualInd$. We might then write the
equation of virtual work as
\begin{equation*}
-F\,\Delta x=\Delta U=I_1I_2\,\Delta\mutualInd\quad(\text{wrong}).
\end{equation*}

But this equation is wrong because, as we have seen earlier, it
includes only the change in the energy of the two coils and not the
change in the energy of the sources which are maintaining the currents
$I_1$ and $I_2$ at their constant values. We can now understand that
these sources must supply energy against the induced emf’s in the
coils as they are moved. If we wish to apply the principle of virtual
work correctly, we must also include these energies. As we have seen,
however, we may take a short cut and use the principle of virtual work
by remembering that the total energy is the negative of what we have
called $U_{\text{mech}}$, the “mechanical energy.” We can therefore
write for the force
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:39}

<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:40}
U=\frac{1}{2}\,\selfInd_1\biggl(I_1+\frac{\mutualInd}{\selfInd_1}\,I_2\biggr)^2+
\frac{1}{2}\biggl(\selfInd_2-\frac{\mutualInd^2}{\selfInd_1}\biggr)I_2^2.
\end{equation}
</span>
<span class="eq-narrow">

\begin{align}
U=\;\;\frac{1}{2}\,\selfInd_1&\biggl(I_1+\frac{\mutualInd}{\selfInd_1}\,I_2\biggr)^2\notag\\[.75ex]
\label{Eq:II:17:40}
+\;\frac{1}{2}&\biggl(\selfInd_2-\frac{\mutualInd^2}{\selfInd_1}\biggr)I_2^2.
\end{align}

</span>


That is just an algebraic transformation. This quantity must always be
positive for any values of $I_1$ and $I_2$. In particular, it must be
positive if $I_2$ should happen to have the special value
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:41}
I_2=-\frac{\selfInd_1}{\mutualInd}\,I_1.
\end{equation}

But with this current for $I_2$, the first term in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1740">17.40</a>) is zero. If the energy is to be positive, the
last term in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1740">17.40</a>) must be greater than zero. We have the
requirement that
\begin{equation*}
\selfInd_1\selfInd_2&gt;\mutualInd^2.
\end{equation*}

We have thus proved the general result that the magnitude of the
mutual inductance $\mutualInd$ of any two coils is necessarily less than or
equal to the geometric mean of the two self-inductances. ($\mutualInd$
itself may be positive or negative, depending on the sign conventions
for the currents $I_1$ and $I_2$.)
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:42}
\abs{\mutualInd}&lt;\sqrt{\selfInd_1\selfInd_2}.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S8-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">The relation between $\mutualInd$ and the self-inductances is usually
written as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:43}
\mutualInd=k\sqrt{\selfInd_1\selfInd_2}.
\end{equation}

The constant $k$ is called the coefficient of
coupling.
If most of the flux from one coil links the other coil, the coefficient
of coupling is near one; we say the coils are “tightly coupled.” If
the coils are far apart or otherwise arranged so that there is very
little mutual flux linkage, the coefficient of coupling is near zero and
the mutual inductance is very small.</p>

<div id="Ch17-S8-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">For calculating the mutual inductance of two coils, we have given in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1730">17.30</a>) a formula which is a double line integral
around the two circuits. We might think that the same formula could be
used to get the self-inductance of a single coil by carrying out both
line integrals around the same coil. This, however, will not work, because
the denominator $r_{12}$ of the integrand will go to zero when the two
line elements $d\FLPs_1$ and $d\FLPs_2$ are at the same point on the
coil.  The self-inductance obtained from this formula is
infinite. The reason is that this formula is an approximation that is
valid only when the cross sections of the wires of the two circuits
are small compared with the distance from one circuit to the
other. Clearly, this approximation doesn’t hold for a single coil. It
is, in fact, true that the inductance of a single coil tends
logarithmically to infinity as the diameter of its wire is made
smaller and smaller.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S8-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">We must, then, look for a different way of calculating the
self-inductance of a single coil. It is necessary to take into account
the distribution of the currents within the wires because the size of
the wire is an important parameter. We should therefore ask not what
is the inductance of a “circuit,” but what is the inductance of a
<em class="emph">distribution</em> of conductors. Perhaps the easiest way to find
this inductance is to make use of the magnetic energy. We found
earlier, in Section <a href="II_15.html#Ch15-S3">15–3</a>, an expression for the magnetic
energy of a distribution of stationary currents:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:44}
U=\tfrac{1}{2}\int\FLPj\cdot\FLPA\,dV.
\end{equation}

If we know the distribution of current density $\FLPj$, we can compute
the vector potential $\FLPA$ and then evaluate the integral of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1744">17.44</a>) to get the energy. This energy is equal to the
magnetic energy of the self-inductance, $\tfrac{1}{2}\selfInd I^2$.
Equating the two gives us a formula for the inductance:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:45}
\selfInd=\frac{1}{I^2}\int\FLPj\cdot\FLPA\,dV.
\end{equation}

We expect, of course, that the inductance is a number depending only
on the geometry of the circuit and not on the current $I$ in the
circuit. The formula of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1745">17.45</a>) will indeed give
such a result, because the integral in this equation is proportional
to the square of the current—the current appears once
through $\FLPj$ and again through the vector potential $\FLPA$. The integral
divided by $I^2$ will depend on the geometry of the circuit but not on
the current $I$.</p>

<div id="Ch17-S8-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1744">17.44</a>) for the energy of a current distribution
can be put in a quite different form which is sometimes more
convenient for calculation. Also, as we will see later, it is a form
that is important because it is more generally valid. In the energy
equation, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1744">17.44</a>), both $\FLPA$ and $\FLPj$ can be
related to $\FLPB$, so we can hope to express the energy in terms of
the magnetic field—just as we were able to relate the electrostatic
energy to the electric field. We begin by replacing $\FLPj$ by $\epsO
c^2\FLPcurl{\FLPB}$. We cannot replace $\FLPA$ so easily, since
$\FLPB=\FLPcurl{\FLPA}$ cannot be reversed to give $\FLPA$ in terms
of $\FLPB$. Anyway, we can write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:46}
U=\frac{\epsO c^2}{2}\int(\FLPcurl{\FLPB})\cdot\FLPA\,dV.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch17-S8-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">The interesting thing is that—with some restrictions—this integral
can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:17:47}
U=\frac{\epsO c^2}{2}\int\FLPB\cdot(\FLPcurl{\FLPA})\,dV.
\end{equation}

To see this, we write out in detail a typical term. Suppose that we
take the term $(\FLPcurl{\FLPB})_zA_z$ which occurs in the integral of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1746">17.46</a>). Writing out the components, we get
\begin{equation*}
\int\biggl(\ddp{B_y}{x}-\ddp{B_x}{y}\biggr)A_z\,dx\,dy\,dz.
\end{equation*}

(There are, of course, two more integrals of the same kind.) We now
integrate the first term with respect to $x$—integrating by
parts. That is, we can say
\begin{equation*}
\int\ddp{B_y}{x}\,A_z\,dx=B_yA_z-\int B_y\,\ddp{A_z}{x}\,dx.
\end{equation*}

Now suppose that our system—meaning the sources and fields—is
finite, so that as we go to large distances all fields go to
zero. Then if the integrals are carried out over all space, evaluating
the term $B_yA_z$ at the limits will give zero. We have left only the
term with $B_y(\ddpl{A_z}{x})$, which is evidently one part
of $B_y(\FLPcurl{\FLPA})_y$ and, therefore,
of $\FLPB\cdot(\FLPcurl{\FLPA})$. If you work out the other five terms,
you will see that Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1747">17.47</a>) is indeed equivalent to
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1746">17.46</a>).</p>

\end{equation}

We have expressed the energy of a magnetostatic situation in terms of
the magnetic field only. The expression corresponds closely to the
formula we found for the electrostatic energy:

U=\frac{\epsO}{2}\int\FLPE\cdot\FLPE\,dV.

<p class="p">One reason for emphasizing these two energy formulas is that sometimes
they are more convenient to use. More important, it turns out that for

<p class="p">If we know the magnetic field $\FLPB$ of a single coil, we can find
the self-inductance by equating the energy
expression (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1748">17.48</a>) to $\tfrac{1}{2}\selfInd I^2$. Let’s see
how this works by finding the self-inductance of a long solenoid. We
have seen earlier that the magnetic field inside a solenoid is uniform
and $\FLPB$ outside is zero. The magnitude of the field inside is
$B=nI/\epsO c^2$, where $n$ is the number of turns per unit length in
the winding and $I$ is the current. If the radius of the coil is $r$ and
its length is $L$ (we take $L$ very long, so that we can neglect end
effects, i.e., $L\gg r$), the volume inside is $\pi r^2L$. The magnetic
energy is therefore
\begin{equation*}
U=\frac{\epsO c^2}{2}\,B^2\cdot(\text{Vol})=\frac{n^2I^2}{2\epsO c^2}\,
\pi r^2L,
\end{equation*}

which is equal to $\tfrac{1}{2}\selfInd I^2$. Or,
\begin{equation}
