<p class="p">“When I was in high school, my physics teacher—whose name
was Mr.&nbsp;Bader—called me down one day after physics class and said,
‘You look bored; I want to tell you something interesting.’ Then he told
me something which I found absolutely fascinating, and have, since then,
always found fascinating. Every time the subject comes up, I work on it.
In fact, when I began to prepare this lecture I found myself making more
analyses on the thing. Instead of worrying about the lecture, I got
involved in a new problem. The subject is this—the principle of least
action.

<p class="p">“Mr.&nbsp;Bader told me the following: Suppose you have a particle (in a
gravitational field, for instance) which starts somewhere and moves to
some other point by free motion—you throw it, and it goes up and comes
down (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch19-F1">19–1</a>). It goes from the original place to the
final place in a certain amount of time. Now, you try a different
motion. Suppose that to get from here to there, it went as shown in

height above the ground, the kinetic energy
is&nbsp;$\tfrac{1}{2}m\,(dx/dt)^2$, and the potential energy at any time
is&nbsp;$mgx$. Now I take the kinetic energy minus the potential energy at
every moment along the path and integrate that with respect to time from
the initial time to the final time. Let’s suppose that at the original

for which there is no potential energy at all. Then the rule says that
in going from one point to another in a given amount of time, the
kinetic energy integral is least, so it must go at a uniform
speed. (We know that’s the right answer—to go at a uniform speed.)
Why is that? Because if the particle were to go any other way, the
velocities would be sometimes higher and sometimes lower than the
average. The average velocity is the same for every case because it
has to get from ‘here’ to ‘there’ in a given amount of time.

You can accelerate like mad at the beginning and slow down with the
brakes near the end, or you can go at a uniform speed, or you can go
backwards for a while and then go forward, and so on. The thing is
that the average speed has got to be, of course, the total distance
that you have gone over the time. But if you do anything but go at a
uniform speed, then sometimes you are going too fast and sometimes you
are going too slow. Now the mean <em class="emph">square</em> of something that
deviates around an average, as you know, is always greater than the
square of the mean; so the kinetic energy integral would always be
higher if you wobbled your velocity than if you went at a uniform

a constant (when there are no forces). The correct path is shown in

But wait. I’m not worrying about higher than the first order, so I
will take all the terms which involve $\eta^2$ and higher powers and
put them in a little box called ‘second and higher order.’ From this

ordinary nature of derivatives) the correction is $\eta$&nbsp;times the
rate of change of&nbsp;$V$ with respect to&nbsp;$x$, and so on:

V(\underline{x}+\eta)=V(\underline{x})+
\eta V'(\underline{x})+\frac{\eta^2}{2}\,V''(\underline{x})+\dotsb

I have written $V'$ for the derivative of&nbsp;$V$ with respect to&nbsp;$x$ in

if&nbsp;$\eta$ can be anything at all, its derivative is anything also, so you

mean by ‘least’ is that the first-order change in the value of&nbsp;$S$,
when you change the path, is zero. It is not necessarily a ‘minimum.’

</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p37" class="para">
<p class="p">“Next, I remark on some generalizations. In the first place, the thing
can be done in three dimensions. Instead of just&nbsp;$x$, I would have
$x$,&nbsp;$y$, and&nbsp;$z$ as functions of&nbsp;$t$; the action is more complicated.
For three-dimensional motion, you have to use the complete kinetic
energy—$(m/2)$&nbsp;times the whole velocity squared. That is,
\begin{equation*}
\text{KE}=\frac{m}{2}\biggl[
\biggl(\ddt{x}{t}\biggr)^2\!\!+\biggl(\ddt{y}{t}\biggr)^2\!\!+
\biggl(\ddt{z}{t}\biggr)^2\,\biggr].
\end{equation*}
Also, the potential energy is a function of $x$,&nbsp;$y$, and&nbsp;$z$. And
what about the path? The path is some general curve in space, which is
not so easily drawn, but the idea is the same. And what about
the&nbsp;$\eta$?  Well, $\eta$ can have three components. You could shift the
paths in&nbsp;$x$, or in&nbsp;$y$, or in&nbsp;$z$—or you could shift in all three
directions simultaneously. So $\eta$ would be a vector. This doesn’t
really complicate things too much, though. Since only the
<em class="emph">first-order</em> variation has to be zero, we can do the calculation
by three successive shifts. We can shift&nbsp;$\eta$ only in the
$x$-direction and say that coefficient must be zero. We get one
equation. Then we shift it in the $y$-direction and get another. And
in the $z$-direction and get another. Or, of course, in any order that
you want. Anyway, you get three equations. And, of course, Newton’s
law is really three equations in the three dimensions—one for each
component. I think that you can practically see that it is bound to
work, but we will leave you to show for yourself that it will work for
three dimensions. Incidentally, you could use any coordinate system
you want, polar or otherwise, and get Newton’s laws appropriate to
that system right off by seeing what happens if you have the
shift&nbsp;$\eta$ in radius, or in angle, etc.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p38" class="para">
<p class="p">“Similarly, the method can be generalized to any number of particles.
If you have, say, two particles with a force between them, so that there
is a mutual potential energy, then you just add the kinetic energy of
both particles and take the potential energy of the mutual interaction.
And what do you vary? You vary the paths of <em class="emph">both</em> particles. Then,
for two particles moving in three dimensions, there are six equations.
You can vary the position of particle&nbsp;$1$ in the $x$-direction, in the
$y$-direction, and in the $z$-direction, and similarly for particle&nbsp;$2$;
so there are six equations. And that’s as it should be. There are the
three equations that determine the acceleration of particle&nbsp;$1$ in terms
of the force on it and three for the acceleration of particle&nbsp;$2$, from
the force on it. You follow the same game through, and you get Newton’s
law in three dimensions for any number of particles.

</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p39" class="para">
<p class="p">“I have been saying that we get Newton’s law. That is not quite true,
because Newton’s law includes nonconservative forces like friction.
Newton said that&nbsp;$ma$ is equal to
any&nbsp;$F$. But the principle of least action only works for
<em class="emph">conservative</em> systems—where all forces can be gotten from a
potential function. You know, however, that on a microscopic level—on
the deepest level of physics—there are no nonconservative forces.
Nonconservative forces, like friction, appear only because we neglect
microscopic complications—there are just too many particles to
analyze. But the <em class="emph">fundamental</em> laws <em class="emph">can</em> be put in the form
of a principle of least action.

</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p40" class="para">
<p class="p">“Let me generalize still further. Suppose we ask what happens if the
particle moves relativistically. We did not get the right relativistic
equation of motion; $F=ma$ is only right nonrelativistically. The
question is: Is there a corresponding principle of least action for
the relativistic case? There is. The formula in the case of relativity
is the following:
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation*}
S=-m_0c^2\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}\,dt-
q\int_{t_1}^{t_2}[\phi(x,y,z,t)-\FLPv\cdot
\FLPA(x,y,z,t)]\,dt.

S=-m_0c^2&\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}\,dt\\[1.25ex]
-q&\int_{t_1}^{t_2}[\phi(x,y,z,t)-\FLPv\cdot
\FLPA(x,y,z,t)]\,dt.
\end{align*}

</span>
The first part of the action integral is the rest mass&nbsp;$m_0$
times&nbsp;$c^2$ times the integral of a function of velocity,
$\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$. Then instead of just the potential energy, we have
an integral over the scalar potential&nbsp;$\phi$ and over $\FLPv$ times
the vector potential&nbsp;$\FLPA$. Of course, we are then including only
electromagnetic forces. All electric and magnetic fields are given in
terms of $\phi$ and&nbsp;$\FLPA$. This action function gives the complete
theory of relativistic motion of a single particle in an
electromagnetic field.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p41" class="para">
<p class="p">“Of course, wherever I have written $\FLPv$, you understand that
before you try to figure anything out, you must substitute $dx/dt$
for&nbsp;$v_x$ and so on for the other components. Also, you put the point
along the path at time&nbsp;$t$, $x(t)$, $y(t)$, $z(t)$ where I wrote
simply $x$, $y$, $z$. Properly, it is only after you have made those
replacements for the&nbsp;$\FLPv$’s that you have the formula for the
action for a relativistic particle. I will leave to the more ingenious
of you the problem to demonstrate that this action formula does, in
fact, give the correct equations of motion for relativity. May I
suggest you do it first without the&nbsp;$\FLPA$, that is, for no magnetic
field?  Then you should get the components of the equation of motion,
$d\FLPp/dt=-q\,\FLPgrad{\phi}$, where, you remember,
$\FLPp=m_0\FLPv/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$.

<div id="Ch19-S1-p42" class="para">
<p class="p">“It is much more difficult to include also the case with a vector
potential. The variations get much more complicated. But in the end,
the force term does come out equal to&nbsp;$q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB)$, as
it should. But I will leave that for you to play with.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p43" class="para">
<p class="p">“I would like to emphasize that in the general case, for instance in
the relativistic formula, the action integrand no longer has the form of
the kinetic energy minus the potential energy. That’s only true in the
nonrelativistic approximation. For example, the
term&nbsp;$m_0c^2\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ is not what we have called the kinetic
energy. The question of what the action should be for any particular
case must be determined by some kind of trial and error. It is just the
same problem as determining what are the laws of motion in the first
place. You just have to fiddle around with the equations that you know
and see if you can get them into the form of the principle of least
action.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p44" class="para">
<p class="p">“One other point on terminology. The function that is integrated over
time to get the action&nbsp;$S$ is called the <em class="emph">Lagrangian</em>,
$\Lagrangian$,
which is a function only of the velocities and positions of particles.
So the principle of least action is also written
\begin{equation*}
S=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\Lagrangian(x_i,v_i)\,dt,
\end{equation*}
where by $x_i$ and&nbsp;$v_i$ are meant all the components of the positions
and velocities. So if you hear someone talking about the ‘Lagrangian,’
you know they are talking about the function that is used to
find&nbsp;$S$. For relativistic motion in an electromagnetic field
\begin{equation*}
\Lagrangian=-m_0c^2\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}-q(\phi-\FLPv\cdot\FLPA).
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p45" class="para">
<p class="p">“Also, I should say that $S$ is not really called the ‘action’ by the
most precise and pedantic people. It is called ‘Hamilton´s first
principal function.’ Now I hate to give a lecture on
‘the-principle-of-least-Hamilton’s-first-principal-function.’ So I call
it ‘the action.’ Also, more and more people are calling it the action.
You see, historically something else which is not quite as useful was
called the action, but I think it’s more sensible to change to a newer
definition. So now you too will call the new function the action, and
pretty soon everybody will call it by that simple name.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p46" class="para">
<p class="p">“Now I want to say some things on this subject which are similar to the
discussions I gave about the principle of least time. There is quite a
difference in the characteristic of a law which says a certain integral
from one place to another is a minimum—which tells something about the
whole path—and of a law which says that as you go along, there is a
force that makes it accelerate. The second way tells how you inch your
way along the path, and the other is a grand statement about the whole
path. In the case of light, we talked about the connection of these two.
Now, I would like to explain why it is true that there are differential
laws when there is a least action principle of this kind. The reason is
the following: Consider the actual path in space and time. As before,
let’s take only one dimension, so we can plot the graph of&nbsp;$x$ as a
function of&nbsp;$t$. Along the true path, $S$ is a minimum. Let’s suppose
that we have the true path and that it goes through some point&nbsp;$a$ in
space and time, and also through another nearby point&nbsp;$b$
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch19-F11">19–11</a>). Now if the entire integral from $t_1$ to&nbsp;$t_2$
is a minimum, it is also necessary that the integral along the little
section from $a$ to&nbsp;$b$ is also a minimum. It can’t be that the part
from $a$ to&nbsp;$b$ is a little bit more. Otherwise you could just fiddle
with just that piece of the path and make the whole integral a little
lower.

<div id="Ch19-S1-p47" class="para">
<p class="p">“So every subsection of the path must also be a minimum. And this is
true no matter how short the subsection. Therefore, the principle that
the whole path gives a minimum can be stated also by saying that an
infinitesimal section of path also has a curve such that it has a
minimum action. Now if we take a short enough section of
path—between two points $a$ and&nbsp;$b$ very close together—how the
potential varies from one place to another far away is not the
important thing, because you are staying almost in the same place over
the whole little piece of the path. The only thing that you have to
discuss is the first-order change in the potential. The answer can
only depend on the derivative of the potential and not on the
potential everywhere. So the statement about the gross property of the
whole path becomes a statement of what happens for a short section of
the path—a differential statement. And this differential statement
only involves the derivatives of the potential, that is, the force at
a point. That’s the qualitative explanation of the relation between
the gross law and the differential law.

</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p48" class="para">
<p class="p">“In the case of light we also discussed the question: How does the
particle find the right path? From the differential point of view, it
is easy to understand. Every moment it gets an acceleration and knows
only what to do at that instant. But all your instincts on cause and
effect go haywire when you say that the particle decides to take the
path that is going to give the minimum action. Does it ‘smell’ the
neighboring paths to find out whether or not they have more action? In
the case of light, when we put blocks in the way so that the photons
could not test all the paths, we found that they couldn’t figure out
which way to go, and we had the phenomenon of diffraction.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p49" class="para">
<p class="p">“Is the same thing true in mechanics? Is it true that the particle
doesn’t just ‘take the right path’ but that it looks at all the other
possible trajectories? And if by having things in the way, we don’t
let it look, that we will get an analog of diffraction? The miracle of
it all is, of course, that it does just that. That’s what the laws of
quantum mechanics say. So our principle of least action is
incompletely stated. It isn’t that a particle takes the path of least
action but that it smells all the paths in the neighborhood and
chooses the one that has the least action by a method analogous to the
one by which light chose the shortest time. You remember that the way
light chose the shortest time was this: If it went on a path that took
a different amount of time, it would arrive at a different phase. And
the total amplitude at some point is the sum of contributions of
amplitude for all the different ways the light can arrive. All the
paths that give wildly different phases don’t add up to anything. But
if you can find a whole sequence of paths which have phases almost all
the same, then the little contributions will add up and you get a
reasonable total amplitude to arrive. The important path becomes the
one for which there are many nearby paths which give the same phase.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p50" class="para">
<p class="p">“It is just exactly the same thing for quantum mechanics. The
complete quantum mechanics (for the nonrelativistic case and
neglecting electron spin) works as follows: The probability that a
particle starting at point&nbsp;$1$ at the time&nbsp;$t_1$ will arrive at
point&nbsp;$2$ at the time&nbsp;$t_2$ is the square of a probability amplitude. The
total amplitude can be written as the sum of the amplitudes for each
possible path—for each way of arrival. For every&nbsp;$x(t)$ that we
could have—for every possible imaginary trajectory—we have to
calculate an amplitude. Then we add them all together. What do we take
for the amplitude for each path? Our action integral tells us what the
amplitude for a single path ought to be. The amplitude is proportional
to some constant times&nbsp;$e^{iS/\hbar}$, where $S$ is the action for
that path. That is, if we represent the phase of the amplitude by a
complex number, the phase angle is&nbsp;$S/\hbar$. The action&nbsp;$S$ has
dimensions of energy times time, and 
Planck’s constant&nbsp;$\hbar$ has the
same dimensions. It is the constant that determines when quantum
mechanics is important.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p51" class="para">
<p class="p">“Here is how it works: Suppose that for all paths, $S$ is very large
compared to&nbsp;$\hbar$. One path contributes a certain amplitude. For a
nearby path, the phase is quite different, because with an enormous&nbsp;$S$
even a small change in&nbsp;$S$ means a completely different phase—because
$\hbar$ is so tiny. So nearby paths will normally cancel their effects
out in taking the sum—except for one region, and that is when a path
and a nearby path all give the same phase in the first approximation
(more precisely, the same action within&nbsp;$\hbar$). Only those paths will
be the important ones. So in the limiting case in which Planck’s
constant&nbsp;$\hbar$ goes to zero, the
correct quantum-mechanical laws can be summarized by simply saying:
‘Forget about all these probability amplitudes. The particle does go on
a special path, namely, that one for which $S$ does not vary in the
first approximation.’ That’s the relation between the principle of least
action and quantum mechanics. The fact that quantum mechanics can be
formulated in this way was discovered in 1942 by a student of that same
teacher, Bader, I spoke of at the beginning of this lecture. [Quantum
mechanics was originally formulated by giving a differential equation
for the amplitude (Schrödinger) and also by some other matrix mathematics
(Heisenberg).]

<div id="Ch19-S1-p52" class="para">
<p class="p">“Now I want to talk about other minimum principles in physics. There
are many very interesting ones. I will not try to list them all now
but will only describe one more. Later on, when we come to a physical
phenomenon which has a nice minimum principle, I will tell about it
then. I want now to show that we can describe electrostatics, not by
giving a differential equation for the field, but by saying that a
certain integral is a maximum or a minimum. First, let’s take the case
where the charge density is known everywhere, and the problem is to
find the potential&nbsp;$\phi$ everywhere in space. You know that the
answer should be
\begin{equation*}
\nabla^2\phi=-\rho/\epsO.
\end{equation*}
But another way of stating the same thing is this: Calculate the
integral&nbsp;$U\stared$, where
\begin{equation*}
U\stared=\frac{\epsO}{2}\int(\FLPgrad{\phi})^2\,dV-
\int\rho\phi\,dV,
\end{equation*}
which is a volume integral to be taken over all space. This thing is a
minimum for the correct potential distribution&nbsp;$\phi(x,y,z)$.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p53" class="para">
<p class="p">“We can show that the two statements about electrostatics are
equivalent. Let’s suppose that we pick any function&nbsp;$\phi$. We want to
show that when we take for&nbsp;$\phi$ the correct
potential&nbsp;$\underline{\phi}$, plus a small deviation&nbsp;$f$, then in the first
order, the change in&nbsp;$U\stared$ is zero. So we write
\begin{equation*}
\phi=\underline{\phi}+f.
\end{equation*}
The $\underline{\phi}$ is what we are looking for, but we are making a
variation of it to find what it has to be so that the variation
of&nbsp;$U\stared$ is zero to first order. For the first part of&nbsp;$U\stared$,
we need
\begin{equation*}
(\FLPgrad{\phi})^2=(\FLPgrad{\underline{\phi}})^2+
2\,\FLPgrad{\underline{\phi}}\cdot\FLPgrad{f}+
(\FLPgrad{f})^2.
\end{equation*}
The only first-order term that will vary is
\begin{equation*}
2\,\FLPgrad{\underline{\phi}}\cdot\FLPgrad{f}.
\end{equation*}
In the second term of the quantity&nbsp;$U\stared$, the integrand is
\begin{equation*}
\rho\phi=\rho\underline{\phi}+\rho f,
\end{equation*}
whose variable part is&nbsp;$\rho f$. So, keeping only the variable parts,
we need the integral
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U\stared=\int(\epsO\FLPgrad{\underline{\phi}}\cdot\FLPgrad{f}-
\rho f)\,dV.
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p54" class="para">
<p class="p">“Now, following the old general rule, we have to get the darn thing
all clear of derivatives of&nbsp;$f$. Let’s look at what the derivatives
are. The dot product is
\begin{equation*}
\ddp{\underline{\phi}}{x}\,\ddp{f}{x}+
\ddp{\underline{\phi}}{y}\,\ddp{f}{y}+
\ddp{\underline{\phi}}{z}\,\ddp{f}{z},
\end{equation*}
which we have to integrate with respect to&nbsp;$x$, to&nbsp;$y$, and to&nbsp;$z$. Now
here is the trick: to get rid of&nbsp;$\ddpl{f}{x}$ we integrate by parts
with respect to&nbsp;$x$. That will carry the derivative over onto
the&nbsp;$\underline{\phi}$. It’s the same general idea we used to get rid of
derivatives with respect to&nbsp;$t$. We use the equality
\begin{equation*}
\int\ddp{\underline{\phi}}{x}\,\ddp{f}{x}\,dx=
f\,\ddp{\underline{\phi}}{x}-
\int f\,\frac{\partial^2\underline{\phi}}{\partial x^2}\,dx.
\end{equation*}
The integrated term is zero, since we have to make $f$ zero at infinity.
(That corresponds to making $\eta$ zero at $t_1$ and&nbsp;$t_2$. So our
principle should be more accurately stated: $U\stared$ is less for the
true&nbsp;$\phi$ than for any other&nbsp;$\phi(x,y,z)$ having the same values at
infinity.) Then we do the same thing for $y$ and&nbsp;$z$. So our
integral&nbsp;$\Delta U\stared$ is
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U\stared=\int(-\epsO\nabla^2\underline{\phi}-\rho)f\,dV.
\end{equation*}
In order for this variation to be zero for any&nbsp;$f$, no matter what,
the coefficient of&nbsp;$f$ must be zero and, therefore,
\begin{equation*}
\nabla^2\underline{\phi}=-\rho/\epsO.
\end{equation*}
We get back our old equation. So our ‘minimum’ proposition is correct.

<div id="Ch19-S1-p55" class="para">
<p class="p">“We can generalize our proposition if we do our algebra in a little
different way. Let’s go back and do our integration by parts without
taking components. We start by looking at the following equality:
\begin{equation*}
\FLPdiv{(f\,\FLPgrad{\underline{\phi}})}=
\FLPgrad{f}\cdot\FLPgrad{\underline{\phi}}+f\,\nabla^2\underline{\phi}.
\end{equation*}
If I differentiate out the left-hand side, I can show that it is just
equal to the right-hand side. Now we can use this equation to integrate
by parts. In our integral&nbsp;$\Delta U\stared$, we replace
$\FLPgrad{\underline{\phi}}\cdot\FLPgrad{f}$
by&nbsp;$\FLPdiv{(f\,\FLPgrad{\underline{\phi}})}-f\,\nabla^2\underline{\phi}$,
which gets integrated over volume. The divergence term integrated over
volume can be replaced by a surface integral:
\begin{equation*}
\int\FLPdiv{(f\,\FLPgrad{\underline{\phi}})}\,dV=
\int f\,\FLPgrad{\underline{\phi}}\cdot\FLPn\,da.
\end{equation*}
Since we are integrating over all space, the surface over which we are
integrating is at infinity. There, $f$ is zero and we get the same
answer as before.

where all the charges are. Suppose that we have conductors with
charges spread out on them in some way. We can still use our minimum
principle if the potentials of all the conductors are fixed. We carry
out the integral for&nbsp;$U\stared$ only in the space outside of all
conductors. Then, since we can’t vary&nbsp;$\underline{\phi}$ on the
conductor, $f$ is zero on all those surfaces, and the surface integral
\begin{equation*}
\int f\,\FLPgrad{\underline{\phi}}\cdot\FLPn\,da
\end{equation*}
is still zero. The remaining volume integral
\begin{equation*}
\Delta U\stared=\int(-\epsO\,\nabla^2\underline{\phi}-\rho)f\,dV

is only to be carried out in the spaces between conductors. Of course,
we get Poisson’s equation again,
\begin{equation*}
\nabla^2\underline{\phi}=-\rho/\epsO.

So we have shown that our original integral&nbsp;$U\stared$ is also a minimum if
we evaluate it over the space outside of conductors all at fixed

<p class="p">“I would like to use this result to calculate something particular to
show you that these things are really quite practical. Suppose I take
two conductors in the form of a cylindrical condenser
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch19-F12">19–12</a>). The inside conductor has the potential&nbsp;$V$,
and the outside is at the potential zero. Let the radius of the inside
conductor be&nbsp;$a$ and that of the outside, $b$. Now we can suppose
<em class="emph">any</em> distribution of potential between the two. If we use the
<em class="emph">correct</em>&nbsp;$\underline{\phi}$, and
calculate&nbsp;$\epsO/2\int(\FLPgrad{\underline{\phi}})^2\,dV$, it should be
the energy of the system, $\tfrac{1}{2}CV^2$. So we can also
calculate&nbsp;$C$ by our principle. But if we use a wrong distribution of
potential and try to calculate the capacity&nbsp;$C$ by this method, we will
get a capacity that is too big, since $V$ is specified. Any assumed
potential&nbsp;$\phi$ that is not the exactly correct one will give a
fake&nbsp;$C$ that is larger than the correct value. But if my false&nbsp;$\phi$
is any rough approximation, the&nbsp;$C$ will be a good approximation,
because the error in&nbsp;$C$ is second order in the error in&nbsp;$\phi$.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S1-p59" class="para">
<p class="p">“Suppose I don’t know the capacity of a cylindrical condenser. I can
use this principle to find it. I just guess at the potential
function&nbsp;$\phi$ until I get the lowest&nbsp;$C$. Suppose, for instance, I pick a
potential that corresponds to a constant field. (You know, of course,
that the field isn’t really constant here; it varies as&nbsp;$1/r$.) A
field which is constant means a potential which goes linearly with
distance. To fit the conditions at the two conductors, it must be
\begin{equation*}
\phi=V\biggl(1-\frac{r-a}{b-a}\biggr).
\end{equation*}
This function is&nbsp;$V$ at&nbsp;$r=a$, zero at&nbsp;$r=b$, and in between has a
constant slope equal to&nbsp;$-V/(b-a)$. So what one does to find the
integral&nbsp;$U\stared$ is multiply the square of this gradient by&nbsp;$\epsO/2$
and integrate over all volume. Let’s do this calculation for a
cylinder of unit length. A volume element at the radius&nbsp;$r$ is&nbsp;$2\pi
r\,dr$. Doing the integral, I find that my first try at the capacity
gives
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2}\,CV^2(\text{first try})=\frac{\epsO}{2}
\int_a^b\frac{V^2}{(b-a)^2}\,2\pi r\,dr.
\end{equation*}
The integral is easy; it is just
\begin{equation*}
\pi V^2\biggl(\frac{b+a}{b-a}\biggr).

an approximate job:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{C}{2\pi\epsO}=\frac{b+a}{2(b-a)}.
\end{equation*}
It is, naturally, different from the correct
answer&nbsp;$C=2\pi\epsO/\ln(b/a)$, but it’s not too bad. Let’s compare it
with the right answer for several values of&nbsp;$b/a$. I have computed out
the answers in Table&nbsp;<a href="#Ch19-T1">19–1</a>. Even when $b/a$ is as big
as&nbsp;$2$—which gives a pretty big variation in the field compared with a
linearly varying field—I get a pretty fair approximation. The answer
is, of course, a little too high, as expected. The thing gets much worse
if you have a tiny wire inside a big cylinder. Then the field has
enormous variations and if you represent it by a constant, you’re not
doing very well. With&nbsp;$b/a=100$, we’re off by nearly a factor of two.
Things are much better for small&nbsp;$b/a$. To take the opposite extreme,
when the conductors are not very far apart—say&nbsp;$b/a=1.1$—then the
constant field is a pretty good approximation, and we get the correct
value for&nbsp;$C$ to within a tenth of a percent.

<p class="p">“Now I would like to tell you how to improve such a calculation. (Of
course, you <em class="emph">know</em> the right answer for the cylinder, but the
method is the same for some other odd shapes, where you may not know
the right answer.) The next step is to try a better approximation to
the unknown true&nbsp;$\phi$. For example, we might try a constant plus an
exponential&nbsp;$\phi$, etc. But how do you know when you have a better
approximation unless you know the true&nbsp;$\phi$? Answer: You
calculate&nbsp;$C$; the lowest&nbsp;$C$ is the value nearest the truth. Let us try this
idea out. Suppose that the potential is not linear but say quadratic
in&nbsp;$r$—that the electric field is not constant but linear. The most
<em class="emph">general</em> quadratic form that fits $\phi=0$ at&nbsp;$r=b$ and $\phi=V$
at&nbsp;$r=a$ is
\begin{equation*}
\phi=V\biggl[1+\alpha\biggl(\frac{r-a}{b-a}\biggr)-
(1+\alpha)\biggl(\frac{r-a}{b-a}\biggr)^2
\biggr],
\end{equation*}
where $\alpha$ is any constant number. This formula is a little more
complicated. It involves a quadratic term in the potential as well as
a linear term. It is very easy to get the field out of it. The field
is just
\begin{equation*}
E=-\ddt{\phi}{r}=-\frac{\alpha V}{b-a}+
2(1+\alpha)\,\frac{(r-a)V}{(b-a)^2}.
\end{equation*}
Now we have to square this and integrate over volume. But wait a moment.
What should I take for&nbsp;$\alpha$? I can take a parabola for the&nbsp;$\phi$;
but what parabola? Here’s what I do: Calculate the capacity with
<em class="emph">an arbitrary</em>&nbsp;$\alpha$. What I get is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{C}{2\pi\epsO}=\frac{a}{b-a}
\biggl[\frac{b}{a}\biggl(\frac{\alpha^2}{6}+
\frac{2\alpha}{3}+1\biggr)+
\frac{1}{6}\,\alpha^2+\frac{1}{3}\biggr].
\end{equation*}
It looks a little complicated, but it comes out of integrating the
square of the field. Now I can pick my&nbsp;$\alpha$. I know that the truth
lies lower than anything that I am going to calculate, so whatever I put
in for&nbsp;$\alpha$ is going to give me an answer too big. But if I keep
playing with&nbsp;$\alpha$ and get the lowest possible value I can, that
lowest value is nearer to the truth than any other value. So what I do
next is to pick the&nbsp;$\alpha$ that gives the minimum value for&nbsp;$C$.
Working it out by ordinary calculus, I get that the minimum&nbsp;$C$ occurs
for&nbsp;$\alpha=-2b/(b+a)$. Substituting that value into the formula, I
obtain for the minimum capacity
\begin{equation*}
\frac{C}{2\pi\epsO}=\frac{b^2+4ab+a^2}{3(b^2-a^2)}.
\end{equation*}

have&nbsp;$1.444$, which is a very good approximation to the true answer,
$1.4423$. Even for larger&nbsp;$b/a$, it stays pretty good—it is much,
much better than the first approximation. It is even fairly
good—only off by $10$&nbsp;percent—when $b/a$ is $10$ to&nbsp;$1$. But when

<span class="tag">19–2</span>A note added after the lecture</h3>

<div id="Ch19-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">“I should like to add something that I didn’t have time for in the
lecture. (I always seem to prepare more than I have time to tell about.)
As I mentioned earlier, I got interested in a problem while working on
this lecture. I want to tell you what that problem is. Among the minimum
principles that I could mention, I noticed that most of them sprang in
one way or another from the least action principle of mechanics and
electrodynamics. But there is also a class that does not. As an example,
if currents are made to go through a piece of material obeying
Ohm’s law, the currents distribute
themselves inside the piece so that the rate at which heat is generated
is as little as possible. Also we can say (if things are kept
isothermal) that the rate at which energy is generated is a minimum.
Now, this principle also holds, according to classical theory, in
determining even the distribution of velocities of the electrons inside
a metal which is carrying a current. The distribution of velocities is
not exactly the equilibrium distribution [Chapter&nbsp;<a href="I_40.html">40</a>,
Vol.&nbsp;I, Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="I_40.html#mjx-eqn-EqI406">40.6</a>)] because they are drifting sideways. The
new distribution can be found from the principle that it is the
distribution for a given current for which the entropy developed per
second by collisions is as small as possible. The true description of
the electrons’ behavior ought to be by quantum mechanics, however. The
question is: Does the same principle of minimum entropy generation also
hold when the situation is described quantum-mechanically? I haven’t
found out yet.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch19-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">“The question is interesting academically, of course. Such principles
are fascinating, and it is always worth while to try to see how general
they are. But also from a more practical point of view, I <em class="emph">want</em> to
know. I, with some colleagues, have published a paper in which we
calculated by quantum mechanics approximately the electrical resistance
felt by an electron moving through an ionic crystal like NaCl.
[Feynman, Hellwarth, Iddings,
and Platzman, “Mobility of Slow Electrons in a Polar Crystal,”
<i>Phys. Rev.</i> <b>127</b>, 1004 (1962).] But if a minimum
principle existed, we could use it to make the results much more
accurate, just as the minimum principle for the capacity of a condenser
permitted us to get such accuracy for that capacity even though we had
only a rough knowledge of the electric field.”
