<p class="p">So far we have been discussing the properties of matter from the
atomic point of view, trying to understand roughly what will happen if
we suppose that things are made of atoms obeying certain
laws. However, there are a number of relationships among the
properties of substances which can be worked out without consideration
of the detailed structure of the materials. The determination of the
relationships among the various properties of materials, without
knowing their internal structure, is the subject of
<em class="emph">thermodynamics</em>. Historically, thermodynamics was developed
before an understanding of the internal structure of matter was
achieved.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">To give an example: we know from the kinetic theory that the pressure
of a gas is caused by molecular bombardment, and we know that if we
heat a gas, so that the bombardment increases, the pressure must
increase. Conversely, if the piston in a container of the gas is moved
inward against the force of bombardment, the energy of the molecules
bombarding the piston will increase, and consequently the temperature
will increase. So, on the one hand, if we increase the temperature at
a given volume, we increase the pressure. On the other hand, if we
compress the gas, we will find that the temperature will rise. From
the kinetic theory, one can derive a quantitative relationship between
these two effects, but instinctively one might guess that they are
related in some necessary fashion which is independent of the details
of the collisions.</p>

<div id="Ch44-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Let us consider another example. Many people are familiar with this
interesting property of rubber: If we take a rubber band and pull it,
it gets warm. If one puts it between his lips, for example, and pulls
it out, he can feel a distinct warming, and this warming is reversible
in the sense that if he relaxes the rubber band quickly while it is
between his lips, it is distinctly cooled. That means that when we
stretch a rubber band it heats, and when we release the tension of the
band it cools. Now our instincts might suggest that if we heated a
band, it might pull: that the fact that pulling a band heats it might
imply that heating a band should cause it to contract. And, in fact,
if we apply a gas flame to a rubber band holding a weight, we will see
that the band contracts abruptly (Fig. <a href="#Ch44-F1">44–1</a>). So it is
true that when we heat a rubber band it pulls, and this fact is
definitely related to the fact that when we release the tension of it,
it cools.</p>

<div id="Ch44-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">The internal machinery of rubber that causes these effects is quite
complicated. We will describe it from a molecular point of view to
some extent, although our main purpose in this chapter is to
understand the relationship of these effects independently of the
molecular model. Nevertheless, we can show from the molecular model
that the effects are closely related. One way to understand the
behavior of rubber is to recognize that this substance consists of an
enormous tangle of long chains of molecules, a kind of “molecular
spaghetti,” with one extra complication: between the chains there are
cross-links—like spaghetti that is sometimes welded together where
it crosses another piece of spaghetti—a grand tangle. When we pull
out such a tangle, some of the chains tend to line up along the
direction of the pull. At the same time, the chains are in thermal
motion, so they hit each other continually. It follows that such a
chain, if stretched, would not by itself remain stretched, because it
would be hit from the sides by the other chains and other molecules,
and would tend to kink up again. So the real reason why a rubber band
tends to contract is this: when one pulls it out, the chains are
lengthwise, and the thermal agitations of the molecules on the sides
of the chains tend to kink the chains up, and make them shorten. One
can then appreciate that if the chains are held stretched and the
temperature is increased, so that the vigor of the bombardment on the
sides of the chains is also increased, the chains tend to pull in, and
they are able to pull a stronger weight when heated. If, after being
stretched for a time, a rubber band is allowed to relax, each chain
becomes soft, and the molecules striking it lose energy as they pound
into the relaxing chain. So the temperature falls.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We have seen how these two processes, contraction when heated and
cooling during relaxation, can be related by the kinetic theory, but it
would be a tremendous challenge to determine from the theory the precise
relationship between the two. We would have to know how many collisions
there were each second and what the chains look like, and we would have
to take account of all kinds of other complications. The detailed
mechanism is so complex that we cannot, by kinetic theory, really
determine exactly what happens; still, a definite relation between the
two effects we observe can be worked out without knowing anything about
the internal machinery!</p>

<div id="Ch44-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">The whole subject of thermodynamics depends essentially upon the
following kind of consideration: because a rubber band is “stronger”
at higher temperatures than it is at lower temperatures, it ought to
be possible to lift weights, and to move them around, and thus to do
work with heat. In fact, we have already seen experimentally that a
heated rubber band can lift a weight. The study of the way that one
does work with heat is the beginning of the science of
thermodynamics. Can we make an engine which uses the heating effect on
a rubber band to do work? One can make a silly looking engine that
does just this. It consists of a bicycle wheel in which all the spokes
are rubber bands (Fig. <a href="#Ch44-F2">44–2</a>). If one heats the rubber
bands on one side of the wheel with a pair of heat lamps, they become
“stronger” than the rubber bands on the other side. The center of
gravity of the wheel will be pulled to one side, away from the
bearing, so that the wheel turns. As it turns, cool rubber bands move
toward the heat, and the heated bands move away from the heat and
cool, so that the wheel turns slowly so long as the heat is
applied. The efficiency of this engine is extremely low. Four hundred
watts of power pour into the two lamps, but it is just possible to
lift a fly with such an engine! An interesting question, however, is
whether we can get heat to do the work in more efficient ways.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">In fact, the science of thermodynamics began with an analysis, by the
great engineer Sadi Carnot, of the problem of how to build the best and
most efficient engine, and this constitutes one of the few famous cases
in which engineering has contributed fundamentally to physical theory.
Another example that comes to mind is the more recent analysis of
information theory by Claude
Shannon.
These two analyses, incidentally, turn out to be closely
related.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Now the way a steam engine ordinarily operates is that heat from a
fire boils some water, and the steam so formed expands and pushes on a
piston which makes a wheel go around. So the steam pushes the
piston—what then? One has to finish the job: a stupid way to
complete the cycle would be to let the steam escape into the air, for
then one has to keep supplying water. It is cheaper—more
efficient—to let the steam go into another box, where it is
condensed by cool water, and then pump the water back into the boiler,
so that it circulates continuously. Heat is thus supplied to the
engine and converted into work. Now would it be better to use alcohol?
What property should a substance have so that it makes the best possible
engine? That was the question to which Carnot addressed himself, and one
of the by-products was the discovery of the type of relationship that we
have just explained above.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">The results of thermodynamics are all contained implicitly in certain
apparently simple statements called the <em class="emph">laws of thermodynamics</em>.
At the time when Carnot lived, the first law of thermodynamics, the
conservation of energy, was not known. Carnot’s arguments were so
carefully drawn, however, that they are valid even though the first law
was not known in his time! Some time afterwards,
Clapeyron made a
simpler derivation that could be understood more easily than Carnot’s
very subtle reasoning. But it turned out that
Clapeyron
assumed, not the conservation of energy in general, but that <em class="emph">heat</em>
was conserved according to the caloric theory, which was later shown to
be false. So it has often been said that Carnot’s logic was wrong. But
his logic was quite correct. Only
Clapeyron’s
simplified version, that everybody read, was incorrect.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">The so-called second law of thermodynamics was thus discovered by Carnot
before the first law! It would be interesting to give Carnot’s argument
that did not use the first law, but we shall not do so because we want
to learn physics, not history. We shall use the first law from the
start, in spite of the fact that a great deal can be done without it.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">Let us begin by stating the first law, the conservation of energy: if
one has a system and puts heat into it, and does work on it, then its
energy is increased by the heat put in and the work done. We can write
this as follows: The heat $Q$ put into the system, plus the work $W$
done on the system, is the increase in the energy $U$ of the system;
the latter energy is sometimes called the internal energy:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:1}
\text{Change in $U$} = Q + W.
\end{equation}
The change in $U$ can be represented as adding a little heat $\Delta
Q$ and adding a little work $\Delta W$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:2}
\Delta U = \Delta Q + \Delta W,
\end{equation}
which is a differential form of the same law. We know that very well,
from an earlier chapter.</p>

<div id="Ch44-S2" class="section">
<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">44–2</span>The second law</h3>
<div id="Ch44-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now, what about the second law of thermodynamics? We know that if we
do work against friction, say, the work lost to us is equal to the
heat produced. If we do work in a room at temperature $T$, and we do
the work slowly enough, the room temperature does not change much, and
we have converted work into heat at a given temperature. What about
the reverse possibility? Is it possible to convert the heat back into
work at a given temperature? The second law of thermodynamics asserts
that it is not. It would be very convenient to be able to convert heat
into work merely by reversing a process like friction. If we consider
only the conservation of energy, we might think that heat energy, such
as that in the vibrational motions of molecules, might provide a goodly
supply of useful energy. But Carnot assumed that it is impossible to
extract the energy of heat at a single temperature. In other words, if
the whole world were at the same temperature, one could not convert any
of its heat energy into work: while the process of making work go into
heat can take place at a given temperature, one cannot reverse it to get
the work back again. Specifically, Carnot assumed that heat cannot be
taken in at a certain temperature and converted into work <em class="emph">with no
other change</em> in the system or the surroundings.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">That last phrase is very important. Suppose we have a can of compressed
air at a certain temperature, and we let the air expand. It can do work;
it can make hammers go, for example. It cools off a little in the
expansion, but if we had a big sea, like the ocean, at a given
temperature—a heat reservoir—we could warm it up again. So we have
taken the heat out of the sea, and we have done work with the compressed
air. But Carnot was not wrong, because <em class="emph">we did not leave everything
as it was</em>. If we recompress the air that we let expand, we will find we
are doing extra work, and when we are finished we will discover that we
not only got no work out of the system at temperature $T$, but we
actually put some in. We must talk only about situations in which the
<em class="emph">net result</em> of the whole process is to take heat away and convert
it into work, just as the net result of the process of doing work
against friction is to take work and convert it into heat. If we move in
a circle, we can bring the system back precisely to its starting point,
with the net result that we did work against friction and produced heat.
Can we reverse the process? Turn a switch, so that everything goes
backwards, so the friction does work against us, and cools the sea?
According to Carnot: no! So let us suppose that this is impossible.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">If it were possible it would mean, among other things, that we could
take heat out of a cold body and put it into a hot body at no cost, as
it were. Now we know it is natural that a hot thing can warm up a cool
thing; if we simply put a hot body and a cold one together, and change
nothing else, our experience assures us that it is not going to happen
that the hot one gets hotter, and the cold one gets colder! But if we
could obtain work by extracting the heat out of the ocean, say, or from
anything else at a single temperature, then that work could be converted
back into heat by friction at some other temperature. For instance, the
other arm of a working machine could be rubbing something that is
already hot. The net result would be to take heat from a “cold” body,
the ocean, and to put it into a hot body. Now, the hypothesis of Carnot,
the second law of thermodynamics, is sometimes stated as follows: heat
cannot, of itself, flow from a cold to a hot object. But, as we have
just seen, these two statements are equivalent: first, that one cannot
devise a process whose only result is to convert heat to work at a
single temperature, and second, that one cannot make heat flow by itself
from a cold to a hot place. We shall mostly use the first form.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Carnot’s analysis of heat engines is quite similar to the argument that
we gave about weight-lifting engines in our discussion of the
conservation of energy in Chapter <a href="I_04.html">4</a>. In fact, that argument
was patterned after Carnot’s argument about heat engines, and so the
present treatment will sound very much the same.</p>

<div id="Ch44-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose we build a heat engine that has a “boiler” somewhere at a
temperature $T_1$. A certain heat $Q_1$ is taken from the boiler, the
steam engine does some work $W$, and it then delivers some heat $Q_2$
into a “condenser” at another temperature $T_2$
(Fig. <a href="#Ch44-F3">44–3</a>). Carnot did not say how much heat, because he
did not know the first law, and he did not use the law that $Q_2$ was
equal to $Q_1$ because he did not believe it. Although everybody thought
that, according to the caloric theory, the heats $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ would
have to be the same, Carnot did not say they were the same—that is
part of the cleverness of his argument. If we do use the first law, we
find that the heat delivered, $Q_2$, is the heat $Q_1$ that was put in
minus the work $W$ that was done:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:3}
Q_2 = Q_1 - W.
\end{equation}
(If we have some kind of cyclic process where water is pumped back
into the boiler after it is condensed, we will say that we have
heat $Q_1$ absorbed and work $W$ done, during each cycle, for a certain
amount of water that goes around the cycle.)</p>

<div id="Ch44-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we shall build another engine, and see if we cannot get more work
from the same amount of heat being delivered at the temperature $T_1$,
with the condenser still at the temperature $T_2$. We shall use the
same amount of heat $Q_1$ from the boiler, and we shall try to get
more work than we did out of the steam engine, perhaps by using
another fluid, such as alcohol.</p>

<span class="tag">44–3</span>Reversible engines</h3>
<div id="Ch44-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we must analyze our engines. One thing is clear: we will lose
something if the engines contain devices in which there is
friction. The best engine will be a frictionless engine. We assume,
then, the same idealization that we did when we studied the
conservation of energy; that is, a perfectly frictionless engine.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch44-S3-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We must also consider the analog of frictionless motion,
“frictionless” heat transfer. If we put a hot object at a high
temperature against a cold object, so that the heat flows, then it is
not possible to make that heat flow in a reverse direction by a very
small change in the temperature of either object. But when we have a
practically frictionless machine, if we push it with a little force
one way, it goes that way, and if we push it with a little force the
other way, it goes the other way. We need to find the analog of
frictionless motion: heat transfer whose direction we can reverse with
only a tiny change. If the difference in temperature is finite, that
is impossible, but if one makes sure that heat flows always between
two things at essentially the same temperature, with just an
infinitesimal difference to make it flow in the desired direction, the
flow is said to be reversible (Fig. <a href="#Ch44-F4">44–4</a>). If we heat
the object on the left a little, heat will flow to the right; if we
cool it a little, heat will flow to the left. So we find that the
ideal engine is a so-called <em class="emph">reversible</em> engine, in which every
process is reversible in the sense that, by minor changes,
infinitesimal changes, we can make the engine go in the opposite
direction. That means that nowhere in the machine must there be any
appreciable friction, and nowhere in the machine must there be any
place where the heat of the reservoirs, or the flame of the boiler, is
in direct contact with something definitely cooler or warmer.</p>

<div id="Ch44-S3-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Let us now consider an idealized engine in which all the processes are
reversible. To show that such a thing is possible in principle, we
will give an example of an engine cycle which may or may not be
practical, but which is at least reversible, in the sense of Carnot’s
idea. Suppose that we have a gas in a cylinder equipped with a
frictionless piston. The gas is not necessarily a perfect gas. The
fluid does not even have to be a gas, but to be specific let us say we
do have a perfect gas. Also, suppose that we have two heat pads, $T_1$
and $T_2$—great big things that have definite temperatures, $T_1$
and $T_2$. We will suppose in this case that $T_1$ is higher
than $T_2$. Let us first heat the gas and at the same time expand it, while
it is in contact with the heat pad at $T_1$. As we do this, pulling
the piston out very slowly as the heat flows into the gas, we will
make sure that the temperature of the gas never gets very far
from $T_1$. If we pull the piston out too fast, the temperature of the gas
will fall too much below $T_1$ and then the process will not be quite
reversible, but if we pull it out slowly enough, the temperature of
the gas will never depart much from $T_1$. On the other hand, if we
push the piston back slowly, the temperature would be only
infinitesimally higher than $T_1$, and the heat would pour back. We
see that such an isothermal (constant-temperature)
expansion, done
slowly and gently enough, is a reversible process.

<p class="p">To understand what we are doing, we shall use a plot
(Fig. <a href="#Ch44-F6">44–6</a>) of the pressure of the gas against its volume.
As the gas expands, the pressure falls. The curve marked (1) tells us
how the pressure and volume change if the temperature is kept fixed at
the value $T_1$. For an ideal gas this curve would be $PV = NkT_1$.
During an isothermal expansion the pressure falls as the volume
increases until we stop at the point $b$. At the same time, a certain
heat $Q_1$ must flow into the gas from the reservoir, for if the gas
were expanded without being in contact with the reservoir it would cool
off, as we already know. Having completed the isothermal expansion,
stopping at the point $b$, let us take the cylinder away from the
reservoir and continue the expansion. This time we permit no heat to
enter the cylinder. Again we perform the expansion slowly, so there is
no reason why we cannot reverse it, and we again assume there is no
friction. The gas continues to expand and the temperature falls, since
there is no longer any heat entering the cylinder.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We let the gas expand, following the curve marked (2), until the
temperature falls to $T_2$, at the point marked $c$. This kind of
expansion, made without adding heat, is called an <em class="emph">adiabatic</em>
expansion.
For an ideal gas, we already know that curve (2) has the
form $PV^\gamma = \text{constant}$, where $\gamma$ is a constant
greater than $1$, so that the adiabatic curve has a more negative
slope than the isothermal curve. The gas cylinder has now reached the
temperature $T_2$, so that if we put it on the heat pad at
temperature $T_2$ there will be no irreversible changes. Now we slowly compress
the gas while it is in contact with the reservoir at $T_2$, following
the curve marked (3) (Fig. <a href="#Ch44-F5">44–5</a>, Step 3). Because the
cylinder is in contact with the reservoir, the temperature does not
rise, but heat $Q_2$ flows from the cylinder into the reservoir at the
temperature $T_2$. Having compressed the gas isothermally along
curve (3) to the point $d$, we remove the cylinder from the heat pad at
temperature $T_2$ and compress it still further, without letting any
heat flow out. The temperature will rise, and the pressure will follow
the curve marked (4). If we carry out each step properly, we can
return to the point $a$ at temperature $T_1$ where we started, and
repeat the cycle.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">We see that on this diagram we have carried the gas around a complete
cycle, and during one cycle we have put $Q_1$ in at temperature $T_1$,
and have removed $Q_2$ at temperature $T_2$. Now the point is that
this cycle is reversible, so that we could represent all the steps the
other way around. We could have gone backwards instead of forwards: we
could have started at point $a$, at temperature $T_1$, expanded along
the curve (4), expanded further at the temperature $T_2$, absorbing
heat $Q_2$, and so on, going around the cycle backward. If we go
around the cycle in one direction, we must do work on the gas; if we
go in the other direction, the gas does work on us.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S3-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Incidentally, it is easy to find out what the total amount of work is,
because the work during any expansion is the pressure times the change
in volume, $\int P\,dV$. On this particular diagram, we have
plotted $P$ vertically and $V$ horizontally. So if we call the vertical
distance $y$ and the horizontal distance $x$, this is $\int
y\,dx$—in other words, the area under the curve. So the area under
each of the numbered curves is a measure of the work done by or on the
gas in the corresponding step. It is easy to see that the net work
done is the shaded area of the picture.</p>

<div id="Ch44-S3-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Now that we have given a single example of a reversible machine, we
shall suppose that other such engines are also possible. Let us assume
that we have a reversible engine $A$ which takes $Q_1$ at $T_1$, does
work $W$, and delivers some heat at $T_2$. Now let us assume we have
any other engine $B$, made by man, already designed or not yet
invented, made of rubber bands, steam, or whatever, reversible or not,
which is designed so that it takes in the same amount of heat $Q_1$
at $T_1$, and rejects the heat at the lower temperature $T_2$
(Fig. <a href="#Ch44-F7">44–7</a>). Assume that engine $B$ does some work, $W'$.
Now we shall show that $W'$ is not greater than $W$—that no engine can
do more work than a reversible one. Why?  Suppose that, indeed, $W'$
were bigger than $W$. Then we could take the heat $Q_1$ out of the
reservoir at $T_1$, and with engine $B$ we could do work $W'$ and
deliver some heat to the reservoir at $T_2$; we do not care how much.
That done, we could save some of the work $W'$, which is supposed to be
greater than $W$; we could use a part of it, $W$, and save the
remainder, $W' - W$, for useful work. With the work $W$ we could run
engine $A$ backwards <em class="emph">because it is a reversible engine</em>. It will
absorb some heat from the reservoir at $T_2$ and deliver $Q_1$ back to
the reservoir at $T_1$. After this double cycle, the net result would be
that we would have put everything back the way it was before, and we
would have done some excess work, namely $W' - W$, and <em class="emph">all</em> we
would have done would be to extract energy from the reservoir at $T_2$!
We were careful to restore the heat $Q_1$ to the reservoir at $T_1$. So
that reservoir can be small and “inside” our combined machine $A + B$,
whose net effect is therefore to extract a net heat $W' - W$ from the
reservoir at $T_2$ and convert it into work. But to obtain useful work
from a reservoir at a single temperature <em class="emph">with no other changes</em> is
impossible according to Carnot’s postulate; it cannot be done. Therefore
no engine which absorbs a given amount of heat from a higher
temperature $T_1$ and delivers it at the temperature $T_2$ can do more work than a
reversible engine operating under the same temperature conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S3-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Now suppose that engine $B$ is also reversible. Then, of course, not
only must $W'$ be not greater than $W$, but now we can reverse the
argument and show that $W$ cannot be greater than $W'$. So, if both
engines are reversible they must both do the same amount of work, and
we thus come to Carnot’s brilliant conclusion: that if an engine is
reversible, it makes no difference how it is designed, because the
amount of work one will obtain if the engine absorbs a given amount of
heat at temperature $T_1$ and delivers heat at some other
temperature $T_2$ <em class="emph">does not depend on the design of the engine</em>. It is a

<p class="p">If we could find out what the law is that determines how much work we
obtain when we absorb the heat $Q_1$ at $T_1$ and deliver heat
at $T_2$, this quantity would be a universal thing, independent of the
substance. Of course if we knew the properties of a particular
substance, we could work it out and then say that all other substances
must give the same amount of work in a reversible engine. That is the
key idea, the clue by which we can find the relationship between how
much, for instance, a rubber band contracts when we heat it, and how
much it cools when we let it contract. Imagine that we put that rubber
band in a reversible machine, and that we make it go around a
reversible cycle. The net result, the total amount of work done, is
that universal function, that great function which is independent of
substance. So we see that a substance’s properties must be limited in
a certain way; one cannot make up anything he wants, or he would be
able to invent a substance which he could use to produce more than the
maximum allowable work when he carried it around a reversible
cycle. This principle, this limitation, is the only real rule that
comes out of the thermodynamics.</p>

<p class="p">Now we shall try to find the law which determines the work $W$ as a

proportional to $Q_1$, for if we consider two reversible engines in
parallel, both working together and both double engines, the
combination is also a reversible engine. If each one absorbed
heat $Q_1$, the two together absorb $2Q_1$ and the work done is $2W$, and
so on. So it is not unreasonable that $W$ is proportional to $Q_1$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now the next important step is to find this universal law. We can, and
will, do so by studying a reversible engine with the one particular
substance whose laws we know, a perfect gas. It is also possible to
obtain the rule by a purely logical argument, using no particular
substance at all. This is one of the very beautiful pieces of
reasoning in physics and we are reluctant not to show it to you, so
for those who would like to see it we shall discuss it in just a
moment. But first we shall use the much less abstract and simpler
method of direct calculation for a perfect gas.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We need only obtain formulas for $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ (for $W$ is just $Q_1
- Q_2$), the heats exchanged with the reservoirs during the isothermal
expansion or contraction. For example, how much heat $Q_1$ is absorbed
from the reservoir at temperature $T_1$ during the isothermal
expansion [marked (1) in Fig. <a href="#Ch44-F6">44–6</a>] from point $a$, at
pressure $p_a$, volume $V_a$, temperature $T_1$, to point $b$ with
pressure $p_b$, volume $V_b$, and the same temperature $T_1$? For a
perfect gas each molecule has an energy that depends only on the
temperature, and since the temperature and the number of molecules are
the same at $a$ and at $b$, the internal energy is the
same. <em class="emph">There is no change in $U$;</em> all the work done by the gas,
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_a^bp\,dV,
\end{equation*}
during the expansion is energy $Q_1$ taken from the reservoir. During
the expansion, $pV = NkT_1$, or
\begin{equation}
p = \frac{NkT_1}{V}\notag
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:4}
Q_1 = \int_a^bp\,dV = \int_a^bNkT_1\,\frac{dV}{V}
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
Q_1 = NkT_1\ln\frac{V_b}{V_a}\notag
\end{equation}

is the heat taken from the reservoir at $T_1$. In the same way, for
the compression at $T_2$ [curve (3) of Fig. <a href="#Ch44-F6">44–6</a>] the
heat delivered to the reservoir at $T_2$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:5}
Q_2 = NkT_2\ln\frac{V_c}{V_d}.
\end{equation}
To finish our analysis we need only find a relation between $V_c/V_d$
and $V_b/V_a$. This we do by noting that (2) is an adiabatic expansion
from $b$ to $c$, during which $pV^\gamma$ is a constant. Since $pV =
NkT$, we can write this as $(pV)V^{\gamma - 1} = \text{const}$ or, in
terms of $T$ and $V$, as $TV^{\gamma - 1} = \text{const}$, or
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:6}
T_1V_b^{\gamma - 1} = T_2V_c^{\gamma - 1}.
\end{equation}
Likewise, since (4), the compression from $d$ to $a$, is also adiabatic,
we find
\begin{equation*}
T_1V_a^{\gamma - 1} = T_2V_d^{\gamma - 1}.
\tag{44.6a}
\label{Eq:I:44:6a}
\end{equation*}
If we divide this equation by the previous one, we find that $V_b/V_a$
must equal $V_c/V_d$, so the $\ln$’s in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI444">44.4</a>)
and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI445">44.5</a>) are equal, and that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:7}
\frac{Q_1}{T_1} = \frac{Q_2}{T_2}.
\end{equation}
This is the relation we were seeking. Although proved for a perfect
gas engine, we know it must be true <em class="emph">for any reversible engine at

<div id="Ch44-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we shall see how this universal law could also be obtained by
logical argument, without knowing the properties of any specific
substances, as follows. Suppose that we have three engines and three
temperatures, let us say $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$. Let one engine
absorb heat $Q_1$ from the temperature $T_1$ and do a certain amount
of work $W_{13}$, and let it deliver heat $Q_3$ to the
temperature $T_3$ (Fig. <a href="#Ch44-F8">44–8</a>). Let another engine run backwards
between $T_2$ and $T_3$. Suppose that we let the second engine be of
such a size that it will absorb the same heat $Q_3$, and deliver the
heat $Q_2$. We will have to put a certain amount of work, $W_{32}$,
into it—negative because the engine is running backwards. When the
first machine goes through a cycle, it absorbs heat $Q_1$ and delivers
$Q_3$ at the temperature $T_3$; then the second machine takes the same
heat $Q_3$ out of the reservoir at the temperature $T_3$ and delivers
it into the reservoir at temperature $T_2$. Therefore the net result
of the two machines in tandem is to take the heat $Q_1$ from $T_1$,
and deliver $Q_2$ at $T_2$. The two machines are thus equivalent to a
third one, which absorbs $Q_1$ at $T_1$, does work $W_{12}$, and
delivers heat $Q_2$ at $T_2$, because $W_{12} = W_{13} - W_{32}$, as
one can immediately show from the first law, as follows:
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:8}
W_{13} - W_{32} = (Q_1 - Q_3) - (Q_2 - Q_3) =
Q_1 - Q_2 = W_{12}.

\label{Eq:I:44:8}
&= Q_1 - Q_2 = W_{12}.
\end{align}
</span>
We can now obtain the laws which relate the efficiencies of the
engines, because there clearly must be some kind of relationship
between the efficiencies of engines running between the temperatures
$T_1$ and $T_3$, and between $T_2$ and $T_3$, and between $T_1$
and $T_2$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We can make the argument very clear in the following way: We have just
seen that we can always relate the heat absorbed at $T_1$ to the heat
delivered at $T_2$ by finding the heat delivered at some other
temperature $T_3$. Therefore we can get all the engines’ properties if
we introduce a standard temperature, analyzing everything with that
standard temperature. In other words, if we knew the efficiency of an
engine running between a certain temperature $T$ and a certain
arbitrary standard temperature, then we could work out the efficiency
for any other difference in temperature. Because we assume we are
using only reversible engines, we can work from the initial
temperature down to the standard temperature and back up to the final
temperature again. We shall define the standard temperature
arbitrarily as <em class="emph">one degree</em>. We shall also adopt a special symbol
for the heat which is delivered at this standard temperature: we shall
call it $Q_S$. In other words, when a reversible engine absorbs the
heat $Q$ at temperature $T$, it will deliver, at the unit temperature,
a heat $Q_S$. <em class="emph">If one engine, absorbing heat $Q_1$ at $T_1$,
delivers the heat $Q_S$ at one degree, and if an engine absorbing
heat $Q_2$ at temperature $T_2$ will also deliver the same heat $Q_S$ at
one degree, then it follows that an engine which absorbs heat $Q_1$ at
the temperature $T_1$ will deliver heat $Q_2$ if it runs between $T_1$
and $T_2$</em>, as we have already proved by considering engines running
between three temperatures. So all we really have to do is to find how
much heat $Q_1$ we need to put in at the temperature $T_1$ in order to
deliver a certain amount of heat $Q_S$ at the unit temperature. If we
discover that, we have everything. The heat $Q$, of course, is a
function of the temperature $T$. It is easy to see that the heat must
increase as the temperature increases, for we know that it takes work
to run an engine backwards and deliver heat at a higher
temperature. It is also easy to see that the heat $Q_1$ must be
proportional to $Q_S$. So the great law is something like this: for a
given amount of heat $Q_S$ delivered at one degree from an engine
running at temperature $T$ degrees, the heat $Q$ absorbed must be that
amount $Q_S$ times some increasing function of the temperature:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:9}
Q = Q_Sf(T).

degrees of a certain size. But when one then measures temperature with

which does not depend on what device we use, because the
efficiency of these reversible engines is independent of their working

This means that we can tell how hot an object is by finding out how
much heat is absorbed by a reversible engine working between the
temperature of the object and the unit temperature

boiler than is delivered at a one-degree condenser, the temperature of
the boiler will be called seven degrees, and so forth. So, by measuring
how much heat is absorbed at different temperatures, we determine the
temperature. The temperature defined in this way is called the
<em class="emph">absolute thermodynamic temperature</em>, and it is independent of the

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:12}
\frac{Q_1}{T_1} = S = \frac{Q_2}{T_2}.

But that means that if we have a single engine running between $T_1$

that $Q_1$ is to $T_1$ as $Q_2$ is to $T_2$, if the engine absorbs

<p class="p">If this is all there is to thermodynamics, why is it considered such a
difficult subject? In doing a problem involving a given mass of some
substance, the condition of the substance at any moment can be
described by telling what its temperature is and what its volume
is. If we know the temperature and volume of a substance, and that the
pressure is some function of the temperature and volume, then we know
the internal energy. One could say, “I do not want to do it that
way. Tell me the temperature and the pressure, and I will tell you the
volume. I can think of the volume as a function of temperature and
pressure, and the internal energy as a function of temperature and
pressure, and so on.” That is why thermodynamics is hard, because
everyone uses a different approach. If we could only sit down once and

</div>
<div id="Ch44-S5-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We begin. To obtain our first conclusion, we shall combine both laws,
the law of conservation of energy and this law which relates the heats
$Q_2$ and $Q_1$, and we can easily obtain <em class="emph">the efficiency of a

Q_2$. According to our new principle,
\begin{equation}
Q_2 = \frac{T_2}{T_1}\,Q_1,\notag
\end{equation}
so the work becomes
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:13}
W = Q_1\biggl(1 - \frac{T_2}{T_1}\biggr) = Q_1\,
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1},
\end{equation}
which tells us the efficiency of the engine—how much work we get out
of so much heat. The efficiency of an engine is proportional to the
difference in the temperatures between which the engine runs, divided
by the higher temperature:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:14}
\text{Efficiency} = \frac{W}{Q_1} = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1}.
\end{equation}
The efficiency cannot be greater than unity and the absolute
temperature cannot be less than zero, absolute zero. So, since $T_2$ must be positive, the efficiency is always less
than unity. That is our first conclusion.

<p class="p">Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI447">44.7</a>) or (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI4412">44.12</a>) can be interpreted in
a special way. Working always with reversible engines, a heat $Q_1$ at
temperature $T_1$ is “equivalent” to $Q_2$ at $T_2$ if $Q_1/T_1 =
Q_2/T_2$, in the sense that as one is absorbed the other is
delivered. This suggests that if we call $Q/T$ something, we can say:
in a reversible process as much $Q/T$ is absorbed as is liberated;
there is no gain or loss of $Q/T$. This $Q/T$ is called
<em class="emph">entropy</em>, and we say “there is no net change in entropy in a
reversible cycle.” If $T$ is $1^\circ$, then the entropy
is $Q_S/1^\circ$ or, as we symbolized it, $Q_S/1^\circ = S$. Actually,
$S$ is the letter usually used for entropy, and it is numerically
equal to the heat (which we have called $Q_S$) delivered to
a $1^\circ$-reservoir (entropy is not itself a heat, it is heat divided
by a temperature, hence it is measured in <em class="emph">joules per degree</em>).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now it is interesting that besides the pressure, which is a function
of the temperature and the volume, and the internal energy, which is a
function of temperature and volume, we have found another quantity
which is a function of the condition, i.e., the entropy of the
substance. Let us try to explain how we compute it, and what we mean
when we call it a “function of the condition.” Consider the system
in two different conditions, much as we had in the experiment where we
did the adiabatic and isothermal expansions. (Incidentally, there is
no need that a heat engine have only two reservoirs, it could have
three or four different temperatures at which it takes in and delivers
heats, and so on.) We can move around on a $pV$ diagram all over the
place, and go from one condition to another. In other words, we could
say the gas is in a certain condition $a$, and then it goes over to
some other condition, $b$, and we will require that this transition,
made from $a$ to $b$, be reversible. Now suppose that all along the
path from $a$ to $b$ we have little reservoirs at different
temperatures, so that the heat $dQ$ removed from the substance at each
little step is delivered to each reservoir at the temperature
corresponding to that point on the path. Then let us connect all these
reservoirs, by reversible heat engines, to a single reservoir at the
unit temperature. When we are finished carrying the substance from $a$
to $b$, we shall bring all the reservoirs back to their original
condition. Any heat $dQ$ that has been absorbed from the substance at
temperature $T$ has now been converted by a reversible machine, and a
certain amount of entropy $dS$ has been delivered at the unit
temperature as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:15}
dS = dQ/T.

<div id="Ch44-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Let us compute the total amount of entropy which has been
delivered. The entropy difference, or the entropy needed to go from
$a$ to $b$ by this particular reversible transformation, is the total
entropy, the total of the entropy taken out of the little reservoirs,
and delivered at the unit temperature:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:16}
S_b - S_a = \int_a^b\frac{dQ}{T}.
\end{equation}
The question is, does the entropy difference depend upon the path
taken? There is more than one way to go from $a$ to $b$. Remember that
in the Carnot cycle we could go from $a$ to $c$ in Fig. <a href="#Ch44-F6">44–6</a>
by first expanding isothermally and then adiabatically; or we could
first expand adiabatically and then isothermally. So the question is
whether the entropy change which occurs when we go from $a$ to $b$ in
Fig. <a href="#Ch44-F10">44–10</a> is the same on one route as it is on another.
<em class="emph">It must be the same</em>, because if we went all the way around the
cycle, going forward on one path and backward on another, we would have
a reversible engine, and there would be no loss of heat to the reservoir
at unit temperature. In a totally reversible cycle, no heat must be
taken from the reservoir at the unit temperature, so the entropy needed
to go from $a$ to $b$ is the same over one path as it is over another.
It is <em class="emph">independent of path</em>, and depends only on the endpoints. We
can, therefore, say that there is a certain function, which we call the
entropy of the substance, that depends only on the condition, i.e., only
on the volume and temperature.</p>

\Delta S = \int\frac{dQ}{T},

This total entropy change is the difference between the entropy

\Delta S = S(V_b,T_b) - S(V_a,T_a) = \int_a^b\frac{dQ}{T}.

is, but we will not explain why it is true. Nernst’s postulate states
simply that the entropy of any object at absolute zero is zero. We know of one case of $T$ and $V$, namely $T = 0$, where
$S$ is zero; and so we can get the entropy at any other point.

<p class="p">To give an illustration of these ideas, let us calculate the entropy

\begin{equation*}
S(V_a,T) - S(V_b,T) = Nk\ln\frac{V_a}{V_b},

so $S(V,T) = Nk\ln V$ plus some function of $T$ only. How does $S$
depend on $T$? We know that for a reversible adiabatic expansion,
<em class="emph">no heat is exchanged</em>. Thus the entropy does not change even
though $V$ changes, provided that $T$ changes also, such that
$TV^{\gamma - 1} = \text{constant}$. Can you see that this implies

heat delivered at unit temperature—increases according to the
rule $dS = dQ/T$, where $dQ$ is the heat we remove from the substance when
its temperature is $T$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S6-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">We already know that if we have a reversible <em class="emph">cycle</em>, the total
entropy of everything is not changed, because the heat $Q_1$ absorbed
at $T_1$ and the heat $Q_2$ delivered at $T_2$ correspond to equal and
opposite changes in entropy, so that the net change in the entropy is
zero. So for a reversible cycle there is no change in the entropy of
anything, including the reservoirs. This rule may look like the
conservation of energy again, but it is not; it applies only to
reversible cycles. If we include irreversible cycles there is no law
of conservation of entropy.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S6-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">We shall give two examples. First, suppose that we do irreversible
work on an object by friction, generating a heat $Q$ on some object at
temperature $T$. The entropy is increased by $Q/T$. The heat $Q$ is
equal to the work, and thus when we do a certain amount of work by
friction against an object whose temperature is $T$, the entropy of
the whole world increases by $W/T$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S6-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Another example of irreversibility is this: If we put together two
objects that are at different temperatures, say $T_1$ and $T_2$, a
certain amount of heat will flow from one to the other by
itself. Suppose, for instance, we put a hot stone in cold water. Then
when a certain heat $\Delta Q$ is transferred from $T_1$ to $T_2$, how
much does the entropy of the hot stone change? It decreases by $\Delta
Q/T_1$. How much does the water entropy change? It increases
by $\Delta Q/T_2$. The heat will, of course, flow only from the higher
temperature $T_1$ to the lower temperature $T_2$, so that $\Delta Q$
is positive if $T_1$ is greater than $T_2$. So the change in entropy
of the whole world is positive, and it is the difference of the two
fractions:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:I:44:19}
\Delta S = \frac{\Delta Q}{T_2} - \frac{\Delta Q}{T_1}.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch44-S6-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">So the following proposition is true: in any process that is
irreversible, the entropy of the whole world is increased. Only in
reversible processes does the entropy remain constant. Since no
process is absolutely reversible, there is always at least a small
gain in the entropy; a reversible process is an idealization in which
we have made the gain of entropy minimal.</p>

<div id="Ch44-S6-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">Unfortunately, we are not going to enter into the field of
thermodynamics very far. Our purpose is only to illustrate the principal
ideas involved and the reasons why it is possible to make such
arguments, but we will not use thermodynamics very much in this course.
Thermodynamics is used very often by engineers and, particularly, by
chemists. So we must learn our thermodynamics in practice in chemistry
or engineering. Because it is not worthwhile duplicating everything, we
shall just give some discussion of the origin of the theory, rather than
much detail for special applications.</p>

<div id="Ch44-S6-p13" class="para">
<p class="p" style="margin-bottom:1ex">The two laws of thermodynamics are often stated this way:</p>

<table class="tabular centering" style="margin-bottom:1ex">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top; text-align:right"><em class="emph">First&nbsp;law:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></td>

<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:top; text-align:right"><em class="emph">Second&nbsp;law:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></td>

</table>

<p>That is not a very good statement of the second law; it does not say,
for example, that in a reversible cycle the entropy stays the same,
and it does not say exactly what the entropy is. It is just a clever
way of remembering the two laws, but it does not really tell us
exactly where we stand. We have summarized the laws discussed in this
chapter in Table <a href="#Ch44-T1">44–1</a>. In the next chapter we shall apply
these laws to discover the relationship between the heat generated in
the expansion of a rubber band, and the extra tension when it is
heated.</p>

  We have previously defined our scale of temperature in a
different way, namely by stating that the mean kinetic energy of a
molecule in a perfect gas is proportional to the temperature, or that
the perfect gas law says $pV$ is proportional to $T$. Is this new
definition equivalent? Yes, since the final result (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqI447">44.7</a>)
derived from the gas law is the same as that derived here. We shall
discuss this point again in the next chapter.
