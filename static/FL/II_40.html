<p class="p">The subject of the flow of fluids, and particularly of water,
fascinates everybody. We can all remember, as children, playing in the
bathtub or in mud puddles with the strange stuff. As we get older, we
watch streams, waterfalls, and whirlpools, and we are fascinated by
this substance which seems almost alive relative to solids. The
behavior of fluids is in many ways very unexpected and
interesting—it is the subject of this chapter and the next. The
efforts of a child trying to dam a small stream flowing in the street
and his surprise at the strange way the water works its way out has
its analog in our attempts over the years to understand the flow of
fluids. We have tried to dam the water up—in our understanding—by
getting the laws and the equations that describe the flow. We will
describe these attempts in this chapter. In the next chapter, we will
describe the unique way in which water has broken through the dam and
escaped our attempts to understand it.

<p class="p">We suppose that the elementary properties of water are already known
to you. The main property that distinguishes a fluid from a solid is
that a fluid cannot <em class="emph">maintain</em> a shear stress for any length of
time. If a shear is applied to a fluid, it will move under the
shear. Thicker liquids like honey move less easily than fluids like
air or water. The measure of the ease with which a fluid yields is its
viscosity. In this chapter we will consider only situations in which
the viscous effects can be ignored. The effects of viscosity will be
taken up in the next chapter.

<div id="Ch40-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We begin by considering <em class="emph">hydrostatics</em>, the theory of liquids at
rest. When liquids are at rest, there are no shear forces (even for
viscous liquids). The law of hydrostatics, therefore, is that the
stresses are always normal to any surface inside the fluid. The normal
force per unit area is called the <em class="emph">pressure</em>. From the fact that there
is no shear in a static fluid it follows that the pressure stress is the
same in all directions (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F1">40-1</a>). We will let you
entertain yourself by proving that if there is no shear on any plane in
a fluid, the pressure must be the same in any direction.

<div id="Ch40-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">The pressure in a fluid may vary from place to place. For example, in
a static fluid at the earth’s surface the pressure will vary with
height because of the weight of the fluid. If the density&nbsp;$\rho$ of
the fluid is considered constant, and if the pressure at some
arbitrary zero level is called&nbsp;$p_0$ (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F2">40-2</a>), then the pressure
at a height&nbsp;$h$ above this point is&nbsp;$p=p_0-\rho gh$, where $g$ is the
gravitational force per unit mass. The combination
\begin{equation*}
p+\rho gh
\end{equation*}
is, therefore, a constant in the static fluid. This relation is
familiar to you, but we will now derive a more general result of which
it is a special case.

<p class="p">If we take a small cube of water, what is the net force on it from the
pressure? Since the pressure at any place is the same in all
directions, there can be a net force per unit volume only because the
pressure varies from one point to another. Suppose that the pressure
is varying in the $x$-direction—and we take the coordinate
directions parallel to the cube edges. The pressure on the face at&nbsp;$x$
gives the force&nbsp;$p\,\Delta y\,\Delta z$ (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F3">40-3</a>), and the
pressure on the face at&nbsp;$x+\Delta x$ gives the
force&nbsp;$-[p+(\ddpl{p}{x})\,\Delta x]\,\Delta y\,\Delta z$, so that the
resultant force is&nbsp;$-(\ddpl{p}{x})\,\Delta x\,\Delta y\,\Delta z$. If
we take the remaining pairs of faces of the cube, we easily see that
the pressure force per unit volume is&nbsp;$-\FLPgrad{p}$. If there are
other forces in addition—such as gravity—then the pressure must
balance them to give equilibrium.

<div id="Ch40-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s take a circumstance in which such an additional force can be
described by a potential energy, as would be true in the case of
gravitation; we will let $\phi$ stand for the potential energy per
unit mass. (For gravity, for instance, $\phi$ is just&nbsp;$gz$.) The force
per unit mass is given in terms of the potential by&nbsp;$-\FLPgrad{\phi}$,
and if $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, the force per unit volume
is&nbsp;$-\rho\,\FLPgrad{\phi}$. For equilibrium this force per unit volume
added to the pressure force per unit volume must give zero:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:1}
-\FLPgrad{p}-\rho\,\FLPgrad{\phi}=\FLPzero.
\end{equation}
Equation&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII401">40.1</a>) is the equation of hydrostatics. In
<em class="emph">general</em>, it <em class="emph">has no solution</em>. If the density varies in
space in an arbitrary way, there is no way for the forces to be in
balance, and the fluid cannot be in static equilibrium. Convection
currents will start up. We can see this from the equation since the
pressure term is a pure gradient, whereas for variable&nbsp;$\rho$ the
other term is not. Only when $\rho$ is a constant is the potential
term a pure gradient. Then the equation has a solution
\begin{equation*}
p+\rho\phi=\text{const}.
\end{equation*}
Another possibility which allows hydrostatic equilibrium is for&nbsp;$\rho$
to be a function only of&nbsp;$p$. However, we will leave the subject of
hydrostatics because it is not nearly so interesting as the situation
when fluids are in motion.

<span class="tag">40–2</span>The equations of motion</h3>

<div id="Ch40-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">First, we will discuss fluid motions in a purely abstract, theoretical
way and then consider special examples. To describe the motion of a
fluid, we must give its properties at every point. For example, at
different places, the water (let us call the fluid “water”) is
moving with different <em class="emph">velocities</em>. To specify the character of
the flow, therefore, we must give the three components of velocity at
every point and for any time. If we can find the equations that
determine the velocity, then we would know how the liquid moves at all
times. The velocity, however, is not the only property that the fluid
has which varies from point to point. We have just discussed the
variation of the <em class="emph">pressure</em> from point to point. And there are
still other variables. There may also be a variation of <em class="emph">density</em>
from point to point. In addition, the fluid may be a conductor and
carry an electric <em class="emph">current</em> whose density&nbsp;$\FLPj$ varies from
point to point in magnitude and direction. There may be a
<em class="emph">temperature</em> which varies from point to point, or a
<em class="emph">magnetic field</em>, and so on. So the number of fields needed to
describe the complete situation will depend on how complicated the
problem is. There are interesting phenomena when currents and
magnetism play a dominant part in determining the behavior of the
fluid; the subject is called <em class="emph">magnetohydrodynamics</em>, and great
attention is being paid to it at the present time. However, we are not
going to consider these more complicated situations because there are
already interesting phenomena at a lower level of complexity, and even
the more elementary level will be complicated enough.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch40-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We will take the situation where there is no magnetic field and no
conductivity, and we will not worry about the temperature because we
will suppose that the density and pressure determine in a unique manner
the temperature at any point. As a matter of fact, we will reduce the
complexity of our work by making the assumption that the density is a
constant—we imagine that the fluid is essentially incompressible.
Putting it another way, we are supposing that the variations of pressure
are so small that the changes in density produced thereby are
negligible. If that is not the case, we would encounter phenomena
additional to the ones we will be discussing here—for example, the
propagation of sound or of shock waves. We have already discussed the
propagation of sound and shocks to some extent, so we will now isolate
our consideration of hydrodynamics from these other phenomena by making
the approximation that the density&nbsp;$\rho$ is a constant. It is easy to
determine when the approximation of constant&nbsp;$\rho$ is a good one. We can
say that if the velocities of flow are much less than the speed of a
sound wave in the fluid, we do not have to worry about variations in
density. The escape that water makes in our attempts to understand it is
not related to the approximation of constant density. The complications
that do permit the escape will be discussed in the next chapter.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch40-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">In the general theory of fluids one must begin with an <em class="emph">equation
of state</em> for the fluid which connects the pressure to the density. In
our approximation this equation of state is simply
\begin{equation*}
\rho=\text{const}.
\end{equation*}
This then is the first relation for our variables. The next relation
expresses the conservation of matter—if matter flows away from a
point, there must be a decrease in the amount left behind. If the
fluid velocity is&nbsp;$\FLPv$, then the mass which flows in a unit time
across a unit area of surface is the component of&nbsp;$\rho\FLPv$ normal
to the surface. We have had a similar relation in electricity. We also
know from electricity that the divergence of such a quantity gives the
rate of decrease of the density per unit time. In the same way, the
equation
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:2}
\FLPdiv{(\rho\FLPv)}=-\ddp{\rho}{t}
\end{equation}
expresses the conservation of mass for a fluid; it is the hydrodynamic
<em class="emph">equation of continuity</em>. In our approximation, which is the
incompressible fluid approximation, $\rho$ is a constant, and the
equation of continuity is simply
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:3}
\FLPdiv{\FLPv}=0.
\end{equation}
The fluid velocity&nbsp;$\FLPv$—like the magnetic field&nbsp;$\FLPB$—has
zero divergence. (The hydrodynamic equations are often closely
analogous to the electrodynamic equations; that’s why we studied
electrodynamics first. Some people argue the other way; they think
that one should study hydrodynamics first so that it will be easier to
understand electricity afterwards. But electrodynamics is really much
easier than hydrodynamics.)
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch40-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We will get our next equation from Newton’s law which tells us how the
velocity changes because of the forces. The mass of an element of
volume of the fluid times its acceleration must be equal to the force
on the element. Taking an element of unit volume, and writing the
force per unit volume as&nbsp;$\FLPf$, we have
\begin{equation*}
\rho\times(\text{acceleration})=\FLPf.
\end{equation*}
We will write the force density as the sum of three terms. We have
already considered the pressure force per unit volume,
$-\FLPgrad{p}$. Then there are the “external” forces which act at a
distance—like gravity or electricity. When they are conservative
forces with a potential per unit mass, $\phi$, they give a force
density&nbsp;$-\rho\,\FLPgrad{\phi}$. (If the external forces are not
conservative, we would have to write&nbsp;$\FLPf_{\text{ext}}$ for the
external force per unit volume.) Then there is another “internal”
force per unit volume, which is due to the fact that in a
<em class="emph">flowing</em> fluid there can also be a shearing stress. This is
called the viscous force, which we will
write&nbsp;$\FLPf_{\text{visc}}$. Our equation of motion is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:4}
\rho\times(\text{acceleration})=
-\FLPgrad{p}-\rho\,\FLPgrad{\phi}+\FLPf_{\text{visc}}.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch40-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">For this chapter we are going to suppose that the liquid is “thin” in
the sense that the viscosity is unimportant, so we will
omit&nbsp;$\FLPf_{\text{visc}}$. When we drop the viscosity term, we will be
making an approximation which describes some ideal stuff rather than
real water. John von&nbsp;Neumann was
well aware of the tremendous difference between what happens when you
don’t have the viscous terms and when you do, and he was also aware
that, during most of the development of hydrodynamics until about 1900,
almost the main interest was in solving beautiful <em class="emph">mathematical</em>
problems with this approximation which had almost nothing to do with
real fluids. He characterized the theorist who made such analyses as a
man who studied “dry water.” Such analyses leave out an
<em class="emph">essential</em> property of the fluid. It is because we are leaving
this property out of our calculations in this chapter that we have given
it the title “The Flow of Dry Water.”  We are postponing a discussion
of <em class="emph">real</em> water to the next chapter.

The acceleration of a fluid particle.
</div>
</div>

<div id="Ch40-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">If we leave out $\FLPf_{\text{visc}}$, we have in Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII404">40.4</a>)
everything we need except an expression for the acceleration. You might
think that the formula for the acceleration of a fluid particle would be
very simple, for it seems obvious that if $\FLPv$ is the velocity of a
fluid particle at some place in the fluid, the acceleration would just
be&nbsp;$\ddpl{\FLPv}{t}$. <em class="emph">It is not</em>—and for a rather subtle reason.
The derivative&nbsp;$\ddpl{\FLPv}{t}$, is the rate at which the
velocity&nbsp;$\FLPv(x,y,z,t)$ changes at a <em class="emph">fixed point</em> in space. What we need
is how fast the velocity changes for a <em class="emph">particular piece</em> of fluid.
Imagine that we mark one of the drops of water with a colored speck so
we can watch it. In a small interval of time&nbsp;$\Delta t$, this drop will
move to a different location. If the drop is moving along some path as
sketched in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F4">40-4</a>, it might in&nbsp;$\Delta t$ move from
$P_1$ to&nbsp;$P_2$. In fact, it will move in the $x$-direction by an
amount&nbsp;$v_x\,\Delta t$, in the $y$-direction by the amount&nbsp;$v_y\,\Delta t$, and
in the $z$-direction by the amount&nbsp;$v_z\,\Delta t$. We see that, if
$\FLPv(x,y,z,t)$ is the velocity of the fluid particle which is
at&nbsp;$(x,y,z)$ at the time&nbsp;$t$, then the velocity of the <em class="emph">same</em>
particle, at the time&nbsp;$t+\Delta t$ is given by&nbsp;$\FLPv(x+\Delta
x,y+\Delta y,z+\Delta z,t+\Delta t)$—with
\begin{equation*}
\Delta x=v_x\,\Delta t,\quad
\Delta y=v_y\,\Delta t,\quad
\text{and}\quad
\Delta z=v_z\,\Delta t.
\end{equation*}
From the definition of the partial derivatives—recall
Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="II_02.html#mjx-eqn-EqII27">2.7</a>)—we have, to first order, that
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{align*}
\FLPv(x+\;&v_x\,\Delta t,y+v_y\,\Delta t,z+v_z\,\Delta t,t+\Delta t)\\[2pt]
&=\FLPv(x,y,z,t)+
\ddp{\FLPv}{x}\,v_x\,\Delta t+
\ddp{\FLPv}{y}\,v_y\,\Delta t+
\ddp{\FLPv}{z}\,v_z\,\Delta t+
\ddp{\FLPv}{t}\,\Delta t.

<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{gather*}

\ddp{\FLPv}{y}\,v_y\Delta t+\!
\ddp{\FLPv}{z}\,v_z\Delta t+\!
\ddp{\FLPv}{t}\,\Delta t.
\end{gather*}
</span>
The acceleration $\Delta\FLPv/\Delta t$ is
\begin{equation*}
v_x\,\ddp{\FLPv}{x}+v_y\,\ddp{\FLPv}{y}+v_z\,\ddp{\FLPv}{z}+\ddp{\FLPv}{t}.
\end{equation*}
We can write this symbolically—treating&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$ as a vector—as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:5}
(\FLPv\cdot\FLPnabla)\FLPv+\ddp{\FLPv}{t}.
\end{equation}
Note that there can be an acceleration even
though&nbsp;$\ddpl{\FLPv}{t}=\FLPzero$ so that velocity <em class="emph">at a given point</em> is
not changing. As an example, water flowing in a circle at a constant
speed is accelerating even though the velocity at a given point is not
changing. The reason is, of course, that the velocity of a particular
piece of water which is initially at one point on the circle has a
different direction a moment later; there is a centripetal
acceleration.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch40-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">The rest of our theory is just mathematical—finding solutions of the
equation of motion we get by putting the acceleration&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII405">40.5</a>)
into Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII404">40.4</a>). We get
\begin{equation}

\ddp{\FLPv}{t}+(\FLPv\cdot\FLPnabla)\FLPv=
-\frac{\FLPgrad{p}}{\rho}-\FLPgrad{\phi},
\end{equation}
where viscosity has been omitted. We can rearrange this equation by
using the following identity from vector analysis:
\begin{equation*}
(\FLPv\cdot\FLPnabla)\FLPv=(\FLPcurl{\FLPv})\times\FLPv+
\tfrac{1}{2}\FLPgrad{(\FLPv\cdot\FLPv)}.
\end{equation*}
If we now <em class="emph">define</em> a new <em class="emph">vector field</em>&nbsp;$\FLPOmega$, as the
curl of&nbsp;$\FLPv$,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:7}
\FLPOmega=\FLPcurl{\FLPv},
\end{equation}
the vector identity can be written as
\begin{equation*}
(\FLPv\cdot\FLPnabla)\FLPv=\FLPOmega\times\FLPv+
\tfrac{1}{2}\FLPgrad{v^2},
\end{equation*}
and our equation of motion&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII406">40.6</a>) becomes
\begin{equation}

\ddp{\FLPv}{t}+\FLPOmega\times\FLPv+
\frac{1}{2}\,\FLPgrad{v^2}=
-\frac{\FLPgrad{p}}{\rho}-\FLPgrad{\phi}.

You can verify that Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII406">40.6</a>)
and&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII408">40.8</a>) are equivalent by checking that the components of
the two sides of the equation are equal—and making use

<div id="Ch40-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">The vector field&nbsp;$\FLPOmega$ is called the

we say that the flow is <em class="emph">irrotational</em>. We have already defined in
Section&nbsp;<a href="II_03.html#Ch3-S5">3-5</a> a thing called the <em class="emph">circulation</em> of a
vector field. The circulation around any closed loop in a fluid is the
line integral of the fluid velocity, at a given instant of time, around
that loop:
\begin{equation*}
(\text{Circulation})=\oint\FLPv\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation*}
The circulation <em class="emph">per unit area</em> for an infinitesimal loop is
then—using Stokes’ theorem—equal to&nbsp;$\FLPcurl{\FLPv}$. So the
vorticity&nbsp;$\FLPOmega$ is the circulation around a unit area
(perpendicular to the direction of&nbsp;$\FLPOmega$). It also follows that
if you put a little piece of dirt—<em class="emph">not</em> an infinitesimal
point—at any place in the liquid it will rotate with the angular
velocity&nbsp;$\FLPOmega/2$. Try to see if you can prove that. You can also
check it out that for a bucket of water on a turntable, $\FLPOmega$ is
equal to twice the local angular velocity of the water.

<div id="Ch40-S2-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">If we are interested only in the velocity field, we can eliminate the

the curl of any gradient is zero, and using Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII403">40.3</a>), we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:9}
\ddp{\FLPOmega}{t}+\FLPcurl{(\FLPOmega\times\FLPv)}=\FLPzero.

This equation, together with the equations

\FLPOmega=\FLPcurl{\FLPv}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:11}

describes completely the velocity field&nbsp;$\FLPv$. Mathematically
speaking, if we know $\FLPOmega$ at some time, then we know the curl
of the velocity vector, and we also know that its divergence is zero,
so given the physical situation we have all we need to
determine&nbsp;$\FLPv$ everywhere. (It is just like the situation in magnetism where
we had $\FLPdiv{\FLPB}=0$ and&nbsp;$\FLPcurl{\FLPB}=\FLPj/\epsO c^2$.)
Thus, a given $\FLPOmega$ determines&nbsp;$\FLPv$ just as a given $\FLPj$
determines&nbsp;$\FLPB$. Then, knowing $\FLPv$, Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII409">40.9</a>)
tells us the rate of change of&nbsp;$\FLPOmega$ from which we can get the

again we find the new&nbsp;$\FLPv$, and so on. You see how these equations
contain all the machinery for calculating the flow. Note, however,
that this procedure gives the velocity field only; we have lost all
information about the pressure.

<p class="p">We point out one special consequence of our equation. If
$\FLPOmega=\FLPzero$ everywhere at any time&nbsp;$t$, $\ddpl{\FLPOmega}{t}$
also vanishes, so that $\FLPOmega$ is still zero everywhere

permanently irrotational. If a flow was started with zero rotation, it
would always have zero rotation. The equations to be solved then are
\begin{equation*}
\FLPdiv{\FLPv}=0,\quad
\FLPcurl{\FLPv}=\FLPzero.

They are just like the equations for the electrostatic or

steady flow we mean that at any one place in the fluid the velocity
never changes. The fluid at any point is always replaced by new fluid
moving in exactly the same way. The velocity picture always looks the
same—$\FLPv$ is a static vector field. In the same way that we drew
“field lines” in magnetostatics, we can now draw lines which are
always tangent to the fluid velocity as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F5">40-5</a>.
These lines are called <em class="emph">streamlines</em>.  For
steady flow, they are evidently the actual paths of fluid particles. (In
unsteady flow the streamline pattern changes in time, and the streamline

<p class="p">A steady flow does not mean that nothing is happening—atoms in the
fluid are moving and changing their velocities. It only means that
$\ddpl{\FLPv}{t}=\FLPzero$. Then if we take the dot product of&nbsp;$\FLPv$

term&nbsp;$\FLPv\cdot(\FLPOmega\times\FLPv)$ drops out, and we are left with

<p class="p">The theorem of Bernoulli is in fact nothing more than a statement of
the conservation of energy. A conservation theorem such as this gives
us a lot of information about a flow without our actually having to
solve the detailed equations. Bernoulli’s theorem is so important and
so simple that we would like to show you how it can be derived in a
way that is different from the formal calculations we have just
used. Imagine a bundle of adjacent streamlines which form a stream
tube as sketched in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F6">40-6</a>. Since the walls of the tube consist
of streamlines, no fluid flows out through the wall. Let’s call the
area at one end of the stream tube&nbsp;$A_1$, the fluid velocity
there&nbsp;$v_1$, the density of the fluid&nbsp;$\rho_1$, and the potential
energy&nbsp;$\phi_1$. At the other end of the tube, we have the corresponding
quantities $A_2$,&nbsp;$v_2$, $\rho_2$, and&nbsp;$\phi_2$. Now after a short
interval of time&nbsp;$\Delta t$, the fluid at&nbsp;$A_1$ has moved a
distance&nbsp;$v_1\,\Delta t$, and the fluid at&nbsp;$A_2$ has moved a
distance&nbsp;$v_2\,\Delta t$ [Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F6">40-6</a>(b)]. The conservation of <em class="emph">mass</em>
requires that the mass which enters through&nbsp;$A_1$ must be equal to the
mass which leaves through&nbsp;$A_2$. These masses at these two ends must
be the same:
\begin{equation*}
\Delta M=\rho_1A_1v_1\,\Delta t=\rho_2A_2v_2\,\Delta t.
\end{equation*}
So we have the equality
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:15}
\rho_1A_1v_1=\rho_2A_2v_2.
\end{equation}
This equation tells us that the velocity varies inversely with the
area of the stream tube if $\rho$ is constant.

<p class="p">Now we calculate the work done by the fluid pressure. The work done on
the fluid entering at&nbsp;$A_1$ is&nbsp;$p_1A_1v_1\,\Delta t$, and the work
given up at&nbsp;$A_2$ is&nbsp;$p_2A_2v_2\,\Delta t$. The net work on the fluid
between $A_1$ and&nbsp;$A_2$ is, therefore,
\begin{equation*}
p_1A_1v_1\,\Delta t-p_2A_2v_2\,\Delta t,
\end{equation*}
which must equal the increase in the energy of a mass&nbsp;$\Delta M$ of
fluid in going from $A_1$ to&nbsp;$A_2$. In other words,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:16}
p_1A_1v_1\,\Delta t-p_2A_2v_2\,\Delta t=\Delta M(E_2-E_1),
\end{equation}
where $E_1$ is the energy per unit mass of fluid at&nbsp;$A_1$, and $E_2$
is the energy per unit mass at&nbsp;$A_2$. The energy per unit mass of the
fluid can be written as
\begin{equation*}
E=\tfrac{1}{2}v^2+\phi+U,
\end{equation*}
where $\tfrac{1}{2}v^2$ is the kinetic energy per unit mass, $\phi$ is
the potential energy per unit mass, and $U$ is an additional term
which represents the internal energy per unit mass of fluid. The
internal energy might correspond, for example, to the thermal energy
in a compressible fluid, or to chemical energy. All these quantities can
vary from point to point. Using this form for the energies
in&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4016">40.16</a>), we have

But we have seen that $\Delta M=\rho Av\,\Delta t$, so we get
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}

Flow from a tank.
</div>
</div>

<div id="Ch40-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We consider now some simple examples in which the Bernoulli integral
gives us a description of the flow. Suppose we have water flowing out
of a hole near the bottom of a tank, as drawn in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F7">40-7</a>. We take
a situation in which the flow speed&nbsp;$v_{\text{out}}$ at the hole is
much larger than the flow speed near the top of the tank; in other
words, we imagine that the diameter of the tank is so large that we
can neglect the drop in the liquid level. (We could make a more
accurate calculation if we wished.) At the top of the tank the
pressure is&nbsp;$p_0$, the atmospheric pressure, and the pressure at the
sides of the jet is also&nbsp;$p_0$. Now we write our Bernoulli equation
for a streamline, such as the one shown in the figure. At the top of
the tank, we take $v$ equal to zero and we also take the gravity
potential&nbsp;$\phi$ to be zero. At the speed&nbsp;$v_{\text{out}}$, and
$\phi=-gh$, so that
\begin{equation*}
p_0=p_0+\tfrac{1}{2}\rho v_{\text{out}}^2-\rho gh,
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:18}
v_{\text{out}}=\sqrt{2gh}.
\end{equation}
This velocity is just what we would get for something which falls the
distance&nbsp;$h$.  It is not too surprising, since the water at the exit
gains kinetic energy at the expense of the potential energy of the
water at the top. Do not get the idea, however, that you can figure
out the rate that the fluid flows out of the tank by multiplying this
velocity by the area of the hole. The fluid velocities as the jet
leaves the hole are not all parallel to each other but have components
inward toward the center of the stream—the jet is converging. After
the jet has gone a little way, the contraction stops and the
velocities do become parallel. So the total flow is the velocity times
the area <em class="emph">at that point</em>. In fact, if we have a discharge opening
which is just a round hole with a sharp edge, the jet contracts to
$62$&nbsp;percent of the area of the hole.  The reduced effective area of
the discharge varies for different shapes of discharge tubes, and
experimental contractions are available as tables of <em class="emph">efflux
coefficients</em>.

<div id="Ch40-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">If the discharge tube is re-entrant, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F8">40-8</a>,
it is possible to prove in a most beautiful way that the efflux
coefficient is exactly $50$&nbsp;percent. We will give just a hint of how the
proof goes. We have used the conservation of energy to get the velocity,
Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4018">40.18</a>), but there is also momentum conservation to
consider. Since there is an outflow of momentum in the discharge jet,
there must be a force applied over the cross section of the discharge
tube. Where does the force come from? The force must come from the
pressure on the walls. As long as the efflux hole is small and away from
the walls, the fluid velocity near the walls of the tank will be very
small. Therefore, the pressure on every face is almost exactly the same
as the static pressure in a fluid at rest—from
Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4014">40.14</a>). Then the static pressure at any point on the
side of the tank must be matched by an equal pressure at the point on
the opposite wall, <em class="emph">except</em> at the points on the wall opposite the
charge tube. If we calculate the momentum poured out through the jet by
this pressure, we can show that the efflux coefficient is&nbsp;$1/2$. We
cannot use this method for a discharge hole like that shown in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F7">40-7</a>, however, because the velocity increase along the
wall right near the discharge area gives a pressure fall which we are
not able to calculate.

<div id="Ch40-S3-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s look at another example—a horizontal pipe with changing cross
section, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F9">40-9</a>, with water flowing in one end and
out the other. The conservation of energy, namely Bernoulli’s formula,
says that the pressure is lower in the constricted area where the
velocity is higher. We can easily demonstrate this effect by measuring
the pressure at different cross sections with small vertical columns
of water attached to the flow tube through holes small enough so that
they do not disturb the flow. The pressure is then measured by the
height of water in these vertical columns. The pressure is found to be
less at the constriction than it is on either side. If the area beyond
the constriction comes back to the same value it had before the
constriction, the pressure rises again. Bernoulli’s formula would
predict that the pressure downstream of the constriction should be the
same as it was upstream, but actually it is noticeably less. The
reason that our prediction is wrong is that we have neglected the
frictional, viscous forces which cause a pressure drop along the
tube. Despite this pressure drop the pressure is definitely lower at
the constriction (because of the increased speed) than it is on either
side of it—as predicted by Bernoulli. The speed&nbsp;$v_2$ must certainly
exceed&nbsp;$v_1$ to get the same amount of water through the narrower
tube. So the water accelerates in going from the wide to the narrow
part. The force that gives this acceleration comes from the drop in
pressure.

<div id="Ch40-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We saw at the beginning of the last section that if we have an
incompressible fluid with no circulation, the flow satisfies the
following two equations:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:19}
\FLPdiv{\FLPv}=0,\quad
\FLPcurl{\FLPv}=\FLPzero.
\end{equation}
They are the same as the equations of electrostatics or magnetostatics
in empty space. The divergence of the electric field is zero when
there are no charges, and the curl of the electrostatic field is
always zero. The curl of the magnetostatic field is zero if there are
no currents, and the divergence of the magnetic field is always
zero. Therefore, Eqs.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4019">40.19</a>) have the same solutions as
the equations for&nbsp;$\FLPE$ in electrostatics or for&nbsp;$\FLPB$ in
magnetostatics. As a matter of fact, we have already solved the
problem of the flow of a fluid past a sphere, as an electrostatic
analogy, in Section&nbsp;<a href="II_12.html#Ch12-S5">12-5</a>. The electrostatic analog is a
uniform electric field plus a dipole field. The dipole field is so
adjusted that the flow velocity normal to the surface of the sphere is
zero. The same problem for the flow past a cylinder can be worked out
in a similar way by using a suitable line dipole with a uniform flow
field. This solution holds for a situation in which the fluid velocity
at large distances is constant—both in magnitude and direction. The
solution is sketched in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F11">40-11</a>(a).

<p class="p">There is another solution for the flow around a cylinder when the
conditions are such that the fluid at large distances moves in circles
around the cylinder. The flow is, then, circular everywhere, as in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F11">40-11</a>(b). Such a flow has a circulation around the cylinder,
although&nbsp;$\FLPcurl{\FLPv}$ is still zero <em class="emph">in the fluid</em>. How can
there be circulation without a curl? We have a circulation around the
cylinder because the line integral of&nbsp;$\FLPv$ around any loop
<em class="emph">enclosing</em> the cylinder is not zero. At the same time, the line
integral of&nbsp;$\FLPv$ around any closed path which does <em class="emph">not</em>
include the cylinder is zero. We saw the same thing when we found the
magnetic field around a wire. The curl of&nbsp;$\FLPB$ was zero outside of
the wire, although a line integral of&nbsp;$\FLPB$ around a path which
encloses the wire did not vanish. The velocity field in an
irrotational circulation around a cylinder is precisely the same as
the magnetic field around a wire. For a circular path with its center
at the center of the cylinder, the line integral of the velocity is
\begin{equation*}
\oint\FLPv\cdot d\FLPs=2\pi rv.
\end{equation*}
For irrotational flow the integral must be independent of&nbsp;$r$. Let’s
call the constant value&nbsp;$C$, then we have that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:40:20}
v=\frac{C}{2\pi r},

as&nbsp;$1/r$—it’s just from the conservation of angular momentum, like the
skater pulling in her arms. Also the radial velocity goes as&nbsp;$1/r$.
Ignoring the tangential motion, we have water going radially
inward toward a hole; from $\FLPdiv{\FLPv}=0$, it follows that the
radial velocity is proportional to&nbsp;$1/r$. So the total velocity also
increases as&nbsp;$1/r$, and the water goes in along Archimedean
spirals. The air-water surface is all at atmospheric pressure, so it

\begin{equation*}
gz+\tfrac{1}{2}v^2=\text{const}.

<p class="p">An interesting point—which <em class="emph">is not true in general</em> but is true
for incompressible, irrotational flow—is that if we have one solution
and a second solution, then the sum is also a solution. This is true
because the equations in&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4019">40.19</a>) are linear. The complete
equations of hydrodynamics, Eqs.
(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII409">40.9</a>),&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4010">40.10</a>), and&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4011">40.11</a>), are
not linear, which makes a vast difference. For the irrotational flow
about the cylinder, however, we can superpose the flow of
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F11">40-11</a>(a) on the flow of Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F11">40-11</a>(b) and
get the new flow pattern shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F11">40-11</a>(c). This flow
is of special interest. The flow velocity is higher on the upper side of
the cylinder than on the lower side. The pressures are therefore
<em class="emph">lower</em> on the <em class="emph">upper</em> side than on the lower side. So when we
have a combination of a circulation around a cylinder <em class="emph">and</em> a net

<div id="Ch40-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We have already written down the general equations for the flow of an
incompressible fluid when there may be vorticity. They are
\begin{align*}

\text{III.}&\quad\ddp{\FLPOmega}{t}+

The physical content of these equations has been described in words by
Helmholtz in terms of three
theorems. First, imagine that in the fluid we were to draw <em class="emph">vortex
lines</em> rather than streamlines. By vortex lines we mean field lines that
have the direction of&nbsp;$\FLPOmega$ and have a density in any region
proportional to the magnitude of&nbsp;$\FLPOmega$. From&nbsp;II the divergence
of&nbsp;$\FLPOmega$ is <em class="emph">always</em> zero
(remember—Section&nbsp;<a href="II_03.html#Ch3-S7">3-7</a>—that the divergence of a curl
is always zero). So vortex lines are like lines of&nbsp;$\FLPB$—they never
start or stop, and will tend to go in closed loops. Now
Helmholtz described&nbsp;III in
words by the following statement: the vortex lines <em class="emph">move with the
fluid</em>. This means that if you were to mark the fluid particles along
some vortex lines—by coloring them with ink, for example—then as the
fluid moves and carries those particles along, they will always mark the
new positions of the vortex lines. In whatever way the atoms of the
liquid move, the vortex lines move with them. That is one way to
describe the laws.

<div id="Ch40-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">It also suggests a method for solving any problems. Given the initial
flow pattern—say&nbsp;$\FLPv$ everywhere—then you can
calculate&nbsp;$\FLPOmega$. From the&nbsp;$\FLPv$ you can also tell where the
vortex lines are going to be a little later—they move with the
speed&nbsp;$\FLPv$. With the new&nbsp;$\FLPOmega$ you can use I and&nbsp;II to find the
new&nbsp;$\FLPv$. (That’s just like the problem of finding&nbsp;$\FLPB$, given the
currents.) If we are given the flow pattern at one instant we can in
principle calculate it for all subsequent times. We have the general
solution for nonviscous flow.

<p class="p">We would like to show how Helmholtz’s statement—and, therefore, III—can
be at least partly understood. It is really just the law of conservation
of angular momentum applied to the fluid. Suppose we imagine a small
cylinder of the liquid whose axis is parallel to the vortex lines, as in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F13">40-13</a>(a). At some time later, this <em class="emph">same</em> piece
of fluid will be somewhere else. Generally it will occupy a cylinder
with a different diameter and be in a different place. It may also have
a different orientation, say as in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F13">40-13</a>(b). If,
however, the diameter has decreased as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F13">40-13</a>,
the length will have increased to keep the volume constant (since we are
assuming an incompressible fluid). Also, since the vortex lines are
stuck with the material, their density will go up as the cross-sectional
area goes down. The product of the vorticity&nbsp;$\FLPOmega$ and area&nbsp;$A$ of
the cylinder will remain constant, so according to
Helmholtz, we should have

with no <em class="emph">tangential</em> forces the magnitude of the <em class="emph">angular

times the angular velocity of the liquid, which is proportional to the
vorticity&nbsp;$\Omega$. For a cylinder, the moment of inertia is
proportional to&nbsp;$mr^2$. So from the conservation of angular momentum,
we would conclude that
\begin{equation*}
(M_1R_1^2)\,\Omega_1=(M_2R_2^2)\,\Omega_2.
\end{equation*}
But the mass is the same, $M_1=M_2$, and the areas are proportional
to&nbsp;$R^2$, so we get again just Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII4021">40.21</a>). Helmholtz’s
statement—which is equivalent to&nbsp;III—is just a consequence of the fact
that in the absence of viscosity the angular momentum of an element of
the fluid cannot change.

Making a travelling vortex ring.

<p class="p">There is a nice demonstration of a moving vortex which is made with
the simple apparatus of Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F14">40-14</a>. It is a “drum” two feet in
diameter and two feet long made by stretching a thick rubber sheet
over the open end of a cylindrical “box.” The “bottom”—the drum
is tipped on its side—is solid except for a $3$-inch diameter
hole. If you give a sharp blow on the rubber diaphragm with your hand,
a vortex ring is projected out of the hole. Although the vortex is
invisible, you can tell it’s there because it will blow out a candle
$10$ to $20$&nbsp;feet away. By the delay in the effect, you can tell that
“something” is travelling at a finite speed. You can see better what
is going on if you first blow some smoke into the box. Then you see
the vortex as a beautiful round “smoke ring.”

<div id="Ch40-S5-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">The smoke ring is a torus-shaped bundle of vortex lines, as shown in 
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F15">40-15(a)</a>. 
Since $\FLPOmega=\FLPcurl{\FLPv}$, these vortex lines
represent also a circulation of&nbsp;$\FLPv$ as shown in part (b) of the
figure. We can understand the forward motion of the ring in the
following way: The circulating velocity around the <em class="emph">bottom</em> of
the ring extends up to the top of the ring, having there a forward
motion. Since the lines of&nbsp;$\FLPOmega$ move with the fluid, they also
move ahead with the velocity&nbsp;$\FLPv$. (Of course, the circulation
of&nbsp;$\FLPv$ around the top part of the ring is responsible for the forward
motion of the vortex lines at the bottom.)

<div id="Ch40-S5-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">We must now mention a serious difficulty. We have already noted that
Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII409">40.9</a>) says that, if $\FLPOmega$ is initially zero,
it will always be zero. This result is a great failure of the theory
of “dry” water, because it means that once $\FLPOmega$ is zero it is
<em class="emph">always</em> zero—it is impossible to <em class="emph">produce</em> any vorticity
under any circumstance.  Yet, in our simple demonstration with the
drum, we can generate a vortex ring starting with air which was
initially at rest. (Certainly, $\FLPv=\FLPzero$, $\FLPOmega=\FLPzero$
everywhere in the box before we hit it.) Also, we all know that we can
start some vorticity in a lake with a paddle. Clearly, we must go to a
theory of “wet” water to get a complete understanding of the
behavior of a fluid.

</div>

<div id="Ch40-S5-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Another feature of the dry water theory which is incorrect is the
supposition we make regarding the flow at the boundary between it and
the surface of a solid.  When we discussed the flow past a
cylinder—as in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch40-F11">40-11</a>, for example—we permitted the fluid to
slide along the surface of the solid. In our theory, the velocity at a
solid surface could have any value depending on how it got started,
and we did not consider any “friction” between the fluid and the
solid. It is an experimental fact, however, that the velocity of a
real fluid always goes to zero at the surface of a solid
object. Therefore, our solution for the cylinder, with or without
circulation, is wrong—as is our result regarding the generation of
vorticity. We will tell you about the more correct theories in the
next chapter.
