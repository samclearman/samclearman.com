the scalar potential&nbsp;$\phi$, and the three space components are the
vector potential&nbsp;$\FLPA$. We also worked out the potentials of a
particle moving with uniform speed on a straight line by using the
Lorentz transformation. (We had already found them by another method in
Chapter&nbsp;<a href="II_21.html">21</a>.) For a point charge whose position at the
time&nbsp;$t$ is&nbsp;$(vt,0,0)$, the potentials at the point&nbsp;$(x,y,z)$ are
\begin{equation}

the position <em class="emph">at the time</em>&nbsp;$t$) is at&nbsp;$x=vt$. Notice that the
equations are in terms of $(x-vt)$,&nbsp;$y$, and&nbsp;$z$ which are the
coordinates measured <em class="emph">from the current position</em>&nbsp;$P$ of the moving

the retarded time). But we said that the charge was moving with uniform
velocity in a straight line, so naturally the behavior at&nbsp;$P'$ and the
current position are directly related. In fact, if we make the added

a <em class="emph">complete</em> formula for the potentials for a charge moving

in some arbitrary fashion, say with the trajectory in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch26-F2">26–2</a>, and you are trying to find the potentials at the
point&nbsp;$(x,y,z)$. First, you find the retarded position&nbsp;$P'$ and the
velocity&nbsp;$v'$ at that point. Then you imagine that the charge would keep
on moving with this velocity during the delay time&nbsp;$(t'-t)$, so that it
would then appear at an imaginary position&nbsp;$P_{\text{proj}}$, which we
can call the “projected position,” and would arrive there with the
velocity&nbsp;$v'$. (Of course, it doesn’t do that; its real position at&nbsp;$t$
is at&nbsp;$P$.) Then the potentials at&nbsp;$(x,y,z)$ are just what
equations&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII261">26.1</a>) would give for the imaginary charge at the
projected position&nbsp;$P_{\text{proj}}$. What we are saying is that since
the potentials depend only on what the charge is doing at the
<em class="emph">retarded</em> time, the potentials will be the same whether the charge
continued moving at a constant velocity or whether it changed its
velocity after&nbsp;$t'$—that is, after the potentials that were going to
appear at&nbsp;$(x,y,z)$ at the time&nbsp;$t$ were already determined.

the only things that count? Better yet, why is it that the potentials
depend only on the position and the velocity and not, for instance, on
the acceleration? The <em class="emph">fields</em> $\FLPE$ and&nbsp;$\FLPB$ <em class="emph">do</em>
depend on the acceleration. If you try to make the same kind of an

the path but also on the acceleration. So there are several additional
tacit assumptions in this great statement that everything can be
deduced from the Lorentz transformation. (Whenever you see a sweeping

of assumptions, you always find that it is false. There are usually a
large number of implied assumptions that are far from obvious if you

<div id="Ch26-S2-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now that we have the potentials from a point charge moving at constant
velocity, we ought to find the fields—for practical reasons. There
are many cases where we have uniformly moving particles—for
instance, cosmic rays going through a cloud chamber, or even
slow-moving electrons in a wire. So let’s at least see what the fields
actually do look like for any speed—even for speeds nearly that of
light—assuming only that there is no acceleration. It is an
interesting question.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch26-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We get the fields from the potentials by the usual rules:
\begin{equation*}
\FLPE=-\FLPgrad{\phi}-\ddp{\FLPA}{t},\quad
\FLPB=\FLPcurl{\FLPA}.
\end{equation*}
First, for $E_z$
\begin{equation*}
E_z=-\ddp{\phi}{z}-\ddp{A_z}{t}.
\end{equation*}
But $A_z$ is zero; so differentiating $\phi$ in
equations&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII261">26.1</a>), we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:2}
E_z\!=\!\frac{q}{\overset{\phantom [}4\pi\epsO\sqrt{1\!-\!v^2}}
\frac{z}{\biggl[\!
\dfrac{(x\!-\!vt)^2}{1\!-\!v^2}\!+\!y^2\!+\!z^2
\!\biggr]^{3/2}}.
\end{equation}
Similarly, for $E_y$,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:3}
E_y\!=\!\frac{q}{\overset{\phantom [}4\pi\epsO\sqrt{1\!-\!v^2}}
\frac{y}{\biggl[\!
\dfrac{(x\!-\!vt)^2}{1\!-\!v^2}\!+\!y^2\!+\!z^2
\!\biggr]^{3/2}}.
\end{equation}
The $x$-component is a little more work. The derivative of&nbsp;$\phi$ is
more complicated and&nbsp;$A_x$ is not zero. First,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:4}
-\ddp{\phi}{x}\!=\!\frac{q}{\overset{\phantom [}4\pi\epsO\sqrt{1\!-\!v^2}}
\frac{(x\!-\!vt)/(1\!-\!v^2)}{\biggl[\!
\dfrac{(x\!-\!vt)^2}{1\!-\!v^2}\!+\!y^2\!+\!z^2
\!\biggr]^{3/2}}.
\end{equation}
Then, differentiating&nbsp;$A_x$ with respect to&nbsp;$t$, we find
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:5}
-\ddp{A_x}{t}\!=\!\frac{q}{\overset{\phantom [}4\pi\epsO\sqrt{1\!-\!v^2}}
\frac{-v^2(x\!-\!vt)/(1\!-\!v^2)}{\biggl[\!
\dfrac{(x\!-\!vt)^2}{1\!-\!v^2}\!+\!y^2\!+\!z^2
\!\biggr]^{3/2}}.
\end{equation}
And finally, taking the sum,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:6}
E_x\!=\!\frac{q}{\overset{\phantom [}4\pi\epsO\sqrt{1\!-\!v^2}}
\frac{x\!-\!vt}{\biggl[\!

find&nbsp;$\FLPB$. For the $z$-component,
\begin{equation*}
B_z=\ddp{A_y}{x}-\ddp{A_x}{y}.
\end{equation*}
Since $A_y$ is zero, we have just one derivative to get. Notice,
however, that $A_x$ is just $v\phi$, and $\ddpl{}{y}$ of&nbsp;$v\phi$ is
just $-vE_y$. So
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:7}
B_z=vE_y.

Similarly,
\begin{equation*}
B_y=\ddp{A_x}{z}-\ddp{A_z}{x}=+v\,\ddp{\phi}{z},

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:8}
B_y=-vE_z.

Finally, $B_x$ is zero, since $A_y$ and&nbsp;$A_z$ are both zero. We can

<p class="p">Now let’s see what the fields look like. We will try to draw a picture
of the field at various positions around the present position of the
charge. It is true that the influence of the charge comes, in a
certain sense, from the retarded position; but because the motion is
exactly specified, the retarded position is uniquely given in terms of
the present position. For uniform velocities, it’s nicer to relate the
fields to the current position, because the field components
at&nbsp;$(x,y,z)$ depend only on $(x - vt)$,&nbsp;$y$, and&nbsp;$z$—which are the
components of the displacement&nbsp;$\FLPr$ from the present position
to&nbsp;$(x,y,z)$ (see Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch26-F3">26–3</a>).

<p class="p">Consider first a point with $z=0$. Then $\FLPE$ has only $x$- and

ratio of these components is just equal to the ratio of the $x$- and
$y$-components of the displacement. That means that $\FLPE$ is in <em class="emph">the same
direction</em> as&nbsp;$\FLPr$, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch26-F3">26–3</a>. Since $E_z$ is also
proportional to&nbsp;$z$, it is clear that this result holds in three dimensions. In
short, the electric field is radial from the charge, and the field lines radiate
directly out of the charge, just as they do for a stationary charge. Of course,
the field isn’t exactly the same as for the stationary charge, because of all
the extra factors of&nbsp;$(1-v^2)$. But we can show something rather interesting.
The difference is just what you would get if you were to draw the Coulomb field
with a peculiar set of coordinates in which the scale of&nbsp;$x$ was squashed up by
the factor&nbsp;$\sqrt{1-v^2}$. If you do that, the field lines will be spread out
ahead and behind the charge and will be squeezed together around the sides, as

<p class="p">If we relate the strength of&nbsp;$\FLPE$ to the density of the field lines
in the conventional way, we see a stronger field at the sides and a
weaker field ahead and behind, which is just what the equations
say. First, if we look at the strength of the field at right angles to
the line of motion, that is, for&nbsp;$(x-vt)=0$, the distance from the
charge is&nbsp;$\sqrt{y^2+z^2}$. Here the total field strength
is&nbsp;$\sqrt{E_y^2+E_z^2}$, which is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:10}
E=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsO\sqrt{1-v^2}}\,
\frac{1}{y^2+z^2}.
\end{equation}
The field is proportional to the inverse square of the distance—just
like the Coulomb field except increased by the constant, extra
factor&nbsp;$1/\sqrt{1-v^2}$, which is always greater than one. So at the
<em class="emph">sides</em> of a moving charge, the electric field is stronger than
you get from the Coulomb law. In fact, the field in the sidewise
direction is bigger than the Coulomb potential by the ratio of the
energy of the particle to its rest mass.

\end{equation}
The field again varies as the inverse square of the distance from the
charge but is now <em class="emph">reduced</em> by the factor&nbsp;$(1-v^2)$, in agreement
with the picture of the field lines. If $v/c$ is small, $v^2/c^2$ is
still smaller, and the effect of the $(1-v^2)$&nbsp;terms is very small; we
get back to Coulomb’s law. But if a particle is moving very close to
the speed of light, the field in the forward direction is enormously
reduced, and the field in the sidewise direction is enormously
increased.

</div>

<div id="Ch26-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Our results for the electric field of a charge can be put this way:
Suppose you were to draw on a piece of paper the field lines for a
charge at rest, and then set the picture to travelling with the
speed&nbsp;$v$. Then, of course, the whole picture would be compressed by the
Lorentz contraction; that is, the carbon granules on the paper would
appear in different places. The miracle of it is that the picture you
would see as the page flies by would still represent the field lines
of the point charge. The contraction moves them closer together at the
sides and spreads them out ahead and behind, just in the right way to
give the correct line densities. We have emphasized before that field
lines are not real but are only one way of representing the
field. However, here they almost seem to be real. In this particular
case, if you make the mistake of thinking that the field lines are
somehow really there in space, and transform them, you get the correct
field. That doesn’t, however, make the field lines any more real. All
you need do to remind yourself that they aren’t real is to think about
the electric fields produced by a charge together with a magnet; when
the magnet moves, new electric fields are produced, and destroy the
beautiful picture. So the neat idea of the contracting picture doesn’t
work in general. It is, however, a handy way to remember what the
fields from a fast-moving charge are like.

a&nbsp;$\FLPB$ which circles around the line of motion, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch26-F5">26–5</a>. If we put back the&nbsp;$c$’s, you will see that it’s
the same result we had for low-velocity charges. A good way to see where
the&nbsp;$c$’s must go is to refer back to the force law,
\begin{equation*}
\FLPF=q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB).
\end{equation*}
You see that a velocity times the magnetic field has the same dimensions
as an electric field. So the right-hand side of Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII269">26.9</a>)
must have a factor&nbsp;$1/c^2$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:12}
\FLPB=\frac{\FLPv\times\FLPE}{c^2}.

For a slow-moving charge ($v\ll c$), we can take for $\FLPE$ the
Coulomb field; then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:13}
\FLPB=\frac{q}{4\pi\epsO c^2}\,
\frac{\FLPv\times\FLPr}{r^3}.

in spite of the arguments given earlier that there is physical meaning
and reality to the potentials. The fields, too, are real. It would be
convenient for many purposes to have a way to compute the fields in a
moving system if you already know the fields in some “rest”
system. We have the transformation laws for $\phi$ and&nbsp;$\FLPA$,
because $A_\mu$ is a four-vector. Now we would like to know the
transformation laws of $\FLPE$ and&nbsp;$\FLPB$. Given $\FLPE$ and&nbsp;$\FLPB$
in one frame, how do they look in another frame moving past? It is a
convenient transformation to have. We could always work back through
the potentials, but it is useful sometimes to be able to transform the
fields directly. We will now see how that goes.

<p class="p">How can we find the transformation laws of the fields? We know the
transformation laws of the $\phi$ and&nbsp;$\FLPA$, and we know how the

that with every vector there should be something to make it a
four-vector, so with $\FLPE$ there’s got to be something else we can
use for the fourth component. And also for&nbsp;$\FLPB$. But it’s not
so. It’s quite different from what you would expect.)  To begin with,
let’s take just a magnetic field&nbsp;$\FLPB$, which is, of course
$\FLPcurl{\FLPA}$. Now we know that the vector potential with its
$x$-, $y$-, and $z$-components is only a piece of something; there is
also a $t$-component. Also we know that for derivatives
like&nbsp;$\FLPnabla$, besides the $x$, $y$, $z$ parts, there is also a
derivative with respect to&nbsp;$t$. So let’s try to figure out what
happens if we replace a&nbsp;“$y$” by a&nbsp;“$t$”, or a&nbsp;“$z$” by
a&nbsp;“$t$,” or something like that.

The $x$-component is equal to a couple of terms that involve only $y$-

$F_{zy}$. We simply mean that

F_{zy}\equiv\ddp{A_z}{y}-\ddp{A_y}{z}.

\ddp{\phi}{z}-\ddp{A_z}{t}.
\end{equation*}
You’ve seen that before. It is the $z$-component of&nbsp;$\FLPE$. Well,
almost—there is a sign wrong. But we forgot that in the
four-dimensional gradient the $t$-derivative comes with the opposite
sign from $x$,&nbsp;$y$, and&nbsp;$z$. So we should really have taken the more
consistent extension of&nbsp;$F_{tz}$, as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:17}
F_{tz}=\ddp{A_t}{z}+\ddp{A_z}{t}
\end{equation}
Then it is exactly equal to&nbsp;$-E_z$. Trying also $F_{tx}$ and&nbsp;$F_{ty}$,
we find that the three possibilities give
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:18}
F_{tx}=-E_x,\quad
F_{ty}=-E_y,\quad
F_{tz}=-E_z.

<p class="p">You see that what we have done here is to generalize the cross
product. We began with the curl operation, and the fact that the
transformation properties of the curl are the same as the
transformation properties of <em class="emph">two</em> vectors—the ordinary
three-dimensional vector&nbsp;$\FLPA$ and the gradient operator which we
know also behaves like a vector. Let’s look for a moment at an
ordinary cross product in three dimensions, for example, the angular
momentum of a particle. When an object is moving in a plane, the
quantity&nbsp;$(xv_y-yv_x)$ is important. For motion in three dimensions,
there are three such important quantities, which we call the angular
momentum:
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation*}
L_{xy}=m(xv_y-yv_x),\quad
L_{yz}=m(yv_z-zv_y),\quad
L_{zx}=m(zv_x-xv_z).

Then (although you may have forgotten by now) we discovered in
Chapter&nbsp;<a href="I_20.html">20</a> of Vol.&nbsp;I the miracle that these three
quantities could be identified with the components of a vector. In order
to do so, we had to make an artificial rule with a right-hand
convention. It was just luck. It was luck because&nbsp;$L_{ij}$ (with $i$
and&nbsp;$j$ equal to $x$,&nbsp;$y$, or&nbsp;$z$) was an antisymmetric object:
\begin{equation*}
L_{ij}=-L_{ji},\quad
L_{ii}=0.
\end{equation*}
Of the nine possible quantities, there are only three independent
numbers. And it just happens that when you change coordinate systems
these three objects transform in exactly the same way as the
components of a vector.

along&nbsp;$z$ or along&nbsp;$t$?

that is evidently impossible, because there are six independent terms,
and you can’t represent six things by four things.

various possible combinations of components, like $a_xb_x$, $a_xb_y$,
etc. There would be nine possible quantities:

&a_xb_x,&\quad&a_xb_y,&\quad&a_xb_z,\\
&a_yb_x,&\quad&a_yb_y,&\quad&a_yb_z,\\

just the way a product of vectors transforms. For&nbsp;$F_{\mu\nu}$ it
happens that if you change the indices around, $F_{\mu\nu}$ changes

transformation of&nbsp;$\nabla\!_\mu A_\nu-\nabla\!_\nu A_\mu$.
Since&nbsp;$\fournabla$ is just a special case of a vector, we will work with the
general antisymmetric vector combination, which we can call&nbsp;$G_{\mu\nu}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:20}
G_{\mu\nu}=a_\mu b_\nu-a_\nu b_\mu.
\end{equation}
(For our purposes, $a_\mu$ will eventually be replaced by&nbsp;$\fournabla$
and $b_\mu$ will be replaced by the potential&nbsp;$A_\mu$.) The components
of $a_\mu$ and&nbsp;$b_\mu$ transform by the Lorentz formulas, which are
\begin{equation}

<div id="Ch26-S3-p18" class="para">

But that is just $G_{tx}$; so we have the simple result
\begin{equation*}
G_{tx}'=G_{tx}.

<div id="Ch26-S3-p19" class="para">
<p class="p">We will do one more.

So we get that

G_{ty}'=\frac{G_{ty}-vG_{xy}}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}.

And, of course, in the same way,
\begin{equation*}
G_{tz}'=\frac{G_{tz}-vG_{xz}}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}.

It is clear how the rest will go. Let’s make a table of all six terms;

<p class="p">The transformation of Table&nbsp;<a href="#Ch26-T2">26–2</a> gives us an interesting
and simple answer for what we see if we move past <em class="emph">any</em> system of
fixed charges. For example, suppose we want to know the fields in
<em class="emph">our</em> frame&nbsp;$S'$ if we are moving along between the plates of a
condenser, as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch26-F7">26–7</a>. (It is, of course, the same thing
if we say that a charged condenser is moving past <em class="emph">us</em>.) What do
we see?  The transformation is easy in this case because the
$\FLPB$-field in the original system is zero. Suppose, first, that our
motion is perpendicular to&nbsp;$\FLPE$; then we will see
an&nbsp;$\FLPE'=\FLPE/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ which is still completely
transverse. We will see, in addition, a magnetic
field&nbsp;$\FLPB'=-\FLPv\times\FLPE'/c^2$. (The $\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ doesn’t
appear in our formula for&nbsp;$\FLPB'$ because we wrote it in terms
of&nbsp;$\FLPE'$ rather than&nbsp;$\FLPE$; but it&#39;s the same thing.) So when we 
move along perpendicular to a static electric field, we see an added transverse&nbsp;$\FLPB$. If our motion is not
perpendicular to&nbsp;$\FLPE$, we break $\FLPE$ into $\FLPE_\parallel$
and&nbsp;$\FLPE_\perp$. The parallel part is unchanged,
$E_\parallel'=E_\parallel$, and the perpendicular component does as
just described.

<p class="p">Let’s take the opposite case, and imagine we are moving through a pure
static <em class="emph">magnetic</em> field. This time we would see an
<em class="emph">electric</em> field&nbsp;$\FLPE'$ equal to&nbsp;$\FLPv\times\FLPB'$, and the
magnetic field changed by the factor&nbsp;$1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ (assuming it
is transverse). So long as&nbsp;$v$ is much less than&nbsp;$c$, we can neglect
the change in the magnetic field, and the main effect is that an
electric field appears. As one example of this effect, consider this
once famous problem of determining the speed of an airplane. It’s no
longer famous, since radar can now be used to determine the air speed
from ground reflections, but for many years it was very hard to find
the speed of an airplane in bad weather. You could not see the ground
and you didn’t know which way was up, and so on. Yet it was important
to know how fast you were moving relative to the earth. How can this
be done without seeing the earth? Many who knew the transformation
formulas thought of the idea of using the fact that the airplane moves
in the magnetic field of the earth. Suppose that an airplane is flying
where there is a magnetic field more or less known. Let’s just take
the simple case where the magnetic field is vertical. If we were
flying through it with a horizontal velocity&nbsp;$\FLPv$, then, according to
our formula, we should see an electric field which
is&nbsp;$\FLPv\times\FLPB$, i.e., perpendicular to the line of motion. If we
hang an insulated wire across the airplane, this electric field will
induce charges on the ends of the wire. That is nothing new. From the
point of view of someone on the ground, we are moving a wire through a
field, and the&nbsp;$\FLPv\times\FLPB$ force causes charges to move to the
ends of the wire. The transformation equations just say the same thing
in a different way. (The fact that we can say the thing more than one
way doesn’t mean that one way is better than another. We are getting
so many different methods and tools that we can usually get the same
result in $65$&nbsp;different ways!)

<div id="Ch26-S3-p27" class="para">
<p class="p">So to measure&nbsp;$v$, all we have to do is measure the voltage between
the ends of the wire. We can’t do it with a voltmeter because the same
fields will act on the wires in the voltmeter, but there are ways of
measuring such fields. We talked about some of them when we discussed
atmospheric electricity in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="II_09.html">9</a>. So it should be
possible to measure the speed of the airplane.

</div>

<div id="Ch26-S3-p28" class="para">
<p class="p">This important problem was, however, never solved this way. The reason
is that the electric field that is developed is of the order of
millivolts per meter. It is possible to measure such fields, but the
trouble is that these fields are, unfortunately, not any different
from any other electric fields. The field that is produced by motion
through the magnetic field can’t be distinguished from some electric
field that was already in the air from another cause, say from
electrostatic charges in the air, or on the clouds. We described in
Chapter&nbsp;<a href="II_09.html">9</a> that there are, typically, electric fields
above the surface of the earth with strengths of about $100$&nbsp;volts per
meter. But they are quite irregular. So as the airplane flies through
the air, it sees fluctuations of atmospheric electric fields which are
enormous in comparison to the tiny fields produced by the
$\FLPv\times\FLPB$&nbsp;term, and it turns out for practical reasons to be
impossible to measure speeds of an airplane by its motion through the
earth’s magnetic field.

<p class="p">It doesn’t do much good to find electric and magnetic fields from
Maxwell’s equations unless we
know what the fields do when we have them. You may remember that the
fields are required to find the forces on charges, and that those forces
determine the motion of the charge. So, of course, part of the theory of
electrodynamics is the relation between the motion of charges and the
forces.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch26-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">For a single charge in the fields $\FLPE$ and&nbsp;$\FLPB$, the force is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:23}
\FLPF=q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB).
\end{equation}
This force is equal to the mass times the acceleration for low
velocities, but the correct law for any velocity is that the force is
equal to&nbsp;$d\FLPp/dt$. Writing $\FLPp=m_0\FLPv/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$, we
find that the relativistically correct equation of motion is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:24}
\ddt{}{t}\biggl(\frac{m_0\FLPv}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\biggr)=
\FLPF=q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB).
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch26-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We would like now to discuss this equation from the point of view of
relativity. Since we have put our Maxwell equations in relativistic form, it
would be interesting to see what the equations of motion would look like
in relativistic form. Let’s see whether we can rewrite the equation in a
four-vector notation.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch26-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We know that the momentum is part of a four-vector&nbsp;$p_\mu$ whose time
component is the energy&nbsp;$m_0c^2/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$. So we might think to
replace the left-hand side of Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2624">26.24</a>)
by&nbsp;$dp_\mu/dt$. Then we need only find a fourth component to go
with&nbsp;$\FLPF$. This fourth component must equal the rate-of-change of the
energy, or the rate of doing work, which is&nbsp;$\FLPF\cdot\FLPv$. We
would then like to write the right-hand side of Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2624">26.24</a>)
as a four-vector like&nbsp;$(\FLPF\cdot\FLPv,F_x,F_y,F_z)$. But this does not
make a four-vector.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch26-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">The <em class="emph">time</em> derivative of a four-vector is no longer a
four-vector, because the&nbsp;$d/dt$ requires the choice of some special
frame for measuring&nbsp;$t$. We got into that trouble before when we tried
to make&nbsp;$\FLPv$ into a four-vector. Our first guess was that the time
component would be&nbsp;$cdt/dt=c$. But the quantities
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:25}
\biggl(c,\ddt{x}{t},\ddt{y}{t},\ddt{z}{t}\biggl)=(c,\FLPv)
\end{equation}
are <em class="emph">not</em> the components of a four-vector. We found that they
could be made into one by multiplying each component
by&nbsp;$1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$. The “four-velocity”&nbsp;$u_\mu$ is the four-vector
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:26}
u_\mu=\biggl(\frac{c}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}},
\frac{\FLPv}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\biggr).
\end{equation}
So it appears that the trick is to multiply $d/dt$
by&nbsp;$1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$, if we want the derivatives to make a
four-vector.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch26-S4-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Our second guess then is that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:27}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\,\ddt{}{t}(p_\mu)
\end{equation}
should be a four-vector. But what is $\FLPv$? It is the velocity of
the particle—not of a coordinate frame! Then the quantity&nbsp;$f_\mu$
defined by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:28}
f_\mu=\biggl(\frac{\FLPF\cdot\FLPv}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}},
\frac{\FLPF}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\biggr)
\end{equation}
is the extension into four dimensions of a force—we can call it the
“four-force.” It is indeed a four-vector, and its space components
are not the components of&nbsp;$\FLPF$ but of&nbsp;$\FLPF/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch26-S4-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">The question is—why is&nbsp;$f_\mu$ a four-vector? It would be nice to
get a little understanding of that $1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$&nbsp;factor. Since
it has come up twice now, it is time to see why the&nbsp;$d/dt$ can always
be fixed by the same factor. The answer is in the following: When we
take the time derivative of some function&nbsp;$x$, we compute the
increment&nbsp;$\Delta x$ in a small interval&nbsp;$\Delta t$ in the
variable&nbsp;$t$. But in another frame, the interval&nbsp;$\Delta t$ might correspond to
a change in both $t'$ and&nbsp;$x'$, so if we vary only&nbsp;$t'$, the change
in&nbsp;$x$ will be different. We have to find a variable for our
differentiation that is a measure of an “interval” in
<em class="emph">space-time</em>, which will then be the same in all
coordinate systems. When we take&nbsp;$\Delta x$ for that interval, it will
be the same for all coordinate frames. When a particle “moves” in
four-space, there are the changes $\Delta t$,&nbsp;$\Delta x$, $\Delta
y$,&nbsp;$\Delta z$. Can we make an invariant interval out of them? Well,
they are the components of the four-vector&nbsp;$x_\mu=(ct,x,y,z)$ so if we
define a quantity&nbsp;$\Delta s$ by
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:29}
(\Delta s)^2=\frac{1}{c^2}\,\Delta x_\mu\Delta x_\mu=\frac{1}{c^2}
(c^2\Delta t^2-\Delta x^2-\Delta y^2-\Delta z^2)
\end{equation}
</span>
<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{align}
\label{Eq:II:26:29}
(\Delta s)^2&=\frac{1}{c^2}\,\Delta x_\mu\Delta x_\mu\\[1ex]
&=\frac{1}{c^2}(c^2\Delta t^2-\Delta x^2-\Delta y^2-\Delta z^2)\notag
\end{align}
</span>
—which is a four-dimensional dot product—we then have a good
four-scalar to use as a measure of a four-dimensional interval. From
$\Delta s$—or its limit&nbsp;$ds$—we can define a parameter&nbsp;$s=\int
ds$. And a derivative with respect to&nbsp;$s$, $d/ds$, is a nice
four-dimensional operation, because it is invariant with respect to a
Lorentz transformation.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch26-S4-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">It is easy to relate $ds$ to&nbsp;$dt$ for a moving particle. For a moving
point particle,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:30}

<div id="Ch26-S4-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">So the operator 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\,\ddt{}{t}

is an <em class="emph">invariant operator</em>. If we operate on any four-vector with
it, we get another four-vector. For instance, if we operate
on&nbsp;$(ct,x,y,z)$, we get the four-velocity&nbsp;$u_\mu$:
\begin{equation*}
\ddt{x_\mu}{s}=u_\mu.
\end{equation*}
We see now why the factor&nbsp;$\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ fixes things up.

<div id="Ch26-S4-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">The invariant variable&nbsp;$s$ is a useful physical quantity. It is called
the “proper time” along the path of a particle, because&nbsp;$ds$ is
always an interval of time in a frame that is moving with the particle
at any particular instant. (Then, $\Delta x=$ $\Delta y=$ $\Delta z=$ $0$, and
$\Delta s=\Delta t$.) If you can imagine some “clock” whose rate
doesn’t depend on the acceleration, such a clock carried along with
the particle would show the time&nbsp;$s$.

<div id="Ch26-S4-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">We can now go back and write Newton’s law (as corrected by
Einstein)
in the neat form
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:32}
\ddt{p_\mu}{s}=f_\mu,
\end{equation}
where $f_\mu$ is given in Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2628">26.28</a>). Also, the
momentum&nbsp;$p_\mu$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:33}
p_\mu=m_0u_\mu=m_0\,\ddt{x_\mu}{s},
\end{equation}
where the coordinates&nbsp;$x_\mu=(ct,x,y,z)$ now describe the trajectory
of the particle. Finally, the four-dimensional notation gives us this
very simple form of the equations of motion:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:34}
f_\mu=m_0\,\frac{d^2x_\mu}{ds^2},
\end{equation}
which is reminiscent of&nbsp;$F=ma$. It is important to notice that
Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2634">26.34</a>) is <em class="emph">not</em> the same as&nbsp;$F=ma$, because the
four-vector formula Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2634">26.34</a>) has in it the relativistic
mechanics which are different from Newton’s law for high velocities. It
is unlike the case of Maxwell’s
equations, where we were able to
rewrite the equations in the relativistic form <em class="emph">without any change
in the meaning at all</em>—but with just a change of notation.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch26-S4-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let’s return to Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2624">26.24</a>) and see how we can write
the right-hand side in four-vector notation. The three

of&nbsp;$f_\mu$, so
<span class="eq-wide">

Now we must put all quantities in their relativistic notation. First,
$c/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ and $v_y/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ and
$v_z/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ are the $t$-,&nbsp;$y$-, and&nbsp;$z$-components of the
four-velocity&nbsp;$u_\mu$. And the components of $\FLPE$ and&nbsp;$\FLPB$ are
components of the second-rank tensor of the
fields&nbsp;$F_{\mu\nu}$. Looking back in Table&nbsp;<a href="#Ch26-T1">26–1</a> for the
components of&nbsp;$F_{\mu\nu}$ that correspond to $E_x$,&nbsp;$B_z$, and&nbsp;$B_y$,
we get<a name="footnote_source_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup class="mark">3</sup></a>
\begin{equation*}
f_x=q(u_tF_{xt}-u_yF_{xy}-u_zF_{xz}),
\end{equation*}
which begins to look interesting. Every term has the subscript&nbsp;$x$,
which is reasonable, since we’re finding an&nbsp;$x$-component. Then all
the others appear in pairs: $tt$, $yy$, $zz$—except that the
$xx$-term is missing. So we just stick it in, and write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:36}
f_x=q(u_tF_{xt}-u_xF_{xx}-u_yF_{xy}-u_zF_{xz}).
\end{equation}
We haven’t changed anything because $F_{\mu\nu}$ is antisymmetric, and
$F_{xx}$ is zero. The reason for wanting to put in the $xx$-term is so
that we can write Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2636">26.36</a>) in the short-hand form
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:37}
f_\mu=qu_\nu F_{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}
This equation is the same as Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2636">26.36</a>) if we make the
<em class="emph">rule</em> that whenever any subscript occurs <em class="emph">twice</em> (as&nbsp;$\nu$
does here), you automatically sum over terms in the same way as for
the scalar product, <em class="emph">using the same convention for the signs</em>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch26-S4-p13" class="para">
<p class="p">You can easily believe that&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2637">26.37</a>) works equally well for
$\mu=y$ or&nbsp;$\mu=z$, but what about&nbsp;$\mu=t$? Let’s see, for fun, what
it says:
\begin{equation*}
f_t=q(u_tF_{tt}-u_xF_{tx}-u_yF_{ty}-u_zF_{tz}).
\end{equation*}
Now we have to translate back to $E$’s and&nbsp;$B$’s. We get
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:26:38}
f_t=q\biggl(0+
\frac{v_x}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\,E_x+

\end{equation}
</span>
or
\begin{equation*}
f_t=\frac{q\FLPv\cdot\FLPE}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}.
\end{equation*}
But from Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2628">26.28</a>), $f_t$ is supposed to be
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\FLPF\cdot\FLPv}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}=
\frac{q(\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB)\cdot\FLPv}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}.
\end{equation*}
This is the same thing as Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2638">26.38</a>), since
$(\FLPv\times\FLPB)\cdot\FLPv$ is zero. So everything comes out all
right.
</p>

<div id="Ch26-S4-p14" class="para">
<p class="p">Summarizing, our equation of motion can be written in the elegant form
\begin{equation}

m_0\,\frac{d^2x_\mu}{ds^2}=f_\mu=qu_\nu F_{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}
Although it is nice to see that the equations can be written that way,
this form is not particularly useful. It’s usually more convenient to
solve for particle motions by using the original
equations&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2624">26.24</a>), and that’s what we will usually do.
