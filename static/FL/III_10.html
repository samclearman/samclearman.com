molecule under the approximation that it can be considered as a

system—there are many states of rotation, vibration, translation, and
so on—but each of these states of motion must be analyzed in terms of
two internal states because of the flip-flop of the nitrogen atom. Here
we are going to consider other examples of systems which, to some
approximation or other, can be considered as two-state systems. Lots of
things will be approximate because there are always many other states,
and in a more accurate analysis they would have to be taken into
account. But in each of our examples we will be able to understand a
great deal by just thinking about two states.

<p class="p">Since we will only be dealing with two-state systems, the Hamiltonian we
need will look just like the one we used in the last chapter. When the

<p class="p">Now we will use these results to discuss a number of interesting
examples taken from the fields of chemistry and physics. The first
example is the hydrogen molecular ion. A positively ionized hydrogen
molecule consists of two protons with one electron worming its way
around them. If the two protons are very far apart, what states would
we expect for this system? The answer is pretty clear: The electron
will stay close to one proton and form a hydrogen atom in its lowest
state, and the other proton will remain alone as a positive ion. So,
if the two protons are far apart, we can visualize one physical state
in which the electron is “attached” to one of the protons. There is,
clearly, another state symmetric to that one in which the electron is
near the other proton, and the first proton is the one that is an
ion. We will take these two as our base states, and we’ll call them
$\ket{\slOne}$ and $\ket{\slTwo}$. They are sketched in
Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F1">10–1</a>. Of course, there are really many states of an
electron near a proton, because the combination can exist as any one of
the excited states of the hydrogen atom. We are not interested in that
variety of states now; we will consider only the situation in which the
hydrogen atom is in the lowest state—its ground state—and we will,
for the moment, disregard spin of the electron. We can just suppose that
for all our states the electron has its spin “up” along the
$z$-axis.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a></p>

<p class="p">Now to remove an electron from a hydrogen atom requires
$13.6$ electron volts of energy. So long as the two protons of the hydrogen
molecular ion are far apart, it still requires about this much
energy—which is for our present considerations a great deal of
energy—to get the electron somewhere near the midpoint between the
protons. So it is impossible, classically, for the electron to jump
from one proton to the other. However, in quantum mechanics it is
possible—though not very likely. There is some small amplitude for
the electron to move from one proton to the other. As a first
approximation, then, each of our base states $\ket{\slOne}$
and $\ket{\slTwo}$ will have the energy $E_0$, which is just the energy
of one hydrogen atom plus one proton. We can take that the Hamiltonian
matrix elements $H_{11}$ and $H_{22}$ are both approximately
equal to $E_0$. The other matrix elements $H_{12}$
and $H_{21}$, which are the amplitudes for the electron to go back and
forth, we will again write as $-A$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">You see that this is the same game we played in the last two
chapters. If we disregard the fact that the electron can flip back and
forth, we have two states of exactly the same energy. This energy
will, however, be split into two energy levels by the possibility of
the electron going back and forth—the greater the probability of the
transition, the greater the split. So the two energy levels of the
system are $E_0+A$ and $E_0-A$; and the states which have these
definite energies are given by Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII107">10.7</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">From our solution we see that if a proton and a hydrogen atom are put
anywhere near together, the electron will not stay on one of the
protons but will flip back and forth between the two protons. If it
starts on one of the protons, it will oscillate back and forth between
the states $\ket{\slOne}$ and $\ket{\slTwo}$—giving a time-varying
solution. In order to have the lowest energy solution (which does not
vary with time), it is necessary to start the system with equal
amplitudes for the electron to be around each proton. Remember, there
are not two electrons—we are not saying that there is an electron
around each proton. There is only <em class="emph">one</em> electron, and <em class="emph">it</em>
has the same amplitude—$1/\sqrt{2}$ in magnitude—to be in either
position.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Now the amplitude $A$ for an electron which is near one proton to get to
the other one depends on the separation between the protons. The closer
the protons are together, the larger the amplitude. You remember that we
talked in Chapter <a href="III_07.html">7</a> about the amplitude for an electron
to “penetrate a barrier,” which it could not do classically. We have
the same situation here. The amplitude for an electron to get across
decreases roughly exponentially with the distance—for large distances.
Since the transition probability, and therefore $A$, gets larger when
the protons are closer together, the separation of the energy levels
will also get larger. If the system is in the state $\ket{\slI}$, the
energy $E_0+A$ increases with decreasing distance, so these quantum
mechanical effects make a <em class="emph">repulsive</em> force tending to keep the
protons apart. On the other hand, if the system is in the
state $\ket{\slII}$, the total energy <em class="emph">decreases</em> if the protons
are brought closer together; there is an <em class="emph">attractive</em> force pulling
the protons together. The variation of the two energies with the
distance between the two protons should be roughly as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F2">10–2</a>. We have, then, a quantum-mechanical explanation
of the binding force that holds the $\text{H}_2^+$ ion together.</p>

<p class="p">We have, however, forgotten one thing. In addition to the force we have
just described, there is also an electrostatic repulsive force between
the two protons. When the two protons are far apart—as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F1">10–1</a>—the “bare” proton sees only a neutral atom,
so there is a negligible electrostatic force. At very close distances,
however, the “bare” proton begins to get “inside” the electron
distribution—that is, it is closer to the proton on the average than
to the electron. So there begins to be some extra electrostatic energy
which is, of course, positive. This energy—which also varies with the
separation—should be included in $E_0$. So for $E_0$ we should take
something like the broken-line curve in Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F2">10–2</a> which
rises rapidly for distances less than the radius of a hydrogen atom. We
should add and subtract the flip-flop energy $A$ from this $E_0$. When
we do that, the energies $E_{\slI}$ and $E_{\slII}$ will vary with the
interproton distance $D$ as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F3">10–3</a>. [In this
figure, we have plotted the results of a more detailed calculation. The
interproton distance is given in units of $1$ Å ($10^{-8}$ cm), and
the excess energy over a proton plus a hydrogen atom is given in units
of the binding energy of the hydrogen atom—the so-called “Rydberg”
energy, $13.6$ eV.]
We see that the state $\ket{\slII}$ has a minimum-energy point. This
will be the equilibrium configuration—the lowest energy
condition—for the $\text{H}_2^+$ ion. The energy at this point is lower than
the energy of a separated proton and hydrogen ion, so the system is
bound. A single electron acts to hold the two protons together. A
chemist would call it a “one-electron bond.”

<p class="p">This kind of chemical binding is also often called “quantum mechanical
resonance” (by analogy with the two coupled pendulums we have
described before). But that really sounds more mysterious than it is,
it’s only a “resonance” if you start out by making a poor choice for
your base states—as we did also! If you picked the
state $\ket{\slII}$, you would have the lowest energy state—that’s all.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S1-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">We can see in another way why such a state should have a lower energy
than a proton and a hydrogen atom. Let’s think about an electron near
two protons with some fixed, but not too large, separation. You
remember that with a single proton the electron is “spread out”
because of the uncertainty principle. It seeks a balance between
having a low Coulomb <em class="emph">potential</em> energy and not getting confined
into too small a space, which would make a high <em class="emph">kinetic</em> energy
(because of the uncertainty relation $\Delta p\,\Delta
x\approx\hbar$). Now if there are two protons, there is more space
where the electron can have a low potential energy. It can spread
out—lowering its kinetic energy—without increasing its potential
energy. The net result is a lower energy than a proton and a hydrogen
atom. Then why does the other state $\ket{\slI}$ have a higher energy?
Notice that this state is the <em class="emph">difference</em> of the states
$\ket{\slOne}$ and $\ket{\slTwo}$. Because of the symmetry of
$\ket{\slOne}$ and $\ket{\slTwo}$, the difference must have zero
amplitude to find the electron half-way between the two protons. This
means that the electron is somewhat more confined, which leads to a
larger energy.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S1-p13" class="para">
<p class="p">We should say that our approximate treatment of the $\text{H}_2^+$ ion as a
two-state system breaks down pretty badly once the protons get as
close together as they are at the minimum in the curve of
Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F3">10–3</a>, and so, will not give a good value for the
actual binding energy. For small separations, the energies of the two
“states” we imagined in Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F1">10–1</a> are not really equal
to $E_0$; a more refined quantum mechanical treatment is needed.</p>

<p class="p">Suppose we ask now what would happen if instead of two protons, we had
two different objects—as, for example, one proton and one lithium
positive ion (both particles still with a single positive charge). In
such a case, the two terms $H_{11}$ and $H_{22}$ of the Hamiltonian
would no longer be equal; they would, in fact, be quite different. If it
should happen that the difference $(H_{11}-H_{22})$ is, in absolute
value, much greater than $A=-H_{12}$, the attractive force gets very
weak, as we can see in the following way.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S1-p15" class="para">
<p class="p">If we put $H_{12}H_{21}=A^2$ into Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII103">10.3</a>) we get

\frac{H_{11}-H_{22}}{2}
\sqrt{1+\frac{4A^2}{(H_{11}-H_{22})^2}}.
\end{equation*}

When $H_{11}-H_{22}$ is much greater than $A^2$, the square root is
very nearly equal to
\begin{equation*}
1+\frac{2A^2}{(H_{11}-H_{22})^2}.

The two energies are then\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:8}

\frac{A^2}{(H_{11}-H_{22})},\\[1ex]
E_{\slII}&=H_{22}-
\frac{A^2}{(H_{11}-H_{22})}.

no longer equal to $2A$; it is smaller by the
factor $A/(H_{11}-H_{22})$, which we are now taking to be much less than
one. Also, the dependence of $E_{\slI}-E_{\slII}$ on the separation of
the two nuclei is much smaller than for the $\text{H}_2^+$ ion—it is also
reduced by the factor $A/(H_{11}-H_{22})$. We can now see why the

<div id="Ch10-S1-p17" class="para">
<p class="p">In our theory of the $\text{H}_2^+$ ion we have discovered an explanation for
the mechanism by which an electron shared by two protons provides, in
effect, an attractive force between the two protons which can be
present even when the protons are at large distances. The attractive
force comes from the reduced energy of the system due to the
possibility of the electron jumping from one proton to the other. In
such a jump the system changes from the configuration (hydrogen atom,
proton) to the configuration (proton, hydrogen atom), or switches
back. We can write the process symbolically as
\begin{equation*}
(H,p)\rightleftharpoons (p,H).
\end{equation*}

The energy shift due to this process is proportional to the
amplitude $A$ that an electron whose energy is $-W_H$ (its binding
energy in the hydrogen atom) can get from one proton to the other.</p>

<div id="Ch10-S1-p18" class="para">
<p class="p">For large distances $R$ between the two protons, the electrostatic
potential energy of the electron is nearly zero over most of the space

<em class="emph">negative</em> energy! We have seen in Chapter <a href="III_03.html">3</a>
[Eq. (<a href="III_03.html#mjx-eqn-EqIII37">3.7</a>)] that the amplitude for a particle of
definite energy to get from one place to another a distance $r$ away

\begin{equation*}
\frac{e^{(i/\hbar)pr}}{r},

where $p$ is the momentum corresponding to the definite energy. In the
present case (using the nonrelativistic formula), $p$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:9}
\frac{p^2}{2m}=-W_H.

This means that $p$ is an imaginary number,
\begin{equation*}

force pulling the two protons together which is proportional—for
large $R$—to the derivative of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1010">10.10</a>) with respect
to $R$.</p>

<p class="p">Finally, to be complete, we should remark that in the two-proton,
one-electron system there is still one other effect which gives a
dependence of the energy on $R$.  We have neglected it until now because
it is usually rather unimportant—the exception is just for those very
large distances where the energy of the exchange term $A$ has decreased
exponentially to very small values. The new effect we are thinking of is
the electrostatic attraction of the proton for the hydrogen atom, which
comes about in the same way any charged object attracts a neutral
object.  The bare proton makes an electric field $\Efield$ (varying
as $1/R^2$) at the neutral hydrogen atom. The atom becomes polarized,
taking on an induced dipole moment $\mu$ proportional to $\Efield$. The
energy of the dipole is $\mu\Efield$, which is proportional
to $\Efield^2$—or to $1/R^4$. So there is a term in the energy of the
system which decreases with the fourth power of the distance. (It is a
correction to $E_0$.) This energy falls off with distance more slowly
than the shift $A$ given by (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1010">10.10</a>); at some large
separation $R$ it becomes the only remaining important term giving a
variation of energy with $R$—and, therefore, the only remaining force.
Note that the electrostatic term has the same sign for both of the base
states (the force is attractive, so the energy is negative) and so also
for the two stationary states, whereas the electron exchange term $A$
gives opposite signs for the two stationary states.</p>

<p class="p">We have seen that the system of a hydrogen atom and a proton has an

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:11}
\frac{e^{-\alpha R}}{R},

with $\alpha=\sqrt{2mW_H}/\hbar$. (One usually says that there is an
exchange of a “virtual” electron when—as here—the electron has
to jump across a space where it would have a negative energy. More
specifically, a “virtual exchange” means that the phenomenon
involves a quantum mechanical interference between an exchanged state
and a nonexchanged state.)</p>

<div id="Ch10-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we might ask the following question: Could it be that forces
between other kinds of particles have an analogous origin? What about,
for example, the nuclear force between a neutron and a proton, or
between two protons? In an attempt to explain the nature of nuclear
forces, Yukawa
proposed that the force between two nucleons is due to
a similar exchange effect—only, in this case, due to the virtual
exchange, not of an electron, but of a new particle, which he called a
“meson.” Today, we would identify Yukawa’s meson with the
$\pi$-meson (or “pion”) produced in high-energy collisions of
protons or other particles.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s see, as an example, what kind of a force we would expect from
the exchange of a positive pion ($\pi^+$) of mass $m_\pi$ between a
proton and a neutron. Just as a hydrogen atom H$^0$ can go into a
proton p$^+$ by giving up an electron e$^-$,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:12}
\text{H}^0\to\text{p}^++\text{e}^-,

a proton p$^+$ can go into a neutron n$^0$ by giving up a
$\pi^+$ meson:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:13}
\text{p}^+\to\text{n}^0+\pi^+.

So if we have a proton at $a$ and a neutron at $b$ separated by the
distance $R$, the proton can become a neutron by emitting a $\pi^+$,
which is then absorbed by the neutron at $b$, turning it into a
proton. There is an energy of interaction of the two-nucleon (plus
pion) system which depends on the amplitude $A$ for the pion

we get for the nuclear case an exchange amplitude $A$ which
should—for large $R$—go as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:14}
\frac{e^{-(m_\pi c/\hbar)R}}{R}.
\end{equation}

The interaction energy is proportional to $A$, and so varies in the same
way. We get an energy variation in the form of the so-called
<em class="emph">Yukawa potential</em> between two nucleons. Incidentally, we
obtained this same formula earlier directly from the differential
equation for the motion of a pion in free space [see

basic process is now
\begin{equation}

\text{p}^+\to\text{p}^++\pi^0.

A proton can emit a virtual $\pi^0$, but then it remains still a
proton. If we have two protons, proton No. $1$ can emit a virtual
$\pi^0$ which is absorbed by proton No. $2$. At the end, we still
have two protons. This is somewhat different from the $\text{H}_2^+$
ion. There the H$^0$ went into a different condition—the
proton—after emitting the electron. Now we are assuming that a
proton can emit a $\pi^0$ without changing its character. Such
processes are, in fact, observed in high-energy collisions. The
process is analogous to the way that an electron emits a photon and
ends up still an electron:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:16}
\text{e}\to\text{e}+\text{photon}.

<p class="p">Going back to the two protons, there is an interaction energy which
arises from the amplitude $A$ that one proton emits a neutral pion

is absorbed there. This amplitude is again proportional
to (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1014">10.14</a>), with $m_\pi$ the mass of the neutral pion. All
the same arguments give an equal interaction energy for two neutrons.
Since the nuclear forces (disregarding electrical effects) between
neutron and proton, between proton and proton, between neutron and
neutron are the same, we conclude that the masses of the charged and
neutral pions should be the same. Experimentally, the masses are indeed
very nearly equal, and the small difference is about what one would
expect from electric self-energy corrections (see

and lead to terms in the exchange amplitude which vary as
\begin{equation*}
\frac{e^{-(m_xc/\hbar)R}}{R}.
\end{equation*}

These terms die out faster with increasing $R$ than the one-meson
term. No one knows, today, how to calculate these higher-mass terms,
but for large enough values of $R$ only the one-pion term

the classical electromagnetic fields in a box. Alternatively, the
quantum theory can be set up by describing light in terms of
particles—photons—which obey Bose statistics. We emphasized in

<span class="tag">10–3</span>The hydrogen molecule</h3>
<div id="Ch10-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">As our next two-state system we will look at the neutral hydrogen
molecule H$_2$. It is, naturally, more complicated to understand because
it has two electrons. Again, we start by thinking of what happens when
the two protons are well separated. Only now we have two electrons to
add. To keep track of them, we’ll call one of them “electron $a$” and
the other “electron $b$.” We can again imagine two possible states.
One possibility is that “electron $a$” is around the first proton and
“electron $b$” is around the second, as shown in the top half of
Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F4">10–4</a>. We have simply two hydrogen atoms. We will call
this state $\ket{\slOne}$. There is also another possibility: that
“electron $b$” is around the first proton and that “electron $a$” is
around the second. We call this state $\ket{\slTwo}$. From the symmetry
of the situation, those two possibilities should be energetically
equivalent, but, as we will see, the energy of the system is <em class="emph">not</em>
just the energy of two hydrogen atoms. We should mention that there are
many other possibilities. For instance, “electron $a$” might be near
the first proton and “electron $b$” might be in another state around
the <em class="emph">same</em> proton. We’ll disregard such a case, since it will
certainly have higher energy (because of the large Coulomb repulsion
between the two electrons). For greater accuracy, we would have to
include such states, but we can get the essentials of the molecular
binding by considering just the two states of Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F4">10–4</a>.
To this approximation we can describe any state by giving the
amplitude $\braket{\slOne}{\phi}$ to be in the state $\ket{\slOne}$ and
an amplitude $\braket{\slTwo}{\phi}$ to be in state $\ket{\slTwo}$. In
other words, the state vector $\ket{\phi}$ can be written as the linear
combination
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\phi}=\sum_i\ket{i}\braket{i}{\phi}.

<p class="p">To proceed, we assume—as usual—that there is some amplitude $A$
that the electrons can move through the intervening space and exchange
places. This possibility of exchange means that the energy of the
system is split, as we have seen for other two-state systems. As for
the hydrogen molecular ion, the splitting is very small when the
distance between the protons is large. As the protons approach each
other, the amplitude for the electrons to go back and forth increases,
so the splitting increases. The decrease of the lower energy state
means that there is an attractive force which pulls the atoms
together. Again the energy levels rise when the protons get very close
together because of the Coulomb repulsion. The net final result is
that the two stationary states have energies which vary with the
separation as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F5">10–5</a>. At a separation of
about $0.74$ Å, the lower energy level reaches a minimum; this is the
proton-proton distance of the true hydrogen molecule.</p>

<p class="p">Now you have probably been thinking of an objection. What about the
fact that the two electrons are identical particles? We have been
calling them “electron $a$” and “electron $b$,” but there really
is no way to tell which is which. And we have said in
Chapter <a href="III_04.html">4</a> that for electrons—which are Fermi
particles—if there are two ways something can happen by exchanging the
electrons, the two amplitudes will interfere with a <em class="emph">negative</em>
sign. This means that if we switch which electron is which, the sign of
the amplitude must reverse. We have just concluded, however, that the
bound state of the hydrogen molecule would be (at $t=0$)
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\slII}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,(\ket{\slOne}+\ket{\slTwo}).
\end{equation*}

However, according to our rules of Chapter <a href="III_04.html">4</a>, this
state is not allowed. If we reverse which electron is which, we get
the state
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,(\ket{\slTwo}+\ket{\slOne}).
\end{equation*}

and we get the same sign instead of the opposite one.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S3-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">These arguments are correct <em class="emph">if both electrons have the same
spin</em>. It is true that if both electrons have spin up (or both have
spin down), the only state that is permitted is
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\slI}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,(\ket{\slOne}-\ket{\slTwo}).
\end{equation*}

For this state, an interchange of the two electrons gives
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,(\ket{\slTwo}-\ket{\slOne}).
\end{equation*}

which is $-\ket{\slI}$, as required. So if we bring two hydrogen atoms
near to each other with their electrons spinning in the same direction,
they can go into the state $\ket{\slI}$ and not state $\ket{\slII}$. But
notice that state $\ket{\slI}$ is the <em class="emph">upper</em> energy state. Its
curve of energy versus separation has no minimum. The two hydrogens will
always repel and will not form a molecule. So we conclude that the
hydrogen molecule cannot exist with parallel electron spins. And that is
right.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">On the other hand, our state $\ket{\slII}$ is perfectly symmetric for
the two electrons. In fact, if we interchange which electron we call $a$
and which we call $b$ we get back exactly the same state. We saw in
Section <a href="III_04.html#Ch4-S7">4–7</a> that if two Fermi particles are in the same
state, they <em class="emph">must</em> have opposite spins. So, the bound hydrogen
molecule must have one electron with spin up and one with spin down.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">The whole story of the hydrogen molecule is really somewhat more
complicated if we want to include the proton spins. It is then no longer
right to think of the molecule as a <em class="emph">two</em>-state system. It should
really be looked at as an <em class="emph">eight</em>-state system—there are four
possible spin arrangements for each of our states $\ket{\slOne}$
and $\ket{\slTwo}$—so we were cutting things a little short by
neglecting the spins. Our final conclusions are, however, correct.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S3-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">We find that the lowest energy state—the only bound state—of the
H$_2$ molecule has the two electrons with spins opposite. The total
spin angular momentum of the electrons is zero. On the other hand, two
nearby hydrogen atoms with spins parallel—and so with a total
angular momentum $\hbar$—must be in a higher (unbound) energy state;
the atoms repel each other. There is an interesting correlation
between the spins and the energies. It gives another illustration of
something we mentioned before, which is that there appears to be an
“interaction” energy between two spins because the case of parallel
spins has a higher energy than the opposite case. In a certain sense
you could say that the spins try to reach an antiparallel condition
and, in doing so, have the potential to liberate energy—not because
there is a large magnetic force, but because of the exclusion
principle.</p>

<div id="Ch10-S3-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">We saw in Section <a href="#Ch10-S1">10–1</a> that the binding of two
<em class="emph">different</em> ions by a <em class="emph">single</em> electron is likely to be
quite weak. This is <em class="emph">not</em> true for binding by <em class="emph">two</em>
electrons. Suppose the two protons in Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F4">10–4</a> were
replaced by any two ions (with closed inner electron shells and a single
ionic charge), and that the binding energies of an electron at the two
ions are different. The energies of states $\ket{\slOne}$
and $\ket{\slTwo}$ would still be equal because in each of these states we
have one electron bound to each ion. Therefore, we always have the
splitting proportional to $A$. Two-electron binding is ubiquitous—it
is the most common valence bond. Chemical binding usually involves this
flip-flop game played by two electrons. Although two atoms can be bound
together by only one electron, it is relatively rare—because it
requires just the right conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S3-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Finally, we want to mention that if the energy of attraction for an
electron to one nucleus is much greater than to the other, then what
we have said earlier about ignoring other possible states is no longer
right. Suppose nucleus $a$ (or it may be a positive ion) has a much
stronger attraction for an electron than does nucleus $b$. It may then
happen that the total energy is still fairly low even when both
electrons are at nucleus $a$, and no electron is at nucleus $b$. The
strong attraction may more than compensate for the mutual repulsion of
the two electrons. If it does, the lowest energy state may have a
large amplitude to find both electrons at $a$ (making a negative ion)
and a small amplitude to find any electron at $b$. The state looks
like a negative ion with a positive ion. This is, in fact, what
happens in an “ionic” molecule like NaCl. You can see that all the
gradations between covalent binding and ionic binding are possible.</p>

<p class="p">Chemists have invented nice diagrams to represent complicated organic
molecules. Now we are going to discuss one of the most interesting of
them—the benzene molecule shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F6">10–6</a>. It
contains six carbon and six hydrogen atoms in a symmetrical array. Each
bar of the diagram represents a <em class="emph">pair</em> of electrons, with spins
opposite, doing the covalent bond dance. Each hydrogen atom contributes
one electron and each carbon atom contributes four electrons to make up
the total of $30$ electrons involved. (There are two more electrons
close to the nucleus of the carbon which form the first, or K, shell.
These are not shown since they are so tightly bound that they are not
appreciably involved in the covalent binding.) So each bar in the figure
represents a <em class="emph">bond</em>, or pair of electrons, and the double bonds
mean that there are <em class="emph">two pairs</em> of electrons between alternate
pairs of carbon atoms.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">There is a mystery about this benzene molecule. We can calculate what
energy should be required to form this chemical compound, because the
chemists have measured the energies of various compounds which involve
pieces of the ring—for instance, they know the energy of a double
bond by studying ethylene, and so on. We can, therefore, calculate the
total energy we should expect for the benzene molecule. The actual
energy of the benzene ring, however, is much lower than we get by such
a calculation; it is more tightly bound than we would expect from what
is called an “unsaturated double bond system.” Usually a double bond
system which is not in such a ring is easily attacked chemically
because it has a relatively high energy—the double bonds can be
easily broken by the addition of other hydrogens. But in benzene the
ring is quite permanent and hard to break up.  In other words, benzene
has a much lower energy than you would calculate from the bond
picture.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Then there is another mystery. Suppose we replace two adjacent
hydrogens by bromine atoms to make ortho-dibromobenzene. There are two
ways to do this, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F7">10–7</a>. The bromines
could be on the opposite ends of a double bond as shown in part (a) of
the figure, or could be on the opposite ends of a single bond as in (b).

<p class="p">Now we want to resolve these mysteries—and perhaps you have already
guessed how: by noticing, of course, that the “ground state” of the
benzene ring is really a two-state system. We could imagine that the
bonds in benzene could be in either of the two arrangements shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F8">10–8</a>. You say, “But they are really the same; they
should have the same energy.” Indeed, they should. And for that reason
they must be analyzed as a two-state system. Each state represents a
different configuration of the whole set of electrons, and there is some
amplitude $A$ that the whole bunch can switch from one arrangement to
the other—there is a chance that the electrons can flip from one dance
to the other.</p>

<p class="p">As we have seen, this chance of flipping makes a mixed state whose
energy is lower than you would calculate by looking separately at either
of the two pictures in Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F8">10–8</a>. Instead, there are two
stationary states—one with an energy above and one with an energy
below the expected value. So actually, the true normal state (lowest
energy) of benzene is neither of the possibilities shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F8">10–8</a>, but it has the amplitude $1/\sqrt{2}$ to be in
each of the states shown. It is the only state that is involved in the
chemistry of benzene at normal temperatures. Incidentally, the upper
state also exists; we can tell it is there because benzene has a strong
absorption for ultraviolet light at the
frequency $\omega=(E_{\slI}-E_{\slII})/\hbar$. You will remember that in
ammonia, where the object flipping back and forth was three protons, the
energy separation was in the microwave region. In benzene, the objects
are electrons, and because they are much lighter, they find it easier to
flip back and forth, which makes the coefficient $A$ very much larger.
The result is that the energy difference is much larger—about
$3$ eV, which is the energy of an ultraviolet photon.<a name="footnote_source_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup class="mark">3</sup></a></p>

<div id="Ch10-S4-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">What happens if we substitute bromine? Again the two “possibilities”
(a) and (b) in Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F7">10–7</a> represent the two different
electron configurations. The only difference is that the two base states
we start with would have slightly different energies. The lowest energy
stationary state will still involve a linear combination of the two
states, but with unequal amplitudes. The amplitude for
state $\ket{\slOne}$ might have a value something like $\sqrt{2/3}$,
say, whereas state $\ket{\slTwo}$ would have the magnitude $\sqrt{1/3}$.
We can’t say for sure without more information, but once the two
energies $H_{11}$ and $H_{22}$ are no longer equal, then the amplitudes
$C_1$ and $C_2$ no longer have equal magnitudes. This means, of course,
that one of the two possibilities in the figure is more likely than the
other, but the electrons are mobile enough so that there is some
amplitude for both. The other state has different amplitudes (like
$\sqrt{1/3}$ and $-\sqrt{2/3}$) but lies at a higher energy. There is
only one lowest state, not two as the naive theory of fixed chemical

<p class="p">We will give you one more chemical example of the two-state
phenomenon—this time on a larger molecular scale. It has to do with
the theory of dyes. Many dyes—in fact, most artificial dyes—have an
interesting characteristic; they have a kind of symmetry.
Figure <a href="#Ch10-F9">10–9</a> shows an ion of a particular dye called
magenta, which has a purplish red color. The molecule has
three ring structures—two of which are benzene rings. The third is not
exactly the same as a benzene ring because it has only two double bonds
inside the ring. The figure shows two equally satisfactory pictures, and
we would guess that they should have equal energies. But there is a
certain amplitude that all the electrons can flip from one condition to
the other, shifting the position of the “unfilled” position to the
opposite end. With so many electrons involved, the flipping amplitude is
somewhat lower than it is in the case of benzene, and the difference in
energy between the two stationary states is smaller. There are,
nevertheless, the usual two stationary states $\ket{\slI}$
and $\ket{\slII}$ which are the sum and difference combinations of the two
base states shown in the figure. The energy separation of $\ket{\slI}$
and $\ket{\slII}$ comes out to be equal to the energy of a photon in the
optical region. If one shines light on the molecule, there is a very
strong absorption at one frequency, and it appears to be brightly
colored. That’s why it’s a dye!</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Another interesting feature of such a dye molecule is that in the two
base states shown, the center of electric charge is located at different
places. As a result, the molecule should be strongly affected by an
external electric field. We had a similar effect in the ammonia
molecule. Evidently we can analyze it by using exactly the same
mathematics, provided we know the numbers $E_0$ and $A$. Generally,
these are obtained by gathering experimental data. If one makes
measurements with many dyes, it is often possible to guess what will
happen with some related dye molecule. Because of the large shift in the
position of the center of electric charge the value of $\mu$ in
formula (<a href="III_09.html#mjx-eqn-EqIII955">9.55</a>) is large and the material has a high
probability for absorbing light of the characteristic
frequency $2A/\hbar$. Therefore, it is not only colored but very
strongly so—a small amount of substance absorbs a lot of light.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">The rate of flipping—and, therefore, $A$—is very sensitive to the
complete structure of the molecule. By changing $A$, the energy
splitting, and with it the color of the dye, can be changed. Also, the
molecules do not have to be perfectly symmetrical. We have seen that
the same basic phenomenon exists with slight modifications, even if
there is some small asymmetry present. So, one can get some
modification of the colors by introducing slight asymmetries in the
molecules. For example, another important dye, malachite green, is
very similar to magenta, but has two of the hydrogens replaced by
CH$_3$. It’s a different color because the $A$ is shifted and the
flip-flop rate is changed.</p>

\begin{equation}

specifically, we want to assume that if two magnetic fields are
superposed, the terms in the Hamiltonian simply add—if we know
the $H_{ij}$ for a pure $B_z$ and we know the $H_{ij}$ for a pure $B_x$,
then the $H_{ij}$ for both $B_z$ and $B_x$ together is simply the sum.
This is certainly true if we consider only fields in the
$z$-direction—if we double $B_z$, then all the $H_{ij}$ are doubled.

and $B_z$, and which will give these energies when used in our general
formula of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII103">10.3</a>). The problem: find the Hamiltonian.
First, notice that the energy splitting is symmetric, with an average
value of zero. Looking at Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII103">10.3</a>), we can see directly
that that requires
\begin{equation*}
H_{22}=-H_{11}.
\end{equation*}

(Note that this checks with what we already know when $B_x$ and $B_y$
are both zero; in that case $H_{11}=-\mu B_z$, and $H_{22}=\mu B_z$.)
Now if we equate the energies of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII103">10.3</a>) with what
we know from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1019">10.19</a>), we have

\biggl(\!\frac{H_{11}\!-H_{22}}{2}\!\biggr)^2\!\!\!+\abs{H_{12}}^2=
\mu^2(B_x^2\!+\!B_y^2\!+\!B_z^2).
\end{equation}

(We have also made use of the fact that $H_{21}=H_{12}\cconj$, so that
$H_{12}H_{21}$ can also be written as $\abs{H_{12}}^2$.) Again for the
special case of a field in the $z$-direction, this gives
\begin{equation*}
\mu^2B_z^2+\abs{H_{12}}^2=\mu^2B_z^2.
\end{equation*}

Clearly, $\abs{H_{12}}$ must be zero in this special case, which means
that $H_{12}$ cannot have any terms in $B_z$. (Remember, we have said
that all terms must be linear in $B_x$, $B_y$, and $B_z$.)</p>

<div id="Ch10-S6-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">So far, then, we have discovered that $H_{11}$ and $H_{22}$ have terms

\begin{align*}
H_{11} &=-\mu B_z,\notag\\[2ex]

which <em class="emph">is</em> linear, namely,
\begin{equation*}
H_{12}=\mu(B_x+iB_y).

There are, in fact, several such possibilities—most generally, we
could write
\begin{equation*}
H_{12}=\mu(B_x\pm iB_y)e^{i\delta},

where $\delta$ is some arbitrary phase. Which sign and phase should we

minus sign and to take $e^{i\delta}=-1$. We might as well follow suit
and write
\begin{equation*}
H_{12}=-\mu(B_x-iB_y),\quad
H_{21}=-\mu(B_x+iB_y).

let the $x$-component of the field vary with time—say, as $\cos\omega
t$. The equations are then the same as we had when we put an oscillating
electric field on the ammonia molecule in Chapter <a href="III_09.html">9</a>. You
can work out the details in the same way. You will get the result that
the oscillating field causes transitions from the $+z$-state to the

<p class="p">Now let’s look at the following question. Suppose we have a magnetic
field $\FLPB$ which points in the direction whose polar angle
is $\theta$ and azimuthal angle is $\phi$, as in Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F10">10–10</a>.
Suppose, additionally, that there is an electron which has been prepared
with its spin pointing along this field. What are the amplitudes $C_1$
and $C_2$ for such an electron? In other words, calling the state of the
electron $\ket{\psi}$, we want to write
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\psi}=\ket{\slOne}C_1+\ket{\slTwo}C_2,
\end{equation*}

where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are
\begin{equation*}
C_1=\braket{\slOne}{\psi},\quad
C_2=\braket{\slTwo}{\psi},
\end{equation*}

where by $\ket{\slOne}$ and $\ket{\slTwo}$ we mean the same thing we
used to call $\ket{+}$ and $\ket{-}$ (referred to our chosen
$z$-axis).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S7-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">The answer to this question is also in our general equations for
two-state systems. First, we know that since the electron’s spin is
parallel to $\FLPB$ it is in a stationary state with
energy $E_{\slI}=-\mu B$. Therefore, both $C_1$ and $C_2$ must vary
as $e^{-iE_{\slI}t/\hbar}$, as in (<a href="III_09.html#mjx-eqn-EqIII918">9.18</a>); and their
coefficients $a_1$ and $a_2$ are given by (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII105">10.5</a>), namely,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:24}
\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\frac{H_{12}}{E_{\slI}-H_{11}}.
\end{equation}

An additional condition is that $a_1$ and $a_2$ should be normalized so
that $\abs{a_1}^2+\abs{a_2}^2=1$. We can take $H_{11}$ and $H_{12}$
from (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1022">10.22</a>) using
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation*}
B_z=B\cos\theta,\quad
B_x=B\sin\theta\cos\phi,\quad
B_y=B\sin\theta\sin\phi.

<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{align*}
B_z&=B\cos\theta,\\[.6ex]
B_x&=B\sin\theta\cos\phi,\\[.6ex]
B_y&=B\sin\theta\sin\phi.

</span>
So we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:25}
\begin{aligned}
H_{11}&=-\mu B\cos\theta,\\[1ex]
H_{12}&=-\mu B\sin\theta\,(\cos\phi-i\sin\phi).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The last factor in the second equation is, incidentally, $e^{-i\phi}$,
so it is simpler to write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:26}
H_{12}=-\mu B\sin\theta\,e^{-i\phi}.
\end{equation}

</div>
<div id="Ch10-S7-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Using these matrix elements in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1024">10.24</a>)—and
canceling $-\mu B$ from numerator and denominator—we find
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:27}
\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\frac{\sin\theta\,e^{-i\phi}}{1-\cos\theta}.
\end{equation}

With this ratio and the normalization condition, we can find both $a_1$
and $a_2$. That’s not hard, but we can make a short cut with a little
trick. Notice that $1-\cos\theta=2\sin^2\,(\theta/2)$, and that
$\sin\theta=2\sin\,(\theta/2)\cos\,(\theta/2)$. Then
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1027">10.27</a>) is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:28}
\frac{a_1}{a_2}=\frac{\cos\dfrac{\theta}{2}\,e^{-i\phi}}
{\sin\dfrac{\theta}{2}}.
\end{equation}

So one possible answer is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:29}
a_1=\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\,e^{-i\phi},\quad
a_2=\sin\frac{\theta}{2},
\end{equation}

since it fits with (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1028">10.28</a>) and also makes
\begin{equation*}
\abs{a_1}^2+\abs{a_2}^2=1.
\end{equation*}

As you know, multiplying both $a_1$ and $a_2$ by an arbitrary phase
factor doesn’t change anything. People generally prefer to make
Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1029">10.29</a>) more symmetric by multiplying both
by $e^{i\phi/2}$. So the form usually used is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:10:30}
a_1=\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\,e^{-i\phi/2},\quad
a_2=\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\,e^{+i\phi/2},
\end{equation}

and this is the answer to our question. The numbers $a_1$ and $a_2$
are the amplitudes to find an electron with its spin up or down along
the $z$-axis when we know that its spin is along the axis at $\theta$
and $\phi$. (The amplitudes $C_1$ and $C_2$ are just $a_1$ and $a_2$

<div id="Ch10-S7-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">As our final example lets look again at one which we’ve already
mentioned a number of times. Suppose that we consider the following
problem. We start with an electron whose spin is in some given
direction, then turn on a magnetic field in the $z$-direction for
$25$ minutes, and then turn it off. What is the final state? Again let’s
represent the state by the linear
combination $\ket{\psi}=\ket{\slOne}C_1+\ket{\slTwo}C_2$. For this
problem, however, the states of definite energy are also our base states
$\ket{\slOne}$ and $\ket{\slTwo}$. So $C_1$ and $C_2$ only vary in
phase. We know that
\begin{equation*}
C_1(t)=C_1(0)e^{-iE_{\slI}t/\hbar}=C_1(0)e^{+i\mu Bt/\hbar},
\end{equation*}

and
\begin{equation*}
C_2(t)=C_2(0)e^{-iE_{\slII}t/\hbar}=C_2(0)e^{-i\mu Bt/\hbar}.
\end{equation*}

Now initially we said the electron spin was set in a given direction.
That means that initially $C_1$ and $C_2$ are two numbers given by
Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1030">10.30</a>). After we wait for a period of time $T$, the
new $C_1$ and $C_2$ are the same two numbers multiplied respectively by
$e^{i\mu B_zT/\hbar}$ and $e^{-i\mu B_zT/\hbar}$. What state is that?
That’s easy. It’s exactly the same as if the angle $\phi$ had been
changed by the subtraction of $2\mu B_zT/\hbar$ and the angle $\theta$
had been left unchanged. That means that at the end of the time $T$, the
state $\ket{\psi}$ represents an electron lined up in a direction which
differs from the original direction only by a <em class="emph">rotation</em> about the
$z$-axis through the angle $\Delta\phi=2\mu B_zT/\hbar$. Since this
angle is proportional to $T$, we can also say the direction of the spin
<em class="emph">precesses</em> at the angular velocity $2\mu B_z/\hbar$ around the
$z$-axis. This result we discussed several times previously in a less
complete and rigorous manner. Now we have obtained a complete and

  What we
have said is a little misleading. Absorption of ultraviolet light would
be very weak in the two-state system we have taken for benzene, because
the dipole moment matrix element between the two states is zero. [The
two states are electrically symmetric, so in our formula
Eq. (<a href="III_09.html#mjx-eqn-EqIII955">9.55</a>) for the probability of a transition, the dipole
moment $\mu$ is zero and no light is absorbed.] If these were the only
states, the existence of the upper state would have to be shown in other
ways. A more complete theory of benzene, however, which begins with more
base states (such as those having adjacent double bonds) shows that the
true stationary states of benzene are slightly distorted from the ones
we have found. The resulting dipole moments permit the transition we
mentioned in the text to occur by the absorption of ultraviolet light.

  We are taking the rest energy $m_0c^2$
as our “zero” of energy and treating the magnetic moment $\mu$ of the
electron as a <em class="emph">negative</em> number, since it points opposite to the
spin.
