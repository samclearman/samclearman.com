<div id="Ch17-S1-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">In classical physics there are a number of quantities which are
<em class="emph">conserved</em>—such as momentum, energy, and angular
momentum. Conservation theorems about corresponding quantities also
exist in quantum mechanics. The most beautiful thing of quantum
mechanics is that the conservation theorems can, in a sense, be
derived from something else, whereas in classical mechanics they are
practically the starting points of the laws. (There are ways in
classical mechanics to do an analogous thing to what we will do in
quantum mechanics, but it can be done only at a very advanced level.)
In quantum mechanics, however, the conservation laws are very deeply
related to the principle of superposition of amplitudes, and to the
symmetry of physical systems under various changes. This is the
subject of the present chapter. Although we will apply these ideas
mostly to the conservation of angular momentum, the essential point is
that the theorems about the conservation of all kinds of quantities
are—in the quantum mechanics—related to the symmetries of the
system.

<div id="Ch17-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We begin, therefore, by studying the question of symmetries of
systems. A very simple example is the hydrogen molecular ion—we
could equally well take the ammonia molecule—in which there are two
states. For the hydrogen molecular ion we took as our base states one
in which the electron was located near proton number&nbsp;$1$, and another
in which the electron was located near proton number&nbsp;$2$. The two
states—which we called $\ket{\slOne}$ and&nbsp;$\ket{\slTwo}$—are shown
again in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F1">17–1</a>(a). Now, so long as the two nuclei
are both exactly the same, then there is a certain <em class="emph">symmetry</em> in
this physical system. That is to say, if we were to <em class="emph">reflect</em> the
system in the plane halfway between the two protons—by which we mean
that everything on one side of the plane gets moved to the symmetric
position on the other side—we would get the situations in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F1">17–1</a>(b). Since the protons are identical, the
<em class="emph">operation of reflection</em> changes $\ket{\slOne}$
into&nbsp;$\ket{\slTwo}$ and $\ket{\slTwo}$ into&nbsp;$\ket{\slOne}$. We’ll call this
reflection operation&nbsp;$\Pop$ and write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:1}
\Pop\,\ket{\slOne}=\ket{\slTwo},\quad
\Pop\,\ket{\slTwo}=\ket{\slOne}.
\end{equation}
So our $\Pop$ is an operator in the sense that it “<em class="emph">does
something</em>” to a state to make a new state. The interesting thing is
that $\Pop$ operating on <em class="emph">any</em> state produces some <em class="emph">other</em>
state of the system.

<div class="caption"><span class="tag">Fig. 17–1.</span>
If the states $\ket{\slOne}$ and&nbsp;$\ket{\slTwo}$ are reflected
in the plane&nbsp;$P$-$P$, they go into $\ket{\slTwo}$ and&nbsp;$\ket{\slOne}$,
respectively.
</div>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Now $\Pop$, like any of the other operators we have described, has
matrix elements which can be defined by the usual obvious
notation. Namely,
\begin{equation*}
P_{11}=\bracket{\slOne}{\Pop}{\slOne}\quad
\text{and}\quad
P_{12}=\bracket{\slOne}{\Pop}{\slTwo}
\end{equation*}
are the matrix elements we get if we multiply $\Pop\,\ket{\slOne}$
and&nbsp;$\Pop\,\ket{\slTwo}$ on the left by&nbsp;$\bra{\slOne}$. From
Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII171">17.1</a>) they are
\begin{align}
\bracket{\slOne}{\Pop}{\slOne}&=P_{11}=
\braket{\slOne}{\slTwo}=0,\notag\\[.5ex]
\label{Eq:III:17:2}
\bracket{\slOne}{\Pop}{\slTwo}&=P_{12}=
\braket{\slOne}{\slOne}=1.
\end{align}
In the same way we can get $P_{21}$ and&nbsp;$P_{22}$. The matrix
of&nbsp;$\Pop$—<em class="emph">with respect to the base system</em> $\ket{\slOne}$
and&nbsp;$\ket{\slTwo}$—is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:3}
P=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
We see once again that the words <em class="emph">operator</em> and <em class="emph">matrix</em> in
quantum mechanics are practically interchangeable. There are slight
technical differences—like the difference between a “numeral” and
a “number”—but the distinction is something pedantic that we don’t
have to worry about. So whether $\Pop$ defines an operation, or is
actually used to define a matrix of numbers, we will call it
interchangeably an operator or a matrix.

<div id="Ch17-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we would like to point out something. We will <em class="emph">suppose</em> that
the <em class="emph">physics</em> of the whole hydrogen molecular ion system is
<em class="emph">symmetrical</em>. It doesn’t have to be—it depends, for instance,
on what else is near it. But if the system is symmetrical, the
following idea should certainly be true. Suppose we start at&nbsp;$t=0$
with the system in the state&nbsp;$\ket{\slOne}$ and find after an interval
of time&nbsp;$t$ that the system turns out to be in a more complicated
situation—in some linear combination of the two base
states. Remember that in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="III_08.html">8</a> we used to represent
“going for a period of time” by multiplying by the
operator&nbsp;$\Uop$. That means that the system would after a while—say
$15$&nbsp;seconds to be definite—be in some other state. For example, it might
be $\sqrt{2/3}$&nbsp;parts of the state&nbsp;$\ket{\slOne}$ and
$i\sqrt{1/3}$&nbsp;parts of the state&nbsp;$\ket{\slTwo}$, and we would write
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:4}
\ket{\text{$\psi$ at $15$ sec}}=
\Uop(15,0)\,\ket{\slOne}=\sqrt{2/3}\,\ket{\slOne}
+i\sqrt{1/3}\,\ket{\slTwo}.
\end{equation}
</span>
<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{align}
\label{Eq:III:17:4}
\ket{\text{$\psi$ at $15$ sec}}&=\Uop(15,0)\,\ket{\slOne}\\[.7ex]
&=\sqrt{2/3}\,\ket{\slOne}+i\sqrt{1/3}\,\ket{\slTwo}.\notag
\end{align}
</span>
Now we ask what happens if we start the system in the <em class="emph">symmetric</em>
state&nbsp;$\ket{\slTwo}$ and wait for $15$&nbsp;seconds under the <em class="emph">same
conditions</em>? It is clear that if the world is symmetric—as we are
supposing—we should get the state symmetric to&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII174">17.4</a>):
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:5}
\ket{\text{$\psi$ at $15$ sec}}=
\Uop(15,0)\,\ket{\slTwo}=\sqrt{2/3}\,\ket{\slTwo}
+i\sqrt{1/3}\,\ket{\slOne}.
\end{equation}
</span>
<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{align}

\end{align}
</span>
The same ideas are sketched diagrammatically in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F2">17–2</a>.
So if the <em class="emph">physics</em> of a system is symmetrical with respect to some
plane, and we work out the behavior of a particular state, we also know
the behavior of the state we would get by reflecting the original state
in the symmetry plane.

<div id="Ch17-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We would like to say the same things a little bit more
generally—which means a little more abstractly. Let&nbsp;$\Qop$ be any
one of a number of operations that you could perform on a system
<em class="emph">without changing the physics</em>. For instance, for&nbsp;$\Qop$ we might
be thinking of&nbsp;$\Pop$, the operation of a <em class="emph">reflection</em> in the
plane between the two atoms in the hydrogen molecule. Or, in a system
with two electrons, we might be thinking of the operation of
<em class="emph">interchanging</em> the two electrons. Another possibility would be,
in a spherically symmetric system, the operation of a <em class="emph">rotation</em>
of the whole system through a finite angle around some axis—which
wouldn’t change the physics. Of course, we would normally want to give
each special case some special notation for&nbsp;$\Qop$. Specifically, we
will normally define the&nbsp;$\Rop_y(\theta)$ to be the operation “rotate
the system about the $y$-axis by the angle&nbsp;$\theta$”. By&nbsp;$\Qop$ we
mean just any one of the operators we have described or any other
one—which leaves the basic physical situation unchanged.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s think of some more examples. If we have an atom with <em class="emph">no
external magnetic</em> field or <em class="emph">no external electric</em> field, and if
we were to turn the coordinates around any axis, it would be the same
physical system. Again, the ammonia molecule is symmetrical with
respect to a reflection in a plane parallel to that of the three
hydrogens—so long as there is no electric field. When there is an
electric field, when we make a reflection we would have to change the
electric field also, and that changes the physical problem. But if we
have no external field, the molecule is symmetrical.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we consider a general situation. Suppose we start with the
state&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_1}$ and after some time or other under given physical
conditions it has become the state&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_2}$. We can write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:6}
\ket{\psi_2}=\Uop\,\ket{\psi_1}.
\end{equation}
[You can be thinking of Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII174">17.4</a>).] Now imagine we
perform the operation&nbsp;$\Qop$ on the whole system. The
state&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_1}$ will be transformed to a state&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_1'}$, which
we can also write as&nbsp;$\Qop\,\ket{\psi_1}$. Also the
state&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_2}$ is changed into&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_2'}=\Qop\,\ket{\psi_2}$. Now
<em class="emph">if the physics</em> is symmetrical under&nbsp;$\Qop$ (don’t forget the
<em class="emph">if</em>; it is not a general property of systems), then, waiting for
the same time under the same conditions, we should have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:7}
\ket{\psi_2'}=\Uop\,\ket{\psi_1'}.
\end{equation}
[Like Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII175">17.5</a>).] But we can write
$\Qop\,\ket{\psi_1}$ for&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_1'}$ and $\Qop\,\ket{\psi_2}$
for&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_2'}$ so&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII177">17.7</a>) can also be written
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:8}
\Qop\,\ket{\psi_2}=\Uop\Qop\,\ket{\psi_1}.
\end{equation}
If we now replace $\ket{\psi_2}$
by&nbsp;$\Uop\,\ket{\psi_1}$—Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII176">17.6</a>)—we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:9}
\Qop\Uop\,\ket{\psi_1}=\Uop\Qop\,\ket{\psi_1}.
\end{equation}
It’s not hard to understand what this means. Thinking of the hydrogen
ion it says that: “making a reflection and waiting a while”—the
expression on the right of Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII179">17.9</a>)—is the same as
“waiting a while and then making a reflection”—the expression on
the left of&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII179">17.9</a>). These should be the same so long
as&nbsp;$U$ doesn’t change under the reflection.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Since&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII179">17.9</a>) is true for <em class="emph">any</em> starting
state&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_1}$, it is really an equation about the operators:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:10}
\Qop\Uop=\Uop\Qop.
\end{equation}
This is what we wanted to get—<em class="emph">it is a mathematical statement
of symmetry</em>. When Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1710">17.10</a>) is true, we say that the
operators $\Uop$ and&nbsp;$\Qop$ <em class="emph">commute</em>. We can then <em class="emph">define</em>
“symmetry” in the following way: A physical system is
<em class="emph">symmetric</em> with respect to the operation&nbsp;$\Qop$ when $\Qop$
commutes with&nbsp;$\Uop$, the operation of the passage of time. [In terms
of matrices, the product of two operators is equivalent to the matrix
product, so Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1710">17.10</a>) also holds for the matrices $Q$
and&nbsp;$U$ for a system which is symmetric under the transformation&nbsp;$Q$.]

<div id="Ch17-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Incidentally, since for infinitesimal times&nbsp;$\epsilon$ we have
$\Uop=1-i\Hop\epsilon/\hbar$—where $\Hop$ is the usual Hamiltonian

if&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1710">17.10</a>) is true, it is also true that

So&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1711">17.11</a>) is the mathematical statement of the condition

<p class="p">Before applying the result we have just found, we would like to
discuss the idea of symmetry a little more. Suppose that we have a
very special situation: after we operate on a state with&nbsp;$\Qop$, we
get the same state. This is a very special case, but let’s suppose it
happens to be true for a state&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_0}$ that
$\ket{\psi'}=\Qop\,\ket{\psi_0}$ is physically the same state
as&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_0}$. That means that $\ket{\psi'}$ is equal
to&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_0}$ except for some phase factor.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> How can that
happen? For instance, suppose that we have an $\text{H}_2^+$ ion in the state
which we once called&nbsp;$\ket{\slI}$.<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a> For
this state there is equal amplitude to be in the base states
$\ket{\slOne}$ and&nbsp;$\ket{\slTwo}$. The probabilities are shown as a bar
graph in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F3">17–3</a>(a). If we operate on&nbsp;$\ket{\slI}$ with
the reflection operator&nbsp;$\Pop$, it flips the state over changing
$\ket{\slOne}$ to&nbsp;$\ket{\slTwo}$ and $\ket{\slTwo}$
to&nbsp;$\ket{\slOne}$—we get the probabilities shown in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F3">17–3</a>(b). But that’s just the state&nbsp;$\ket{\slI}$ all
over again. If we start with state&nbsp;$\ket{\slII}$ the probabilities
before and after reflection look just the same. However, there is a
difference if we look at the <em class="emph">amplitudes</em>. For the
state&nbsp;$\ket{\slI}$ the amplitudes are the <em class="emph">same</em> after the reflection,
but for the state&nbsp;$\ket{\slII}$ the amplitudes have the opposite sign.
In other words,

for the state&nbsp;$\ket{\slII}$.

<p class="p">Let’s look at another example. Suppose we have a RHC polarized photon

<p class="p">So with certain symmetries something which is true initially is true
for all times. But isn’t that just a <em class="emph">conservation law</em>? Yes! It
says that if you look at the original state and by making a little
computation on the side discover that an operation <em class="emph">which is a
symmetry operation of the system</em> produces only a multiplication by a
certain phase, then you know that the same property will be true of
the final state—the same operation multiplies the final state by the
same phase factor. This is always true even though we may not know
anything else about the inner mechanism of the universe which changes
a system from the initial to the final state. Even if we do not care
to look at the details of the machinery by which the system gets from
one state to another, we can still say that if a thing is in a state
with a certain symmetry character originally, and if the Hamiltonian
for this thing is symmetrical under that symmetry operation, then the
state will have the same symmetry character for all times. That’s the
basis of all the conservation laws of quantum mechanics.

<div id="Ch17-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s look at a special example. Let’s go back to the
$\Pop$&nbsp;operator. We would like first to modify a little our definition
of&nbsp;$\Pop$. We want to take for&nbsp;$\Pop$ not just a mirror reflection,
because that requires defining the plane in which we put the
mirror. There is a special kind of a reflection that doesn’t require
the specification of a plane. Suppose we redefine the operation&nbsp;$\Pop$
this way: First you reflect in a mirror in the $z$-plane so that $z$
goes to&nbsp;$-z$, $x$ stays&nbsp;$x$, and $y$ stays&nbsp;$y$; then you turn the
system $180^\circ$ about the $z$-axis so that $x$ is made to go
to&nbsp;$-x$ and $y$ to&nbsp;$-y$. The whole thing is called an
<em class="emph">inversion</em>. Every point is projected <em class="emph">through the origin</em>
to the diametrically opposite position. All the coordinates of
everything are reversed. We will still use the symbol&nbsp;$\Pop$ for this
operation. It is shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F4">17–4</a>. It is a little more
convenient than a simple reflection because it doesn’t require that you
specify which coordinate plane you used for the reflection—you need
specify only the point which is at the center of symmetry.

<p class="p">Now let’s suppose that we have a state&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_0}$ which under the

\label{Eq:III:17:16}
\ket{\psi_0'}=\Pop\,\ket{\psi_0}=e^{i\delta}\,\ket{\psi_0}.
\end{equation}
Then suppose that we invert again. After <em class="emph">two</em> inversions we are
right back where we started from—nothing is changed at all. We must
have that
\begin{equation*}
\Pop\,\ket{\psi_0'}=\Pop\!\cdot\!\Pop\,\ket{\psi_0}=\ket{\psi_0}.

But
\begin{equation*}
\Pop\!\cdot\!\Pop\,\ket{\psi_0}=\Pop e^{i\delta}\,\ket{\psi_0}

the same state. When we get the <em class="emph">same</em> state,
$\Pop\,\ket{\psi_0}=\ket{\psi_0}$, we say that the state&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_0}$
has <em class="emph">even parity</em>. When the sign is reversed so
that $\Pop\,\ket{\psi_0}=-\,\ket{\psi_0}$, we say that the state has
<em class="emph">odd parity</em>. (The inversion operator&nbsp;$\Pop$ is also known as the
parity operator.) The state&nbsp;$\ket{\slI}$ of the $\text{H}_2^+$ ion has even
parity; and the state&nbsp;$\ket{\slII}$ has odd parity—see
Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1712">17.12</a>). There are, of course, states which are not
symmetric under the operation&nbsp;$\Pop$; these are states with no definite
parity. For instance, in the $\text{H}_2^+$ system the state&nbsp;$\ket{\slI}$ has
even parity, the state&nbsp;$\ket{\slII}$ has odd parity, and the
state&nbsp;$\ket{\slOne}$ has no definite parity.

<p class="p">When we speak of an operation like inversion being performed
“<em class="emph">on a physical system</em>” we can think about it in two ways. We
can think of <em class="emph">physically moving</em> whatever is at&nbsp;$\FLPr$ to the

same system from a new frame of reference&nbsp;$x',y',z'$ related to the
old by $x'=-x$,&nbsp;$y'=-y$, and&nbsp;$z'=-z$. Similarly, when we think of
rotations, we can think of rotating bodily a physical system, or of
rotating the coordinate frame with respect to which we measure the
system, keeping the “system” fixed in space. Generally, the two
points of view are essentially equivalent. For rotation they are
equivalent <em class="emph">except</em> that rotating a <em class="emph">system</em> by the
angle&nbsp;$\theta$ is like rotating the reference frame by the <em class="emph">negative</em>
of&nbsp;$\theta$. In these lectures we have usually considered what happens
when a projection is made into a new set of axes. What you get that
way is the same as what you get if you leave the axes fixed and rotate

<p class="p">Many of the <em class="emph">laws</em> of physics—but not all—are unchanged by a
reflection or an inversion of the coordinates. They are
<em class="emph">symmetric</em> with respect to an inversion. The laws of
electrodynamics, for instance, are unchanged if we change $x$ to&nbsp;$-x$,
$y$ to&nbsp;$-y$, and $z$ to&nbsp;$-z$ in <em class="emph">all</em> the equations. The same is
true for the laws of gravity, and for the strong interactions of
nuclear physics. Only the weak interactions—responsible for
$\beta$-decay—do not have this symmetry. (We discussed this in some
detail in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="I_52.html">52</a>, Vol.&nbsp;I.) We will for now leave out
any consideration of the $\beta$-decays. Then in any physical system
where $\beta$-decays are not expected to produce any appreciable
effect—an example would be the emission of light by an atom—the
Hamiltonian&nbsp;$\Hop$ and the operator&nbsp;$\Pop$ will commute. Under these
circumstances we have the following proposition. If a state originally
has even parity, and if you look at the physical situation at some later
time, it will again have even parity. For instance, suppose an atom
about to emit a photon is in a state known to have even parity. You look
at the whole thing—including the photon—after the emission; it will
again have even parity (likewise if you start with odd parity). This
principle is called the <em class="emph">conservation of parity</em>. You can see why
the words “conservation of parity” and “reflection symmetry” are
closely intertwined in the quantum mechanics. Although until a few years
ago it was thought that nature always conserved parity, it is now known
that this is <em class="emph">not</em> true. It has been discovered to be false because
the $\beta$-decay reaction does not have the inversion symmetry which is
found in the other laws of physics.

<p class="p">Now we can prove an interesting theorem (which is true so long as we
can disregard weak interactions): Any state of definite energy which
is not degenerate must have a definite parity. It must have either
even parity or odd parity. (Remember that we have sometimes seen
systems in which several states have the same energy—we say that
such states are <em class="emph">degenerate</em>. Our theorem will not apply to
them.)

operating with&nbsp;$\Qop$. If the physics is symmetric, then
$\ket{\psi_0'}$ must have the same energy as&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_0}$. But we

So

it will also have the same property later on. So this number&nbsp;$m$ is a
very important one. If we know its value initially, we know its value
at the end of the game. It is a number which is <em class="emph">conserved</em>—$m$
is a <em class="emph">constant of the motion</em>. The reason that we pull out&nbsp;$m$ is
because it hasn’t anything to do with any special angle&nbsp;$\phi$, and

the same quantity is equal to the $z$-component of the angular
momentum of classical mechanics. So if we have a state for which a
rotation about the $z$-axis just produces a phase factor&nbsp;$e^{im\phi}$,
then we have a state of definite angular momentum about that
axis—and the angular momentum is conserved. It is&nbsp;$m\hbar$ now and
forever. Of course, you can rotate about any axis, and you get the
conservation of angular momentum for the various axes. You see that
the conservation of angular momentum is related to the fact that when
you turn a system you get the same state with only a new phase factor.

<div id="Ch17-S3-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We would like to show you how general this idea is. We will apply it
to two other conservation laws which have exact correspondence in the
physical ideas to the conservation of angular momentum. In classical
physics we also have conservation of momentum and conservation of
energy, and it is interesting to see that both of these are related in
the same way to some physical symmetry.

<div id="Ch17-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose that we have a physical system—an atom, some complicated
nucleus, or a molecule, or something—and it doesn’t make any
difference if we take the whole system and move it over to a different
place. So we have a Hamiltonian which has the property that it depends
only on the <em class="emph">internal coordinates</em> in some sense, and does not
depend on the <em class="emph">absolute position</em> in space. Under those
circumstances there is a special symmetry operation we can perform
which is a translation in space. Let’s define&nbsp;$\Dop_x(a)$ as the
operation of a displacement by the distance&nbsp;$a$ along the
$x$-axis. Then for any state we can make this operation and get a new
state. But again there can be very special states which have the
property that when you displace them by&nbsp;$a$ along the $x$-axis you get
the same state except for a phase factor. It’s also possible to prove,
just as we did above, that when this happens, the phase must be
proportional to&nbsp;$a$. So we can write for these special
states&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_0}$
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:23}
\Dop_x(a)\,\ket{\psi_0}=e^{ika}\,\ket{\psi_0}.
\end{equation}
The coefficient&nbsp;$k$, when multiplied by&nbsp;$\hbar$, is called <em class="emph">the
$x$-component of the momentum</em>. And the reason it is called that is
that this number is numerically equal to the classical momentum&nbsp;$p_x$
when we have a large system. The general statement is this: If the
Hamiltonian is unchanged when the system is displaced, and if the
state starts with a definite momentum in the $x$-direction, then the
momentum in the $x$-direction will remain the same as time goes
on. The total momentum of a system before and after collisions—or
after explosions or what not—will be the same.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">There is another operation that is quite analogous to the displacement
in space: a delay in time. Suppose that we have a physical situation
where there is <em class="emph">nothing external</em> that depends on time, and we
start something off at a certain moment in a given state and let it
roll. Now if we were to start the same thing off again (in another
experiment) two seconds later—or/say, delayed by a time&nbsp;$\tau$—and
if nothing in the external conditions depends on the absolute time,
the development would be the same and the final state would be the
same as the other final state, except that it will get there later by
the time&nbsp;$\tau$. Under those circumstances we can also find special
states which have the property that the development in time has the
special characteristic that the delayed state is just the old,
multiplied by a phase factor. Once more it is clear that for these
special states the phase change must be proportional to&nbsp;$\tau$. We can
write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:24}
\Dop_t(\tau)\,\ket{\psi_0}=e^{-i\omega\tau}\,\ket{\psi_0}.
\end{equation}
It is conventional to use the negative sign in defining&nbsp;$\omega$; with
this convention&nbsp;$\omega\hbar$ is the <em class="emph">energy</em> of the system,
<em class="emph">and it is conserved</em>. So a system of definite energy is one
which when displaced $\tau$ in time reproduces itself multiplied
by&nbsp;$e^{-i\omega\tau}$. (That’s what we have said before when we defined a
quantum state of definite energy, so we’re consistent with ourselves.)
It means that if a system is in a state of definite energy, and if the
Hamiltonian doesn’t depend on&nbsp;$t$, then no matter what goes on, the
system will have the same energy at all later times.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S3-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">You see, therefore, the relation between the conservation laws and the
symmetry of the world. Symmetry with respect to displacements in time
implies the conservation of energy; symmetry with respect to position
in $x$,&nbsp;$y$, or&nbsp;$z$ implies the conservation of that component of
momentum. Symmetry with respect to rotations around the $x$-,&nbsp;$y$-,
and&nbsp;$z$-axes implies the conservation of the $x$-,&nbsp;$y$-,
and&nbsp;$z$-components of angular momentum. Symmetry with respect to
reflection implies the conservation of parity. Symmetry with respect
to the interchange of two electrons implies the conservation of
something we don’t have a name for, and so on. Some of these
principles have classical analogs and others do not. There are more
conservation laws in quantum mechanics than are useful in classical
mechanics—or, at least, than are usually made use of.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S3-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">In order that you will be able to read other books on quantum
mechanics, we must make a small technical aside—to describe the
notation that people use. The operation of a displacement with respect
to time is, of course, just the operation&nbsp;$\Uop$ that we talked about
before:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:25}
\Dop_t(\tau)=\Uop(t+\tau,t).
\end{equation}
Most people like to discuss everything in terms of
<em class="emph">infinitesimal</em> displacements in time, or in terms of
infinitesimal displacements in space, or in terms of rotations through
infinitesimal angles. Since any finite displacement or angle can be
accumulated by a succession of infinitesimal displacements or angles,
it is often easier to analyze first the infinitesimal case. The
operator of an infinitesimal displacement&nbsp;$\Delta t$ in time is—as
we have defined it in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="III_08.html">8</a>—
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:26}
\Dop_t(\Delta t)=1-\frac{i}{\hbar}\,\Delta t\Hop.
\end{equation}
Then $\Hop$ is analogous to the classical quantity we call energy,
because if $\Hop\,\ket{\psi}$ happens to be a constant
times&nbsp;$\ket{\psi}$ namely, $\Hop\,\ket{\psi}=E\,\ket{\psi}$ then that
constant is the energy of the system.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S3-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">The same thing is done for the other operations. If we make a small
displacement in&nbsp;$x$, say by the amount&nbsp;$\Delta x$, a
state&nbsp;$\ket{\psi}$ will, <em class="emph">in general</em>, go over into some other
state&nbsp;$\ket{\psi'}$. We can write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:27}
\ket{\psi'}=\Dop_x(\Delta x)\,\ket{\psi}=
\Bigl(1+\frac{i}{\hbar}\,\pop_x\Delta x\Bigr)\ket{\psi},
\end{equation}
since as&nbsp;$\Delta x$ goes to zero, the&nbsp;$\ket{\psi'}$ should become
just&nbsp;$\ket{\psi}$ or $\Dop_x(0)=1$, and for small&nbsp;$\Delta x$ the change
of&nbsp;$\Dop_x(\Delta x)$ from&nbsp;$1$ should be proportional to&nbsp;$\Delta
x$. Defined this way, the operator&nbsp;$\pop_x$ is called the momentum
operator—for the $x$-component, of course.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S3-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">For identical reasons, people usually write for small rotations
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:28}
\Rop_z(\Delta\phi)\,\ket{\psi}=
\Bigl(1+\frac{i}{\hbar}\,\Jop_z\Delta\phi\Bigr)\ket{\psi}
\end{equation}
and call $\Jop_z$ the operator of the $z$-component of angular
momentum. For those special states for which
$\Rop_z(\phi)\,\ket{\psi_0}=e^{im\phi}\,\ket{\psi_0}$, we can for any
small angle—say&nbsp;$\Delta\phi$—expand the right-hand side to first
order in&nbsp;$\Delta\phi$ and get
\begin{equation*}
\Rop_z(\Delta\phi)\,\ket{\psi_0}=
e^{im\Delta\phi}\,\ket{\psi_0}=
(1+im\Delta\phi)\,\ket{\psi_0}.
\end{equation*}
Comparing this with the definition of&nbsp;$\Jop_z$ in
Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1728">17.28</a>), we get that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:29}
\Jop_z\,\ket{\psi_0}=m\hbar\,\ket{\psi_0}.
\end{equation}
In other words, if you operate with&nbsp;$\Jop_z$ on a state <em class="emph">with a

the same state, where $m\hbar$ is the amount of $z$-component of

remember from this chapter is that if a state&nbsp;$\ket{\psi_0}$ has the
property that upon a rotation through an angle&nbsp;$\phi$ about the
$z$-axis, it becomes&nbsp;$e^{im\phi}\,\ket{\psi_0}$; it has a
$z$-component of angular momentum equal to&nbsp;$m\hbar$. That’s all we

<p class="p">First of all we would like to check on one idea. In

It also means that if we have a beam of light containing a large number
of photons all circularly polarized the same way—as we would have in a
classical beam—it will carry angular momentum. If the total energy
carried by the beam in a certain time is&nbsp;$W$, then there are
$N=W/\hbar\omega$&nbsp;photons. Each one carries the angular

<div id="Ch17-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Can we prove classically that light which is right circularly
polarized carries an energy and angular momentum in proportion
to&nbsp;$W/\omega$?  That should be a classical proposition if everything is
right. Here we have a case where we can go from the quantum thing to
the classical thing. We should see if the classical physics checks. It
will give us an idea whether we have a right to call&nbsp;$m$ the angular
momentum. Remember what right circularly polarized light is,
classically. It’s described by an electric field with an oscillating
$x$-component and an oscillating $y$-component $90^\circ$&nbsp;out of phase
so that the resultant electric vector&nbsp;$\Efieldvec$ goes in a
circle—as drawn in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F5">17–5</a>(a). Now suppose that such
light shines on a wall which is going to absorb it—or at least some of
it—and consider an atom in the wall according to the classical
physics. We have often described the motion of the electron in the atom
as a harmonic oscillator which can be driven into oscillation by an
external electric field. We’ll suppose that the atom is isotropic, so
that it can oscillate equally well in the $x$- or&nbsp;$y$-directions. Then
in the circularly polarized light, the $x$-displacement and the
$y$-displacement are the same, but one is $90^\circ$&nbsp;behind the other.
The net result is that the electron moves in a circle, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F5">17–5</a>(b). The electron is displaced at some
displacement&nbsp;$\FLPr$ from its equilibrium position at the origin and
goes around with some phase lag with respect to the vector&nbsp;$\Efieldvec$.
The relation between $\Efieldvec$ and&nbsp;$\FLPr$ might be as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F5">17–5</a>(b). As time goes on, the electric field
rotates and the displacement rotates with the same frequency, so their
relative orientation stays the same. Now let’s look at the work being
done on this electron. The rate that energy is being put into this
electron is&nbsp;$v$, its velocity, times the component of&nbsp;$q\Efieldvec$
parallel to the velocity:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:31}
\ddt{W}{t}=q\Efield_tv.
\end{equation}
But look, there is angular momentum being poured into this electron,
because there is always a torque about the origin. The torque
is&nbsp;$q\Efield_tr$, which must be equal to the rate of change of angular
momentum&nbsp;$dJ_z/dt$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:32}
\ddt{J_z}{t}=q\Efield_tr.
\end{equation}
Remembering that $v=\omega r$, we have that
\begin{equation*}
\ddt{J_z}{W}=\frac{1}{\omega}.
\end{equation*}
Therefore, if we integrate the total angular momentum which is
absorbed, it is proportional to the total energy—the constant of
proportionality being&nbsp;$1/\omega$, which agrees with
Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1730">17.30</a>). Light does carry angular momentum—$1$&nbsp;unit
(times&nbsp;$\hbar$) if it is right circularly polarized along the $z$-axis,
and $-1$&nbsp;unit along the $z$-axis if it is left circularly polarized.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let’s ask the following question: If light is linearly polarized
in the $x$-direction, what is its angular momentum? Light polarized in
the $x$-direction can be represented as the superposition of RHC and
LHC polarized light. Therefore, there is a certain amplitude that the
angular momentum is&nbsp;$+\hbar$ and another amplitude that the angular
momentum is&nbsp;$-\hbar$, so it doesn’t have a <em class="emph">definite</em> angular
momentum. It has an amplitude to appear with&nbsp;$+\hbar$ and an equal
amplitude to appear with&nbsp;$-\hbar$. The interference of these two
amplitudes produces the linear polarization, but it has <em class="emph">equal</em>
probabilities to appear with plus or minus one unit of angular
momentum. Macroscopic measurements made on a beam of linearly
polarized light will show that it carries zero angular momentum,
because in a large number of photons there are nearly equal numbers of
RHC and LHC photons contributing opposite amounts of angular
momentum—the average angular momentum is zero. And in the classical
theory you don’t find the angular momentum unless there is some
circular polarization.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">We have said that any spin-one particle can have three values of&nbsp;$J_z$,
namely $+1,0,-1$ (the three states we saw in the Stern-Gerlach
experiment). But light is screwy; it has only two states. It does not
have the zero case. This strange lack is related to the fact that light
cannot stand still. For a particle of spin&nbsp;$j$ which is standing still,
there must be the $2j+1$&nbsp;possible states with values of&nbsp;$j_z$ going in
steps of&nbsp;$1$ from $-j$ to&nbsp;$+j$. But it turns out that for something of
spin&nbsp;$j$ with zero mass only the states with the components $+j$
and&nbsp;$-j$ along the direction of motion exist. For example, light does
not have three states, but only two—although a photon is still an
object of spin one. How is this consistent with our earlier
proofs—based on what happens under rotations in space—that for
spin-one particles three states are necessary? For a particle at rest,
rotations can be made about any axis without changing the momentum
state. Particles with zero rest mass (like photons and neutrinos) cannot
be at rest; only rotations about the axis along the direction of motion
do not change the momentum state. Arguments about rotations around one
axis only are insufficient to prove that three states are required,
given that one of them varies as&nbsp;$e^{i\phi}$ under rotations by the
angle&nbsp;$\phi$.<a name="footnote_source_9" href="#footnote_9"><sup class="mark">9</sup></a>

</div>

<div id="Ch17-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">One further side remark. For a zero rest mass particle, in general,
<em class="emph">only one</em> of the two spin states with respect to the line of
motion ($+j$,&nbsp;$-j$) is really necessary. For neutrinos—which are
spin one-half particles—only the states with the component of
angular momentum <em class="emph">opposite</em> to the direction of
motion&nbsp;$(-\hbar/2)$ exist in nature [and only <em class="emph">along</em> the
motion&nbsp;$(+\hbar/2)$ for antineutrinos]. When a system has inversion symmetry
(so that parity is conserved, as it is for light) both components
($+j$, and&nbsp;$-j$) are required.

A $\Lambda^0$ with spin “up” decays into a proton and a pion

</div>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we want to give an example of how we use the theorem of
conservation of angular momentum in a specifically quantum physical
problem. We look at break-up of the lambda particle&nbsp;($\Lambda^0$),
which disintegrates into a proton and a $\pi^-$&nbsp;meson by a “weak”
interaction:
\begin{equation*}
\Lambda^0\to\text{p}+\pi^-.
\end{equation*}
Assume we know that the pion has spin zero, that the proton has spin
one-half, and that the $\Lambda^0$ has spin one-half. We would like to
solve the following problem: Suppose that a $\Lambda^0$ were to be
produced in a way that caused it to be completely polarized—by which
we mean that its spin is, say “up,” with respect to some suitably
chosen $z$-axis—see Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F6">17–6</a>(a). The question is,
with what probability will it disintegrate so that the proton goes off
at an angle&nbsp;$\theta$ with respect to the $z$-axis—as in
Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F6">17–6</a>(b)? In other words, what is the angular
distribution of the disintegrations? We will look at the disintegration
in the coordinate system in which the $\Lambda^0$ is at rest—we will
measure the angles in this rest frame; then they can always be
transformed to another frame if we want.

Two possibilities for the decay of a spin “up” $\Lambda^0$
with the proton going along the $+z$-axis. Only&nbsp;(b) conserves angular
momentum.
</div>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We begin by looking at the special circumstance in which the proton is
emitted into a small solid angle&nbsp;$\Delta\Omega$ along the $z$-axis
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F7">17–7</a>). Before the disintegration we have a
$\Lambda^0$ with its spin “up,” as in part&nbsp;(a) of the figure. After a
short time—for reasons unknown to this day, except that they are
connected with the weak decays—the $\Lambda^0$ explodes into a proton
and a pion. Suppose the proton goes up along the $+z$-axis. Then, from
the conservation of momentum, the pion must go down. Since the proton is
a spin one-half particle, its spin must be either “up” or
“down”—there are, in principle, the two possibilities shown in parts
(b) and&nbsp;(c) of the figure. The conservation of angular momentum,
however, requires that the proton have spin “up.” This is most easily
seen from the following argument. A particle moving along the $z$-axis
cannot contribute any angular momentum about this axis by virtue of its
motion; therefore, only the spins can contribute to&nbsp;$J_z$. The spin
angular momentum about the $z$-axis is&nbsp;$+\hbar/2$ before the
disintegration, so it must also be&nbsp;$+\hbar/2$ afterward. We can say that
since the pion has no spin, the proton spin must be “up.”
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">If you are worried that arguments of this kind may not be valid in
quantum mechanics, we can take a moment to show you that they are. The
initial state (before the disintegration), which we can
call&nbsp;$\ket{\Lambda^0,\text{spin $+z$}}$ has the property that if it is
rotated about the $z$-axis by the angle&nbsp;$\phi$, the state vector gets
multiplied by the phase factor&nbsp;$e^{i\phi/2}$. (In the rotated system
the state vector is&nbsp;$e^{i\phi/2}\,\ket{\Lambda^0,\text{spin $+z$}}$.)
That’s what we mean by spin “up” for a spin one-half particle. Since
nature’s behavior doesn’t depend on our choice of axes, the final
state (the proton plus pion) must have the same property. We could
write the final state as, say,
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\text{proton going $+z$, spin $+z$; pion going $-z$}}.
\end{equation*}
But we really do not need to specify the pion motion, since in the
frame we have chosen the pion always moves opposite the proton; we can
simplify our description of the final state to
\begin{equation*}
\ket{\text{proton going $+z$, spin $+z$}}.
\end{equation*}
Now what happens to this state vector if we rotate the coordinates
about the $z$-axis by the angle&nbsp;$\phi$?
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Since the proton and pion are moving along the $z$-axis, their motion
isn’t changed by the rotation. (That’s why we picked this special
case; we couldn’t make the argument otherwise.) Also, nothing happens
to the pion, because it is spin zero. The proton, however, has spin
one-half. If its spin is “up” it will contribute a phase change
of&nbsp;$e^{i\phi/2}$ in response to the rotation. (If its spin were “down”
the phase change due to the proton would be&nbsp;$e^{-i\phi/2}$.) But the
phase change with rotation before and after the excitement must be the
same if angular momentum is to be conserved. (And it will be, since
there are no outside influences in the Hamiltonian.) So the only
possibility is that the proton spin will be “up.” If the proton goes
up, its spin must also be “up.”
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch17-S5-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We conclude, then, that the conservation of angular momentum permits the
process shown in part&nbsp;(b) of Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F7">17–7</a>, but does not
permit the process shown in part&nbsp;(c). Since we know that the
disintegration occurs, there is some amplitude for process&nbsp;(b)—proton
going up with spin “up.” We’ll let&nbsp;$a$ stand for the amplitude that
the disintegration occurs in this way in any infinitesimal interval of

the states we are talking about.

<p class="p">We want to know the probability that the proton will go off at the
angle&nbsp;$\theta$ with respect to the $z$-axis (into a small solid
angle&nbsp;$\Delta\Omega$) as drawn in Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-F6">17–6</a>. Let’s put a new
$z$-axis in this direction and call it the $z'$-axis. We know how to
analyze what happens along this axis. With respect to this new axis, the
$\Lambda^0$ no longer has its spin “up,” but has a certain amplitude
to have its spin “up” and another amplitude to have its spin “down.”
 We have already worked these out in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="III_06.html">6</a>, and again
in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="III_10.html">10</a>, Eq.&nbsp;(<a href="III_10.html#mjx-eqn-EqIII1030">10.30</a>). The amplitude

“up” along the $z'$-axis it will emit a proton in the $+z'$-direction

proton coming out along the $z'$-direction is
\begin{equation}

<p class="p">Let’s now ask the following easy question. If the $\Lambda^0$ has spin
up along the $z$-axis, what is the probability that the decay proton
will go off at the angle&nbsp;$\theta$? The two spin states (“up” or
“down” along&nbsp;$z'$) are distinguishable even though we are not going
to look at them. So to get the probability we square the amplitudes
and add. The probability&nbsp;$f(\theta)$ of finding a proton in a small
solid angle&nbsp;$\Delta\Omega$ at&nbsp;$\theta$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:35}
f(\theta)=\abs{a}^2\cos^2\frac{\theta}{2}+
\abs{b}^2\sin^2\frac{\theta}{2}.
\end{equation}
Remembering that $\sin^2\theta/2=\tfrac{1}{2}(1-\cos\theta)$ and that
$\cos^2\theta/2=\tfrac{1}{2}(1+\cos\theta)$, we can write&nbsp;$f(\theta)$
as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:36}
f(\theta)=\!\biggl(\frac{\abs{a}^2\!+\abs{b}^2}{2}\biggr)\!+\!
\biggl(\frac{\abs{a}^2\!-\abs{b}^2}{2}\biggr)\!\cos\theta.
\end{equation}
The angular distribution has the form
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:37}
f(\theta)=\beta(1+\alpha\cos\theta).
\end{equation}
The probability has one part that is independent of&nbsp;$\theta$ and one
part that varies linearly with&nbsp;$\cos\theta$. From measuring the
angular distribution we can get $\alpha$ and&nbsp;$\beta$, and therefore,
$\abs{a}$ and&nbsp;$\abs{b}$.

<div id="Ch17-S5-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Now there are many other questions we can answer. Are we interested
only in protons with spin “up” along the <em class="emph">old</em> $z$-axis? Each
of the terms in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1733">17.33</a>) and&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1734">17.34</a>) will
give an amplitude to find a proton with spin “up” and with spin
“down” with respect to the $z'$-axis ($+z'$ and&nbsp;$-z'$). Spin “up”
with respect to the old axis&nbsp;$\ket{+z}$ can be expressed in terms of
the base states $\ket{+z'}$ and&nbsp;$\ket{-z'}$. We can then combine the
two amplitudes (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1733">17.33</a>) and&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1734">17.34</a>) with the
proper coefficients ($\cos\theta/2$ and&nbsp;$-\sin\theta/2$) to get the
total amplitude
\begin{equation*}
\biggl(a\cos^2\frac{\theta}{2}+b\sin^2\frac{\theta}{2}\biggr).

Its square is the probability that the proton comes out at the

If the amplitudes written in (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1733">17.33</a>)

mathematically as follows. By&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1733">17.33</a>) we intend the
amplitude that the $\Lambda$ with spin along&nbsp;$+z$ will disintegrate into
a proton moving along the $+z'$-direction with its spin also in the
$+z'$-direction, namely the amplitude
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:17:42}
\bracket{\text{proton going $+z'$, spin $+z'$}}
{H}
{\text{$\Lambda$, spin $+z$}}.

By the general theorems of quantum mechanics, this amplitude can be

\sum_i
\bracket{\text{proton going $+z'$, spin $+z'$}}
{H}{\Lambda,i}
\braket{\Lambda,i}

where the sum is to be taken over the base states&nbsp;$\ket{\Lambda,i}$ of

The first factor of the first term is&nbsp;$a$, and the first factor of the

from&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1741">17.41</a>), which in turn follows from angular momentum
conservation. The remaining factor&nbsp;$\braket{\Lambda,+z'}{\Lambda,+z}$
of the first term is just the amplitude that a spin one-half particle
which has spin “up” along one axis will also have spin “up” along
an axis tilted at the angle&nbsp;$\theta$, which is&nbsp;$\cos\theta/2$—see
Table&nbsp;<a href="III_06.html#Ch6-T2">6–2</a>. So&nbsp;(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII1744">17.44</a>) is

have learned about the rotations for particles of spin one-half and
spin one—so they will be convenient for future reference. On the
next page you will find tables of the two rotation matrices
$R_z(\phi)$ and&nbsp;$R_y(\theta)$ for spin one-half particles, for
spin-one particles, and for photons (spin-one particles with zero rest
mass). For each spin we will give the terms of the
matrix&nbsp;$\bracket{j}{R}{i}$ for rotations about the $z$-axis or the
$y$-axis. They are, of course, exactly equivalent to the amplitudes
like&nbsp;$\braket{+T}{\OS}$ we have used in earlier chapters. We mean
by&nbsp;$R_z(\phi)$ that the state is projected into a new coordinate system
which is rotated through the angle&nbsp;$\phi$ about the $z$-axis—using
always the right-hand rule to define the positive sense of the
rotation. By&nbsp;$R_y(\theta)$ we mean that the reference axes are rotated
by the angle&nbsp;$\theta$ about the $y$-axis. Knowing these two rotations,
you can, of course, work out any arbitrary rotation. As usual, we
write the matrix elements so that the state on the <em class="emph">left</em> is a
base state of the <em class="emph">new</em> (rotated) frame and the state on the
right is a base state of the old (unrotated) frame. You can interpret
the entries in the tables in many ways. For instance, the
entry&nbsp;$e^{-i\phi/2}$ in Table&nbsp;<a href="#Ch17-T1">17–1</a> means that the matrix
element&nbsp;$\bracket{-}{R}{-}=e^{-i\phi/2}$. It also means that

Incidentally,
you can show that $\Qop$ is necessarily a <em class="emph">unitary
operator</em>—which means that if it operates on&nbsp;$\ket{\psi}$ to give
some number times&nbsp;$\ket{\psi}$, the number must be of the
form&nbsp;$e^{i\delta}$, where $\delta$ is real. It’s a small point, and the
proof rests on the following observation. Any operation like a
reflection or a rotation doesn’t lose any particles, so the
normalization of $\ket{\psi'}$ and&nbsp;$\ket{\psi}$ must be the same; they
can only differ by a pure imaginary phase factor.

See
Section&nbsp;<a href="III_10.html#Ch10-S1">10-1</a>. The states $\ket{\slI}$ and&nbsp;$\ket{\slII}$
are reversed in this Section relative to the earlier discussion.

In other books you may find
formulas with different signs; they are probably using a different
definition of the angles.

Very precisely, we will define&nbsp;$\Rop_z(\phi)$ as a
rotation of the physical system by&nbsp;$-\phi$ about the $z$-axis, which
is the same as rotating the coordinate frame by&nbsp;$+\phi$.

We can always choose&nbsp;$z$ along the direction
of the field provided there is only one field at a time, and its
direction doesn’t change.

For
a fancier proof we should make this argument for small
rotations&nbsp;$\epsilon$. Since any angle&nbsp;$\phi$ is the sum of a suitable $n$&nbsp;number
of these, $\phi=n\epsilon$, $\Rop_z(\phi)=[\Rop_z(\epsilon)]^n$ and
the total phase change is $n$&nbsp;times that for the small
angle&nbsp;$\epsilon$, and is, therefore, proportional to&nbsp;$\phi$.

Sorry! This angle is the negative of the one we used
in Section&nbsp;<a href="III_11.html#Ch11-S4">11-4</a>.

It is
usually very convenient to measure angular momentum of atomic systems in
units of&nbsp;$\hbar$. Then you can say that a spin one-half particle has
angular momentum&nbsp;$\pm1/2$ with respect to any axis. Or, in general, that
the $z$-component of angular momentum is&nbsp;$m$. You don’t need to repeat
the&nbsp;$\hbar$ all the time.
	  <a href="#footnote_source_8">↩</a>
	</li>
	
	<li class="footnote">
	  <a name="footnote_9"></a>
We have tried to find at least a proof that the
component of angular momentum along the direction of motion must for a
zero mass particle be an integral multiple of&nbsp;$\hbar/2$—and not
something like&nbsp;$\hbar/3$. Even using all sorts of properties of the
Lorentz transformation and what not, we failed. Maybe it’s not true.
We’ll have to talk about it with Prof. Wigner, who knows all
about such things.

We are now assuming that the machinery of the quantum
mechanics is sufficiently familiar to you that we can speak about things
in a physical way without taking the time to write down all the
mathematical details. In case what we are saying here is not clear to
you, we have put some of the missing details in a note at the end of the
section.

We have chosen to let&nbsp;$z'$ be in the $xz$-plane and
use the matrix elements for&nbsp;$R_y(\theta)$. You would get the same answer
for any other choice.
