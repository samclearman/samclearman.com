<p class="p">Most of our work in this course has been aimed at reaching
the complete equations of Maxwell. In the last two chapters
we have been discussing the consequences of these equations. We have
found that the equations contain all the static phenomena we had worked
out earlier, as well as the phenomena of electromagnetic waves and light
that we had gone over in some detail in Volume I. The Maxwell
equations
give both phenomena, depending upon whether one computes the fields
close to the currents and charges, or very far from them. There is not
much interesting to say about the intermediate region; no special
phenomena appear there.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">There still remain, however, several subjects in electromagnetism that
we want to take up. We want to discuss the question of relativity and
the Maxwell equations—what happens when one
looks at the Maxwell equations with respect to moving
coordinate systems. There is also the question of the conservation of
energy in electromagnetic systems. Then there is the broad subject of
the electromagnetic properties of materials; so far, except for the
study of the properties of dielectrics, we have considered only the
electromagnetic fields in free space. And although we covered the
subject of light in some detail in Volume I, there are still a few
things we would like to do again from the point of view of the field
equations.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">In particular, we want to take up again the subject of the index of
refraction, particularly for dense materials. Finally, there are the
phenomena associated with waves confined in a limited region of space.
We touched on this kind of problem briefly when we were studying sound
waves. Maxwell’s equations
lead also to solutions which represent confined waves of the electric
and magnetic fields. We will take up this subject, which has important
technical applications, in some of the following chapters. In order to
lead up to that subject, we will begin by considering the properties of
electrical circuits at low frequencies. We will then be able to make a
comparison between those situations in which the almost static
approximations of Maxwell’s equations are applicable and those situations in which high-frequency
effects are dominant.

<div id="Ch22-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">So we descend from the great and esoteric heights of the last few
chapters and turn to the relatively low-level subject of electrical
circuits. We will see, however, that even such a mundane subject, when
looked at in sufficient detail, can contain great complications.</p>

<div id="Ch22-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We have already discussed some of the properties of electrical circuits
in Chapters <a href="I_23.html">23</a> and <a href="I_25.html">25</a> of Vol. I. Now we will
cover some of the same material again, but in greater detail. Again we
are going to deal only with linear systems and with voltages and
currents which all vary sinusoidally; we can then represent all voltages
and currents by complex numbers, using the exponential notation
described in Chapter <a href="I_23.html">23</a> of Vol. I. Thus a time-varying
voltage $V(t)$ will be written
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:1}
V(t)=\hat{V}e^{i\omega t},
\end{equation}

where $\hat{V}$ represents a complex number that is independent
of $t$. It is, of course, understood that the actual time-varying
voltage $V(t)$ is given by the <em class="emph">real part</em> of the complex function on the
right-hand side of the equation.</p>

<p class="p">In our earlier discussion of circuits we assumed that such things as
inductances, capacitances, and resistances were familiar to you. We
want now to look in a little a more detail at what is meant by these
idealized circuit elements. We begin with the inductance.</p>

</div>
<div id="Ch22-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">An inductance is made by winding many turns of wire in the form of a
coil and bringing the two ends out to terminals at some distance from
the coil, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F1">22–1</a>. We want to assume that
the magnetic field produced by currents in the coil does not spread
out strongly all over space and interact with other parts of the
circuit. This is usually arranged by winding the coil in a
doughnut-shaped form, or by confining the magnetic field by winding
the coil on a suitable iron core, or by placing the coil in some
suitable metal box, as indicated schematically in
Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F1">22–1</a>. In any case, we assume that there is a
negligible magnetic field in the external region near the terminals $a$
and $b$. We are also going to assume that we can neglect any electrical
resistance in the wire of the coil. Finally, we will assume that we can
neglect the amount of electrical charge that appears on the surface of a
wire in building up the electric fields.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">With all these approximations we have what we call an “ideal”
inductance. (We will come back later and discuss what happens in a
real inductance.) For an ideal inductance we say that the voltage
across the terminals is equal to $L(dI/dt)$. Let’s see why that is
so. When there is a current through the inductance, a magnetic field
proportional to the current is built up inside the coil. If the
current changes with time, the magnetic field also changes. In
general, the curl of $\FLPE$ is equal to $-\ddpl{\FLPB}{t}$; or, put
differently, the line integral of $\FLPE$ all the way around any
closed path is equal to the negative of the rate of change of the flux
of $\FLPB$ through the loop. Now suppose we consider the following
path: Begin at terminal $a$ and go along the coil (staying always
inside the wire) to terminal $b$; then return from terminal $b$ to
terminal $a$ through the air in the space outside the inductance. The
line integral of $\FLPE$ around this closed path can be written as the
sum of two parts:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:3}
\oint\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs=\kern{-1ex}
\underset{\substack{\text{via}\\\text{coil}}}{\int_a^b}
\kern{-.5ex}\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs\;+\kern{-.75ex}
\underset{\text{outside}}{\int_b^a}
\kern{-1.5ex}\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation}
As we have seen before, there can be no electric fields inside a
perfect conductor. (The smallest fields would produce infinite
currents.) Therefore the integral from $a$ to $b$ via the coil is
zero. The whole contribution to the line integral of $\FLPE$ comes
from the path outside the inductance from terminal $b$ to
terminal $a$. Since we have assumed that there are no magnetic fields in the
space outside of the “box,” this part of the integral is independent
of the path chosen and we can define the potentials of the two
terminals. The difference of these two potentials is what we call the
voltage difference, or simply the voltage $V$, so we have
\begin{equation*}
V=-\int_b^a\kern{-1ex}\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs=-\oint\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation*}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">The complete line integral is what we have before called the
electromotive force $\emf$ and is, of course, equal to the rate of
change of the magnetic flux in the coil. We have seen earlier that
this emf is equal to the negative rate of change of the current, so we
have
\begin{equation*}
V=-\emf=L\,\ddt{I}{t},
\end{equation*}

where $L$ is the inductance of the coil. Since $dI/dt=i\omega I$, we
have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:4}
V=i\omega LI.

</div>
<div id="Ch22-S1-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">The way we have described the ideal inductance illustrates the general
approach to other ideal circuit elements—usually called “lumped”
elements. The properties of the element are described completely in
terms of currents and voltages that appear at the terminals. By making
suitable approximations, it is possible to ignore the great
complexities of the fields that appear inside the object. A separation
is made between what happens inside and what happens outside.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-S1-p13" class="para">
<p class="p">For all the circuit elements we will find a relation like the one in
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII224">22.4</a>), in which the voltage is proportional to the
current with a proportionality constant that is, in general, a complex
number. This complex coefficient of proportionality is called the
<em class="emph">impedance</em> and is usually written as $z$ (not to be confused
with the $z$-coordinate). It is, in general, a function of the
frequency $\omega$. So for any lumped element we write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:5}
\frac{V}{I}=\frac{\hat{V}}{\hat{I}}=z.
\end{equation}

For an inductance, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:6}
z\,(\text{inductance})=z_L=i\omega L.

<div id="Ch22-S1-p14" class="para">
<p class="p">Now let’s look at a capacitor from the same point of
view.<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> A capacitor consists of a pair of conducting plates
from which two wires are brought out to suitable terminals. The plates
may be of any shape whatsoever, and are often separated by some
dielectric material. We illustrate such a situation schematically in
Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F2">22–2</a>. Again we make several simplifying assumptions.
We assume that the plates and the wires are perfect conductors. We also
assume that the insulation between the plates is perfect, so that no
charges can flow across the insulation from one plate to the other.
Next, we assume that the two conductors are close to each other but far
from all others, so that all field lines which leave one plate end up on
the other. Then there are always equal and opposite charges on the two
plates and the charges on the plates are much larger than the charges on
the surfaces of the lead-in wires. Finally, we assume that there are no
magnetic fields close to the capacitor.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-F2" class="figure">

<span class="tag">Fig. 22–2.</span>A capacitor (or condenser).
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-S1-p15" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose now we consider the line integral of $\FLPE$ around a closed
loop which starts at terminal $a$, goes along inside the wire to the
top plate of the capacitor, jumps across the space between the plates,
passes from the lower plate to terminal $b$ through the wire, and
returns to terminal $a$ in the space outside the capacitor. Since
there is no magnetic field, the line integral of $\FLPE$ around this
closed path is zero. The integral can be broken down into three parts:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:7}
\oint\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs=\kern{-1.3ex}
\underset{\substack{\text{along}\\\text{wires}}}{\int} % ebook insert: \kern -0.7ex 
\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs+\kern{-2.2ex}
\underset{\substack{\text{between}\\\text{plates}}}{\int}
\kern{-1.5ex}\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs+\kern{-1.2ex}
\underset{\text{outside}}{\int_b^a}
\kern{-1.6ex}\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation}
The integral along the wires is zero, because there are no electric
fields inside perfect conductors. The integral from $b$ to $a$ outside
the capacitor is equal to the negative of the potential difference
between the terminals. Since we imagined that the two plates are in
some way isolated from the rest of the world, the total charge on the
two plates must be zero; if there is a charge $Q$ on the upper plate,
there is an equal, opposite charge $-Q$ on the lower plate. We have
seen earlier that if two conductors have equal and opposite charges,
plus and minus $Q$, the potential difference between the plates is
equal to $Q/C$, where $C$ is called the capacity of the two
conductors. From Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII227">22.7</a>) the potential difference
between the terminals $a$ and $b$ is equal to the potential difference
between the plates. We have, therefore, that
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{Q}{C}.
\end{equation*}

The electric current $I$ entering the capacitor through terminal $a$
(and leaving through terminal $b$) is equal to $dQ/dt$, the rate of
change of the electric charge on the plates. Writing $dV/dt$
as $i\omega V$, we can put the voltage current relationship for a
capacitor in the following way:
\begin{equation}
i\omega V=\frac{I}{C},\notag
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:8}
V=\frac{I}{i\omega C}.
\end{equation}

The impedance $z$ of a capacitor, is then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:9}
z\,(\text{capacitor})=z_C=\frac{1}{i\omega C}.
\end{equation}

</div>
<div id="Ch22-S1-p16" class="para">
<p class="p">The third element we want to consider is a resistor.
However, since we have not yet discussed the electrical properties of
real materials, we are not yet ready to talk about what happens inside a
real conductor. We will just have to accept as fact that electric fields
can exist inside real materials, that these electric fields give rise to
a flow of electric charge—that is, to a current—and that this
current is proportional to the integral of the electric field from one
end of the conductor to the other. We then imagine an ideal resistor
constructed as in the diagram of Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F3">22–3</a>. Two wires which
we take to be perfect conductors go from the terminals $a$ and $b$ to
the two ends of a bar of resistive material. Following our usual line of
argument, the potential difference between the terminals $a$ and $b$ is
equal to the line integral of the external electric field, which is also
equal to the line integral of the electric field through the bar of
resistive material. It then follows that the current $I$ through the
resistor is proportional to the terminal voltage $V$:
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{V}{R},
\end{equation*}

where $R$ is called the resistance. We will see later that the
relation between the current and the voltage for real conducting
materials is only approximately linear. We will also see that this
approximate proportionality is expected to be independent of the
frequency of variation of the current and voltage only if the
frequency is not too high. For alternating currents then, the voltage
across a resistor is in phase with the current, which means that the
impedance is a real number:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:10}
z\,(\text{resistance})=z_R=R.

voltage across the terminals; so in a sense the elements “respond”
to the “applied” external conditions. For this reason these elements
are called <em class="emph">passive elements</em>. They can thus be

<div id="Ch22-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose that we have a coil like an inductance except that it has very
few turns, so that we may neglect the magnetic field of its own
current. This coil, however, sits in a changing magnetic field such as
might be produced by a rotating magnet, as sketched in
Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F5">22–5</a>. (We have seen earlier that such a rotating
magnetic field can also be produced by a suitable set of coils with
alternating currents.) Again we must make several simplifying
assumptions. The assumptions we will make are all the ones that we
described for the case of the inductance. In particular, we assume that
the varying magnetic field is restricted to a definite region in the
vicinity of the coil and does not appear outside the generator in the
space between the terminals.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Following closely the analysis we made for the inductance, we consider
the line integral of $\FLPE$ around a complete loop that starts at
terminal $a$, goes through the coil to terminal $b$ and returns to its
starting point in the space between the two terminals. Again we
conclude that the potential difference between the terminals is equal
to the total line integral of $\FLPE$ around the loop:
\begin{equation*}
V=-\oint\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation*}

This line integral is equal to the emf in the circuit, so the
potential difference $V$ across the terminals of the generator is also
equal to the rate of change of the magnetic flux linking the coil:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:11}
V=-\emf=\ddt{}{t}\,(\text{flux}).
\end{equation}

For an ideal generator we assume that the magnetic flux linking the
coil is determined by external conditions—such as the angular
velocity of a rotating magnetic field—and is not influenced in any
way by the currents through the generator. Thus a generator—at least
the <em class="emph">ideal</em> generator we are considering—is not an
impedance. The potential difference across its terminals is determined
by the arbitrarily assigned electromotive force $\emf(t)$. Such an ideal
generator is represented by the symbol shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F6">22–6</a>.
The little arrow represents the direction of the emf when it is
positive. A positive emf in the generator of Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F6">22–6</a> will
produce a voltage $V=\emf$, with the terminal $a$ at a higher potential

<p class="p">There is another way to make a generator which is quite different on
the inside but which is indistinguishable from the one we have just
described insofar as what happens beyond its terminals. Suppose we
have a coil of wire which is rotated in a <em class="emph">fixed</em> magnetic field,
as indicated in Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F7">22–7</a>. We show a bar magnet to
indicate the presence of a magnetic field; it could, of course, be
replaced by any other source of a steady magnetic field, such as an
additional coil carrying a steady current. As shown in the figure,
connections from the rotating coil are made to the outside world by
means of sliding contacts or “slip rings.” Again, we are interested
in the potential difference that appears across the two terminals $a$
and $b$, which is of course the integral of the electric field from
terminal $a$ to terminal $b$ along a path outside the generator.</p>

<p class="p">Now in the system of Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F7">22–7</a> there are no changing
magnetic fields, so we might at first wonder how any voltage could
appear at the generator terminals. In fact, there are no electric
fields anywhere inside the generator. We are, as usual, assuming for
our ideal elements that the wires inside are made of a perfectly
conducting material, and as we have said many times, the electric
field inside a perfect conductor is equal to zero. But that is not
true. It is not true when a conductor is moving in a magnetic
field. The true statement is that the total <em class="emph">force</em> on any charge
inside a perfect conductor must be zero. Otherwise there would be an
infinite flow of the free charges. So what is always true is that the
sum of the electric field $\FLPE$ and the cross product of the
velocity of the conductor and the magnetic field $\FLPB$—which is
the total force on a unit charge—must have the value zero inside the
conductor:
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:12}
\FLPF/\text{unit charge}=\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB=\FLPzero
\quad(\text{in a perfect conductor}),
\end{equation}
</span>
<span class="eq-narrow">
\begin{align}
\FLPF/\text{unit charge}&=\FLPE+\FLPv\times\FLPB\notag\\
\label{Eq:II:22:12}
&=\FLPzero\;(\text{in a perfect conductor}),
\end{align}
</span>
where $\FLPv$ represents the velocity of the conductor. Our earlier
statement that there is no electric field inside a perfect conductor
is all right if the velocity $\FLPv$ of the conductor is zero;
otherwise the correct statement is given by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2212">22.12</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-S2-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Returning to our generator of Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F7">22–7</a>, we now see
that the line integral of the electric field $\FLPE$ from terminal $a$
to terminal $b$ through the conducting path of the generator must be
equal to the line integral of $\FLPv\times\FLPB$ on the same path,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:13}
\underset{\substack{\text{inside}\\\text{conductor}}}{\int_a^b}
\kern{-1.75ex}\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs\;=-\kern{-1.75ex}
\underset{\substack{\text{inside}\\\text{conductor}}}{\int_a^b}
\kern{-1.5ex}(\FLPv\times\FLPB)\cdot d\FLPs.
\end{equation}

It is still true, however, that the line integral of $\FLPE$ around a
complete loop, including the return from $b$ to $a$ outside the
generator, must be zero, because there are no changing magnetic
fields. So the first integral in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2213">22.13</a>) is also
equal to $V$, the voltage between the two terminals. It turns out that
the right-hand integral of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2213">22.13</a>) is just the rate
of change of the flux linkage through the coil and is therefore—by
the flux rule—equal to the emf in the coil. So we have again that
the potential difference across the terminals is equal to the
electromotive force in the circuit, in agreement with
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2211">22.11</a>). So whether we have a generator in which a
magnetic field changes near a fixed coil, or one in which a coil moves
in a fixed magnetic field, the external properties of the generators are
the same. There is a voltage difference $V$ across the terminals, which
is independent of the current in the circuit but depends only on the
arbitrarily assigned conditions inside the generator.</p>

<p class="p">So long as we are trying to understand the operation of generators from
the point of view of Maxwell’s
equations, we might also ask about
the ordinary chemical cell, like a flashlight battery. It
is also a generator, i.e., a voltage source, although it will of course
only appear in <span class="text smallcaps">dc</span> circuits. The simplest kind of cell to
understand is shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F8">22–8</a>. We imagine two metal
plates immersed in some chemical solution. We suppose that the solution
contains positive and negative ions. We suppose also that one kind of
ion, say the negative, is much heavier than the one of opposite
polarity, so that its motion through the solution by the process of
diffusion is much slower. We suppose next that by some means or other it
is arranged that the concentration of the solution is made to vary from
one part of the liquid to the other, so that the number of ions of both
polarities near, say, the lower plate is much larger than the
concentration of ions near the upper plate. Because of their rapid
mobility the positive ions will drift more readily into the region of
lower concentration, so that there will be a slight excess of positive
charge arriving at the upper plate. The upper plate will become
positively charged and the lower plate will have a net negative charge.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">As more and more charges diffuse to the upper plate, the potential of
this plate will rise until the resulting electric field between the
plates produces forces on the ions which just compensate for their
excess mobility, so the two plates of the cell quickly reach a
potential difference which is characteristic of the internal
construction.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-S2-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Arguing just as we did for the ideal capacitor, we see that the
potential difference between the terminals $a$ and $b$ is just equal
to the line integral of the electric field between the two plates when
there is no longer any net diffusion of the ions. There is, of course,
an essential difference between a capacitor and such a chemical
cell. If we short-circuit the terminals of a condenser for a moment,
the capacitor is discharged and there is no longer any potential
difference across the terminals. In the case of the chemical cell a
current can be drawn from the terminals continuously without any
change in the emf—until, of course, the chemicals inside the cell
have been used up. In a real cell it is found that the potential
difference across the terminals decreases as the current drawn from
the cell increases. In keeping with the abstractions we have been
making, however, we may imagine an ideal cell in which the voltage
across the terminals is independent of the current. A real cell can
then be looked at as an ideal cell in series with a resistor.</p>

<div id="Ch22-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">As we have seen in the last section, the description of an ideal circuit
element in terms of what happens outside the element is quite simple.
The current and the voltage are linearly related. But what is actually
happening inside the element is quite complicated, and it is quite
difficult to give a precise description in terms of Maxwell’s
equations. Imagine trying to give a
precise description of the electric and magnetic fields of the inside of
a radio which contains hundreds of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
It would be an impossible task to analyze such a thing by using
Maxwell’s equations. But by
making the many approximations we have described in
Section <a href="#Ch22-S2">22–2</a> and summarizing the essential features of the
real circuit elements in terms of idealizations, it becomes possible to
analyze an electrical circuit in a relatively straightforward way. We
will now show how that is done.</p>

<p class="p">Suppose we have a circuit consisting of a generator and several
impedances connected together, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F9">22–9</a>.
According to our approximations there is no magnetic field in the region
outside the individual circuit elements. Therefore the line integral
of $\FLPE$ around any curve which does not pass through any of the elements
is zero. Consider then the curve $\Gamma$ shown by the broken line which
goes all the way around the circuit in Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F9">22–9</a>. The line
integral of $\FLPE$ around this curve is made up of several pieces. Each
piece is the line integral from one terminal of a circuit element to the
other. This line integral we have called the voltage drop across the
circuit element. The complete line integral is then just the sum of the
voltage drops across all of the elements in the circuit:
\begin{equation*}
\oint\FLPE\cdot d\FLPs=\sum V_n.
\end{equation*}

Since the line integral is zero, we have that the sum of the potential
differences around a complete loop of a circuit is equal to zero:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:14}
\underset{\substack{\text{around}\\\text{any loop}}}{\sum}
V_n=0.
\end{equation}

This result follows from one of Maxwell’s
equations—that in a region where
there are no magnetic fields the line integral of $\FLPE$ around any
complete loop is zero.

<p class="p">Now one of our idealizations has been that negligible electrical
charges accumulate on the terminals of the impedances. We now assume
further that any electrical charges on the wires joining terminals can
also be neglected. Then the conservation of charge requires that any
charge which leaves one circuit element immediately enters some other
circuit element. Or, what is the same thing, we require that the
algebraic sum of the currents which enter any given junction must be
zero. By a junction, of course, we mean any set of terminals such as
$a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ which are connected. Such a set of connected
terminals is usually called a “node.” The conservation of charge
then requires that for the circuit of Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F10">22–10</a>,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:15}
I_1-I_2-I_3-I_4=0.

The sum of the currents entering the node which consists of the four

\begin{equation}

<div id="Ch22-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose we consider the more complicated circuit of
Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F11">22–11</a>. How shall we find the currents and voltages in
this circuit? We can find them in the following straightforward way. We
consider separately each of the four subsidiary closed loops, which
appear in the circuit. (For instance, one loop goes from terminal $a$ to
terminal $b$ to terminal $e$ to terminal $d$ and back to terminal $a$.)
For each of the loops we write the equation for the first of Kirchhoff’s
rules—that the sum of the voltages around each loop is equal to zero.
We must remember to count the voltage drop as positive if we are going
<em class="emph">in</em> the direction of the current and negative if we are going
across an element in the direction <em class="emph">opposite</em> to the current; and
we must remember that the voltage drop across a generator is the
<em class="emph">negative</em> of the emf in that direction. Thus if we consider the
small loop that starts and ends at terminal $a$ we have the equation
\begin{equation*}
z_1I_1+z_3I_3+z_4I_4-\emf_1=0.
\end{equation*}

Applying the same rule to the remaining loops, we would get three more
equations of the same kind.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-S3-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Next, we must write the current equation for each of the nodes in the
circuit. For example, summing the currents into the node at terminal $b$
gives the equation
\begin{equation*}
I_1-I_3-I_2=0.
\end{equation*}

Similarly, for the node labeled $e$ we would have the current equation
\begin{equation*}
I_3-I_4+I_8-I_5=0.
\end{equation*}

For the circuit shown there are five such current equations. It turns
out, however, that any one of these equations can be derived from the
other four; there are, therefore, only four independent current
equations. We thus have a total of eight independent, linear
equations: the four voltage equations and the four current
equations. With these eight equations we can solve for the eight
unknown currents. Once the currents are known the circuit is
solved. The voltage drop across any element is given by the current
through that element times its impedance (or, in the case of the
voltage sources, it is already known).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch22-S3-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">We have seen that when we write the current equations, we get one
equation which is not independent of the others. Generally it is also
possible to write down too many voltage equations. For example, in the
circuit of Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F11">22–11</a>, although we have considered only
the four small loops, there are a large number of other loops for
which we could write the voltage equation. There is, for example, the
loop along the path $abcfeda$. There is another loop which follows the
path $abcfehgda$. You can see that there are many loops. In analyzing
complicated circuits it is very easy to get too many equations. There
are rules which tell us how to proceed so that only the minimum number
of equations is written down, but usually with a little thought it is
possible to see how to get the right number of equations in the
simplest form. Besides, writing an extra equation or two doesn’t do
any harm. They will not lead to any wrong answers, only perhaps a
little unnecessary algebra.</p>

<p class="p">In Chapter <a href="I_25.html">25</a> of Vol. I we showed that if the two

to a single impedance $z_s$ given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:18}
z_s=z_1+z_2.

We also showed that if the two impedances are connected in
<em class="emph">parallel</em>, they are equivalent to the single impedance $z_p$
given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:19}
z_p=\frac{1}{(1/z_1)+(1/z_2)}=\frac{z_1z_2}{z_1+z_2}.
\end{equation}

If you look back you will see that in deriving these results we were
in effect making use of Kirchhoff’s rules. It is often possible to
analyze a complicated circuit by repeated application of the formulas
for series and parallel impedances. For instance, the circuit of
Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F12">22–12</a> can be analyzed that way. First, the
impedances $z_4$ and $z_5$ can be replaced by their parallel
equivalent, and so also can $z_6$ and $z_7$. Then the impedance $z_2$
can be combined with the parallel equivalent of $z_6$ and $z_7$ by the
series rule. Proceeding in this way, the whole circuit can be reduced
to a generator in series with a single impedance $Z$. The current
through the generator is then just $\emf/Z$. Then by working backward
one can solve for the currents in each of the impedances.</p>

<p class="p">There are, however, quite simple circuits which cannot be analyzed by
this method, as for example the circuit of Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F13">22–13</a>. To
analyze this circuit we must write down the current and voltage
equations from Kirchhoff’s rules. Let’s do it. There is just one current
equation:
\begin{equation*}
I_1+I_2+I_3=0,
\end{equation*}

so we know immediately that
\begin{equation*}
I_3=-(I_1+I_2).
\end{equation*}

We can save ourselves some algebra if we immediately make use of this
result in writing the voltage equations. For this circuit there are
two independent voltage equations; they are
\begin{equation*}
-\emf_1+I_2z_2-I_1z_1=0
\end{equation*}

and
\begin{equation*}
\emf_2-(I_1+I_2)z_3-I_2z_2=0.
\end{equation*}

There are two equations and two unknown currents. Solving these
equations for $I_1$ and $I_2$, we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:20}
I_1=\frac{z_2\emf_2-(z_2+z_3)\emf_1}{z_1(z_2+z_3)+z_2z_3}

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:21}
I_2=\frac{z_1\emf_2+z_3\emf_1}{z_1(z_2+z_3)+z_2z_3}.

The third current is obtained from the sum of these two.</p>

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:22}
V_n=A-BI_n,

where $A$ and $B$ depend on the generators and impedances in the

analyzed in terms of series and parallel combinations. Suppose we
start with the circuit of Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F18">22–18</a>(a). We can see
right away that the impedance from terminal $a$ to terminal $b$ is
simply $z_1+z_2$. Now let’s take a little harder circuit, the one
shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F18">22–18</a>(b). We could analyze this circuit
using Kirchhoff’s rules,
but it is also easy to handle with series and
parallel combinations. We can replace the two impedances on the

the figure. Then the two impedances $z_2$ and $z_3$ can be replaced by
their equivalent parallel impedance $z_4$, as shown in part (d) of the

<p class="p">Now we may ask an amusing question: What would happen if in the network of
Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F18">22–18</a>(b) we kept on adding more sections <em class="emph">forever</em>—as
we indicate by the dashed lines in Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F19">22–19</a>(a)?  Can we solve
such an infinite network? Well, that’s not so hard. First, we notice that such
an infinite network is unchanged if we add one more section at the “front”
end. Surely, if we add one more section to an infinite network it is still the
same infinite network. Suppose we call the impedance between the two terminals
$a$ and $b$ of the infinite network $z_0$; then the impedance of all the stuff
to the right of the two terminals $c$ and $d$ is also $z_0$. Therefore, so far
as the front end is concerned, we can represent the network as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F19">22–19</a>(b). Forming the parallel combination of $z_2$ with $z_0$
and adding the result in series with $z_1$, we can immediately write down the
impedance of this circuit:
\begin{equation*}
z=z_1\!+\!\frac{1}{(1/z_2)\!+\!(1/z_0)}\quad\text{or}\quad
z=z_1\!+\!\frac{z_2z_0}{z_2\!+\!z_0}.
\end{equation*}

But this impedance is also equal to $z_0$, so we have the equation
\begin{equation}
z_0=z_1+\frac{z_2z_0}{z_2+z_0}.\notag
\end{equation}

We can solve for $z_0$ to get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:27}
z_0=\frac{z_1}{2}+\sqrt{(z_1^2/4)+z_1z_2}.
\end{equation}

So we have found the solution for the impedance of an infinite ladder
of repeated series and parallel impedances. The impedance $z_0$ is
called the <em class="emph">characteristic impedance</em> of such an infinite
network.</p>

therefore seem more natural, or at least somewhat simpler, if we were

impedance is a pure resistance for frequencies below $\sqrt{4/LC}$?
For higher frequencies the impedance is purely imaginary, in agreement
with our earlier statement. For lower frequencies the impedance is a
pure resistance and will therefore absorb energy. But how can the
circuit continuously absorb energy, as a resistance does, if it is
made only of inductances and capacitances? <em class="emph">Answer:</em> Because
there is an infinite number of inductances and capacitances, so that
when a source is connected to the circuit, it supplies energy to the
first inductance and capacitance, then to the second, to the third,
and so on. In a circuit of this kind, energy is continually absorbed
from the generator at a constant rate and flows constantly out into
the network, supplying energy which is stored in the inductances and
capacitances down the line.</p>

<p class="p">This idea suggests an interesting point about what is happening in the
circuit. We would expect that if we connect a source to the front end,
the effects of this source will be propagated through the network
toward the infinite end. The propagation of the waves down the line is
much like the radiation from an antenna which absorbs energy from its
driving source; that is, we expect such a propagation to occur when
the impedance is real, which occurs if $\omega$ is less

happens for $\omega$ greater than $\sqrt{4/LC}$, we would not expect

<p class="p">We saw in the last section that the infinite ladder network of

will call the <em class="emph">cutoff frequency</em> $\omega_0$. We
suggested that this
effect could be understood in terms of a continuous transport of energy
down the line. On the other hand, at high frequencies, for $w&gt;\omega_0$,
there is no continuous absorption of energy; we should then expect that
perhaps the currents don’t “penetrate” very far down the line. Let’s

<p class="p">Suppose we have the front end of the ladder connected to some
<span class="text smallcaps">ac</span> generator and we ask what the voltage looks like at, say,
the $754$th section of the ladder. Since the network is infinite,
whatever happens to the voltage from one section to the next is always
the same; so let’s just look at what happens when we go from some
section, say the $n$th to the next. We will define the currents $I_n$

<div id="Ch22-S7-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We can get the voltage $V_{n+1}$ from $V_n$ by remembering that we can
always replace the rest of the ladder after the $n$th section by its
characteristic impedance $z_0$; then we need only analyze the circuit
of Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F21">22–21</a>(b). First, we notice that any $V_n$,
since it is across $z_0$, must equal $I_nz_0$. Also, the difference
between $V_n$ and $V_{n+1}$ is just $I_nz_1$:
\begin{equation*}
V_n-V_{n+1}=I_nz_1=V_n\,\frac{z_1}{z_0}.
\end{equation*}
So we get the ratio
\begin{equation*}
\frac{V_{n+1}}{V_n}=1-\frac{z_1}{z_0}=\frac{z_0-z_1}{z_0}.
\end{equation*}
We can call this ratio the <em class="emph">propagation factor</em> for one section of the 
ladder; we’ll call it&nbsp;$\alpha$. It is, of course, the same for all sections:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:29}
\alpha=\frac{z_0-z_1}{z_0}.
\end{equation}
The voltage after the $n$th section is then
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:30}
V_n=\alpha^n\emf.
\end{equation}
You can now find the voltage after $754$&nbsp;sections; it is just $\alpha$
to the $754$th power times&nbsp;$\emf$.

\alpha=\frac{\sqrt{(L/C)-(\omega^2L^2/4)}-i(\omega L/2)}
{\sqrt{(L/C)-(\omega^2L^2/4)}+i(\omega L/2)}.
\end{equation}
If the driving frequency is below the cutoff
frequency&nbsp;$\omega_0=\sqrt{4/LC}$, the radical is a real number, and the
magnitudes of the complex numbers in the numerator and denominator are
equal. Therefore, the magnitude of&nbsp;$\alpha$ is one; we can write
\begin{equation*}
\alpha=e^{i\delta},
\end{equation*}
which means that the magnitude of the voltage is the same at every
section; only its phase changes. The phase change&nbsp;$\delta$ is, in
fact, a negative number and represents the “delay” of the voltage as
it passes along the network.

</div>

<div id="Ch22-S7-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">For frequencies above the cutoff frequency&nbsp;$\omega_0$ it is better to

\end{equation}
The propagation factor&nbsp;$\alpha$ is now a <em class="emph">real</em> number, and a
number <em class="emph">less than one</em>. That means that the voltage at any
section is always less than the voltage at the preceding section by
the factor&nbsp;$\alpha$. For any frequency above&nbsp;$\omega_0$, the voltage
dies away rapidly as we go along the network. A plot of the absolute
value of&nbsp;$\alpha$ as a function of frequency looks like the graph in

network “passes” low frequencies and “rejects” or “filters out”
the high frequencies. Any network designed to have its characteristics

which obviously cannot actually occur. The point is that the same

Now in practice it is not possible to <em class="emph">exactly</em> reproduce
the characteristic impedance with a few simple elements—like
$R$’s, $L$’s, and $C$’s. But it is often possible to do so with a fair
approximation for a certain range of frequencies. In this way one can
make a finite filter network whose properties are very nearly the same
as those for the infinite case. For instance, the $L$-$C$ ladder
behaves much as we have described it if it is terminated in the pure

some purposes as the band-pass filter. You will remember
(Chapter <a href="I_48.html">48</a>, Vol. I) that when a carrier of
frequency $\omega_c$ is modulated with a “signal” frequency $\omega_s$, the
total signal contains not only the carrier frequency but also the two
side-band frequencies $\omega_c+\omega_s$ and $\omega_c-\omega_s$. With
a resonant filter, these side-bands are always attenuated somewhat, and
the attenuation is more, the higher the signal frequency, as you can see
from the figure. So there is a poor “frequency response.” The higher
musical tones don’t get through. But if the filtering is done with a
band-pass filter designed so that the width $\omega_2-\omega_1$ is at
least twice the highest signal frequency, the frequency response will be
“flat” for the signals wanted.</p>

<p class="p">We want to make one more point about the ladder filter: the $L$-$C$
ladder of Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F20">22–20</a> is also an approximate
representation of a transmission line. If we have a long conductor
that runs parallel to another conductor—such as a wire in a coaxial
cable, or a wire suspended above the earth—there will be some
capacitance between the two conductors and also some inductance due to
the magnetic field between them. If we imagine the line as broken up
into small lengths $\Delta\ell$, each length will look like one
section of the $L$-$C$ ladder with a series inductance $\Delta L$ and
a shunt capacitance $\Delta C$. We can then use our results for the
ladder filter. If we take the limit as $\Delta\ell$ goes to zero, we
have a good description of the transmission line. Notice that
as $\Delta\ell$ is made smaller and smaller, both $\Delta L$ and $\Delta
C$ decrease, but in the same proportion, so that the ratio $\Delta
L/\Delta C$ remains constant. So if we take the limit of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2228">22.28</a>) as $\Delta L$ and $\Delta C$ go to zero, we find
that the characteristic impedance $z_0$ is a pure resistance whose
magnitude is $\sqrt{\Delta L/\Delta C}$. We can also write the
ratio $\Delta L/\Delta C$ as $L_0/C_0$, where $L_0$ and $C_0$ are the
inductance and capacitance of a unit length of the line; then we have

voltage generator. We want now to show that other elements, such as
mutual inductances or transistors or vacuum tubes, can be described by
using only the same basic elements. Suppose that we have two coils and
that on purpose, or otherwise, some flux from one of the coils links
the other, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F26">22–26</a>(a). Then the two coils
will have a mutual inductance $M$ such that when the
current varies in one of the coils, there will be a voltage generated in
the other. Can we take into account such an effect in our equivalent
circuits? We can in the following way. We have seen that the induced
emf’s in each of two interacting coils can be written as the sum of two
parts:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:34}
\begin{aligned}
\emf_1&=-L_1\,\ddt{I_1}{t}\pm M\,\ddt{I_2}{t},\\[1.5ex]
\emf_2&=-L_2\,\ddt{I_2}{t}\pm M\,\ddt{I_1}{t}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The first term comes from the self-inductance of the coil, and the
second term comes from its mutual inductance with the other coil. The
sign of the second term can be plus or minus, depending on the way the
flux from one coil links the other. Making the same approximations we
used in describing an ideal inductance, we would say that the potential
difference across the terminals of each coil is equal to the
electromotive force in the coil. Then the two equations
of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII2234">22.34</a>) are the same as the ones we would get from the
circuit of Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F26">22–26</a>(b), provided the electromotive force
in each of the two circuits shown depends on the current in the opposite
circuit according to the relations
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:22:35}
\emf_1=\pm i\omega MI_2,\quad
\emf_2=\pm i\omega MI_1.
\end{equation}

So what we can do is represent the effect of the self-inductance in a
normal way but replace the effect of the mutual inductance by an auxiliary ideal
voltage generator. We must in addition, of course, have the equation
that relates this emf to the current in some other part of the circuit;
but so long as this equation is linear, we have just added more linear
equations to our circuit equations, and all of our earlier conclusions
about equivalent circuits and so forth are still correct.</p>

<p class="p">In addition to mutual inductances there may also be mutual
capacitances.
So far, when we have talked about condensers we have always imagined
that there were only two electrodes, but in many situations, for example
in a vacuum tube, there may be many electrodes close to each other. If
we put an electric charge on any one of the electrodes, its electric
field will induce charges on each of the other electrodes and affect its
potential. As an example, consider the arrangement of four plates shown
in Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F27">22–27</a>(a). Suppose these four plates are connected
to external circuits by means of the wires $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. So
long as we are only worried about electrostatic effects, the equivalent
circuit of such an arrangement of electrodes is as shown in part (b) of
the figure. The electrostatic interaction of any electrode with each of
the others is equivalent to a capacity between the two electrodes.

<p class="p">Finally, let’s consider how we should represent such complicated
devices as transistors and radio tubes in an <span class="text smallcaps">ac</span> circuit. We
should point out at the start that such devices are often operated in
such a way that the relationship between the currents and voltages is
not at all linear. In such cases, those statements we have made which
depend on the linearity of equations are, of course, no longer
correct. On the other hand, in many applications the operating
characteristics are sufficiently linear that we may consider the
transistors and tubes to be linear devices. By this we mean that the
alternating currents in, say, the plate of a vacuum tube are linearly
proportional to the voltages that appear on the other electrodes, say
the grid voltage and the plate voltage. When we have such linear
relationships, we can incorporate the device into our equivalent
circuit representation.</p>

<p class="p">As in the case of the mutual inductance, our representation will have to
include auxiliary voltage generators which describe the influence of the
voltages or currents in one part of the device on the currents or
voltages in another part. For example, the plate circuit of a triode can
usually be represented by a resistance in series with an ideal voltage
generator whose source strength is proportional to the grid voltage. We
get the equivalent circuit shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F28">22–28</a>.<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a> Similarly, the collector
circuit of a transistor is conveniently represented as a resistor in
series with an ideal voltage generator whose source strength is
proportional to the current from the emitter to the base of the
transistor. The equivalent circuit is then like that in
Fig. <a href="#Ch22-F29">22–29</a>. So long as the equations which describe the
operation are linear, we can use such representations for tubes or
transistors. Then, when they are incorporated in a complicated network,
our general conclusions about the equivalent representation of any
arbitrary connection of elements is still valid.</p>

<p class="p">There is one remarkable thing about transistor and radio tube circuits
which is different from circuits containing only impedances: the real
part of the effective impedance $z_{\text{eff}}$ can become
negative. We have seen that the real part of $z$ represents the loss
of energy. But it is the important characteristic of transistors and
tubes that they <em class="emph">supply</em> energy to the circuit. (Of course they
don’t just “make” energy; they take energy from the <span class="text smallcaps">dc</span>
circuits of the power supplies and convert it into <span class="text smallcaps">ac</span>
energy.) So it is possible to have a circuit with a negative
resistance. Such a circuit has the property that if you connect it to
an impedance with a positive real part, i.e., a positive resistance,
and arrange matters so that the sum of the two real parts is exactly
zero, then there is no dissipation in the combined circuit. If there
is no loss of energy, any alternating voltage once started will remain
forever. This is the basic idea behind the operation of an oscillator
or signal generator which can be used as a source of alternating
voltage at any desired frequency.</p>

  There are people who say we should call the
<em class="emph">objects</em> by the names “inductor” and “capacitor” and call
their <em class="emph">properties</em> “inductance” and “capacitance” (by analogy
with “resistor” and “resistance”). We would rather use the words you
will hear in the laboratory. Most people still say “inductance” for
both the physical coil and its inductance $L$. The word “capacitor”
seems to have caught on—although you will still hear “condenser”
fairly often—and most people still prefer the sound of “capacity” to
“capacitance.”

  The equivalent circuit shown is
correct only for low frequencies. For high frequencies the equivalent
circuit gets much more complicated and will include various so-called
“parasitic” capacitances and inductances.
