<p class="p">In this chapter we will discuss some materials in which the net
effect
of the magnetic moments in the material is much greater than in the
case of paramagnetism or diamagnetism. The phenomenon is called
<em class="emph">ferromagnetism</em>. In paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials the
induced magnetic moments are usually so weak that we don’t have to
worry about the additional fields produced by the magnetic
moments. For <em class="emph">ferromagnetic</em> materials, however, the magnetic
moments induced by applied magnetic fields are quite enormous and have
a great effect on the fields themselves. In fact, the induced moments
are so strong that they are often the dominant effect in producing the
observed fields. So one of the things we will have to worry about is
the mathematical theory of large induced magnetic moments. That is, of
course, just a technical question. The real problem is, why are the
magnetic moments so strong—how does it all work? We will come to
that question in a little while.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Finding the magnetic fields of ferromagnetic materials is something like
the problem of finding the electrostatic field in the presence of
dielectrics. You will remember that we first described the internal
properties of a dielectric in terms of a vector field $\FLPP$, the
dipole moment per unit volume. Then we figured out that the effects of
this polarization are equivalent to a charge density $\rho_{\text{pol}}$
given by the divergence of $\FLPP$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:1}
\rho_{\text{pol}}=-\FLPdiv{\FLPP}.
\end{equation}

The total charge in any situation can be written as the sum of this
polarization charge plus all other charges, whose density we
write<a name="footnote_source_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup class="mark">1</sup></a> $\rho_{\text{other}}$. Then the Maxwell
equation
which relates the divergence of $\FLPE$ to the charge density becomes
\begin{equation*}
\FLPdiv{\FLPE}=\frac{\rho}{\epsO}=
\frac{\rho_{\text{pol}}+\rho_{\text{other}}}{\epsO},
\end{equation*}

or
\begin{equation*}
\FLPdiv{\FLPE}=-\frac{\FLPdiv{\FLPP}}{\epsO}+
\frac{\rho_{\text{other}}}{\epsO}.
\end{equation*}

We can then pull out the polarization part of the charge and put it on
the other side of the equation, to get the new law
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:2}
\FLPdiv{(\epsO\FLPE+\FLPP)}=\rho_{\text{other}}.
\end{equation}

The new law says the divergence of the quantity $(\epsO\FLPE+\FLPP)$
is equal to the density of the other charges.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S1-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Pulling $\FLPE$ and $\FLPP$ together as in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII362">36.2</a>),
of course, is useful only if we know some relation between them. We
have seen that the theory which relates the induced electric dipole
moment to the field was a relatively complicated business and can
really only be applied to certain simple situations, and even then as
an approximation. We would like to remind you of one of the
approximate ideas we used. To find the induced dipole moment of an
atom inside a dielectric, it is necessary to know the electric field
that acts on an individual atom. We made the approximation—which is
not too bad in many cases—that the field on the atom is the same as
it would be at the center of the small hole which would be left if we
took out the atom (keeping the dipole moments of all the neighboring
atoms the same). You will also remember that the electric field in a
hole in a polarized dielectric depends on the shape of the hole. We
summarize our earlier results in Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F1">36–1</a>. For a thin, disc-shaped
hole perpendicular to the polarization, the electric field in the hole
is given by
\begin{equation*}
\FLPE_{\text{hole}}=\FLPE_{\text{dielectric}}+\frac{\FLPP}{\epsO},
\end{equation*}

which we showed by using Gauss’ law. On the other hand, in a
needle-shaped slot parallel to the polarization, we showed—by using
the fact that the curl of $\FLPE$ is zero—that the electric fields
inside and outside of the slot are the same. Finally, we found that
for a spherical hole the electric field was one-third of the way
between the field of the slot and the field of the disc:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:3}
\FLPE_{\text{hole}}=\FLPE_{\text{dielectric}}+\frac{1}{3}\,
\frac{\FLPP}{\epsO}\:(\text{spherical hole}).
\end{equation}

This was the field we used in thinking about what happens to an atom
inside a polarized dielectric.</p>

<div id="Ch36-S1-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we have to discuss the analog of all this for the case of
magnetism. One simple, short-cut way of doing this is to say the
$\FLPM$, the magnetic moment per unit volume, is just like $\FLPP$,
the electric dipole moment per unit volume, and that, therefore, the
negative of the divergence of $\FLPM$ is equivalent to a “magnetic
charge density” $\rho_m$—whatever that may mean. The trouble is, of
course, that there isn’t any such thing as a “magnetic charge” in
the physical world. As we know, the divergence of $\FLPB$ is always
zero. But that does not stop us from making an artificial
<em class="emph">analog</em> and writing
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:4}
\FLPdiv{\FLPM}=-\rho_m,
\end{equation}

where it is to be understood that $\rho_m$ is purely
mathematical. Then we could make a complete analogy with the
electrostatic case and use all our old equations from
electrostatics. People have often done something like that. In fact,
historically, people even believed that the analogy was right. They
believed that the quantity $\rho_m$ represented the density of
“magnetic poles.” These days, however, we know that the
magnetization of materials comes from circulating currents within the
atoms—either from the spinning electrons or from the motion of the
electrons in the atom. It is therefore nicer from a physical point of
view to describe things realistically in terms of the atomic
currents, rather
than in terms of a density of some mythical “magnetic poles.”
Incidentally, these currents are sometimes called “Ampèrian”
currents, because
Ampère first suggested that the magnetism of matter came from
circulating atomic currents.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">The actual microscopic current density in magnetized matter is, of
course, very complicated. Its value depends on where you look in the
atom—it’s large in some places and small in others; it goes one way
in one part of the atom and the opposite way in another part (just as
the microscopic electric field varies enormously inside a
dielectric). In many practical problems, however, we are interested
only in the fields outside of the matter or in the <em class="emph">average</em>
magnetic field inside of the matter—where we mean an average taken
over many, many atoms. It is only for such <em class="emph">macroscopic</em> problems
that it is convenient to describe the magnetic state of the matter in
terms of $\FLPM$, the average dipole moment per unit volume. What we
want to show now is that the atomic currents of magnetized matter can give
rise to certain large-scale currents which are related to $\FLPM$.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">What we are going to do, then, is to separate the current
density $\FLPj$—which is the real source of the magnetic fields—into
various parts: one part to describe the circulating currents of the
atomic magnets, and the other parts to describe what other currents
there may be. It is usually most convenient to separate the currents
into three parts. In Chapter <a href="II_32.html">32</a> we made a distinction
between the currents which flow freely on conductors and the ones
which are due to the back and forth motions of the bound charges in
dielectrics. In Section <a href="II_32.html#Ch32-S2">32–2</a> we wrote
\begin{equation*}
\FLPj=\FLPj_{\text{pol}}+\FLPj_{\text{other}},
\end{equation*}

where $\FLPj_{\text{pol}}$ represented the currents from the motion of
the bound charges in dielectrics and $\FLPj_{\text{other}}$ took care
of all other currents. Now we want to go further. We want to separate
$\FLPj_{\text{other}}$ into one part, $\FLPj_{\text{mag}}$, which
describes the average currents inside of magnetized materials, and an
additional term which we can call $\FLPj_{\text{cond}}$ for whatever
is left over. The last term will generally refer to currents in
conductors, but it may also include other currents—for example the
currents from charges moving freely through empty space. So we will
write for the total current density:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:5}
\FLPj=\FLPj_{\text{pol}}+\FLPj_{\text{mag}}+\FLPj_{\text{cond}}.
\end{equation}

Of course it is this total current which belongs in the Maxwell
equation
for the curl of $\FLPB$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:6}
c^2\FLPcurl{\FLPB}=\frac{\FLPj}{\epsO}+\ddp{\FLPE}{t}.
\end{equation}

</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S1-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we have to relate the current $\FLPj_{\text{mag}}$ to the
magnetization vector $\FLPM$. So that you can see where we are going,
we will tell you that the result is going to be that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:7}
\FLPj_{\text{mag}}=\FLPcurl{\FLPM}.
\end{equation}

If we are given the magnetization vector $\FLPM$ everywhere in a
magnetic material, the circulation current density is given by the
curl of $\FLPM$. Let’s see if we can understand why this is so.</p>

<span class="tag">Fig. 36–2.</span>Schematic diagram of the circulating atomic currents as seen in
a cross section of an iron rod magnetized in the $z$-direction.
</div>
</div>

<div id="Ch36-S1-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">First, let’s take the case of a cylindrical rod which has a uniform
magnetization parallel to its axis. Physically, we know that such a
uniform magnetization really means a uniform density of atomic
circulating currents everywhere inside the material. Suppose we try to imagine what
the actual currents would look like in a cross section of the material.
We would expect to see currents something like those shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F2">36–2</a>. Each atomic current goes around and around in a
little circle, with all the circulating currents going around in the
same direction. Now what is the effective current of such a thing? Well,
in most of the bar there is no effect at all, because right next to each
current there is another current going in the opposite direction. If we
imagine a small surface—but one still quite a bit larger than a single
atom—such as is indicated in Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F2">36–2</a> by the
line $\overline{AB}$, the net current through such a surface is zero.
There is no net current anywhere inside the material. Note, however,
that at the surface of the material there are atomic
currents which are
not cancelled by neighboring currents going the other way. At the
surface there is a net current always going in the same direction around
the rod. Now you see why we said earlier that a uniformly magnetized rod
is equivalent to a long solenoid carrying an electric current.

</div>

<div id="Ch36-S1-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">How does this view fit with Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII367">36.7</a>)? First, inside the
material the magnetization $\FLPM$ is constant, so all its derivatives
are zero. This agrees with our geometric picture. At the surface,
however, $\FLPM$ is not really constant—it is constant up to the edge
and then suddenly collapses to zero. So, right at the surface there are
terrific gradients which, according to (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII367">36.7</a>), will give a
high current density. Suppose we look at what happens near the point $C$
in Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F2">36–2</a>. Taking the $x$- and $y$-directions as in the
figure, the magnetization $\FLPM$ is in the $z$-direction. Writing out
the components of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII367">36.7</a>), we have
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\ddp{M_z}{y}&=(j_{\text{mag}})_x,\\[1ex]
-\ddp{M_z}{x}&=(j_{\text{mag}})_y.
\end{aligned}
\label{Eq:II:36:8}
\end{equation}

At the point $C$, the derivative $\ddpl{M_z}{y}$ is zero, but
$\ddpl{M_z}{x}$ is large and positive. Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII367">36.7</a>)
says that there is a large current density in the minus
$y$-direction. This agrees with our picture of a surface current going
around the bar.</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch36-S1-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we want to find the current density for a more complicated case in
which the magnetization varies from point to point in a material. It
is easy to see qualitatively that if the magnetization is different in
two neighboring regions, there will not be a perfect cancellation of
the circulating currents so that there will be a net current in the
volume of the material. It is this effect that we want to work out
quantitatively.

<div id="Ch36-S1-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">First, we need to recall the results of Section <a href="II_14.html#Ch14-S5">14–5</a>
that a circulating current $I$ has a magnetic moment $\mu$ given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:9}
\mu=IA,
\end{equation}

where $A$ is the area of the current loop (see Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F3">36–3</a>).
Now let’s consider a small rectangular block inside of a magnetized
material, as sketched in Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F4">36–4</a>. We take the block so
small that we can consider that the magnetization is uniform inside it.
If this block has a magnetization $M_z$ in the $z$-direction, the net
effect will be the same as a surface current going around on the
vertical faces, as shown. We can find the magnitude of these currents
from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII369">36.9</a>). The total magnetic moment of the block is
equal to the magnetization times the volume:
\begin{equation*}
\mu=M_z(abc),
\end{equation*}

from which we get (remembering that the area of the loop is $ac$)
\begin{equation*}
I=M_zb.
\end{equation*}

In other words, the current per unit length (vertically) on each of
the vertical surfaces is equal to $M_z$.</p>

there is a net surface current in between.

</div>

<div id="Ch36-S1-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">Now suppose that we imagine two such little blocks next to each other,
as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F5">36–5</a>. Because block $2$ is slightly
displaced from block $1$, it will have a slightly different vertical
component of magnetization, which we call $M_z+\Delta M_z$. Now on the
surface between the two blocks there will be two contributions to the
total current. Block $1$ will produce a current $I_1$ flowing in the
positive $y$-direction, and block $2$ will produce a surface
current $I_2$ flowing in the negative $y$-direction. The total surface current
in the positive $y$-direction is the sum:
\begin{align*}
I&=I_1-I_2=M_zb-(M_z+\Delta M_z)b\\[1ex]
&=-\Delta M_zb.
\end{align*}

We can write $\Delta M_z$, as the derivative of $M_z$ in the
$x$-direction times the displacement from block $1$ to block $2$,
which is just $a$:
\begin{equation*}
\Delta M_z=\ddp{M_z}{x}\,a.
\end{equation*}

The current flowing between the two blocks is then
\begin{equation*}
I=-\ddp{M_z}{x}\,ab.
\end{equation*}

To relate the current $I$ to an average volume current
density $\FLPj$, we must realize that this current $I$ is really spread over a
certain cross-sectional area. If we imagine the whole volume of the
material to be filled with such little blocks, one such side face
(perpendicular to the $x$-axis) can be associated with each
block.<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a> Then we see
that the area to be associated with the current $I$ is just the
area $ab$ of one of the front faces. We get the result
\begin{equation*}
j_y=\frac{I}{ab}=-\ddp{M_z}{x}.
\end{equation*}

We have at least the beginning of the curl of $\FLPM$.</p>

<div id="Ch36-S1-p13" class="para">
<p class="p">There should be another term in $j_y$ from the variation of the
$x$-component of the magnetization with $z$. This contribution
to $\FLPj$ will come from the surface between two little blocks stacked
one on top of the other, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F6">36–6</a>. Using the same
arguments we have just made, you can show that this surface will
contribute to $j_y$ the amount $\ddpl{M_x}{z}$. These are the only
surfaces which can contribute to the $y$-component of the current so
we have that the total current density in the $y$-direction is
\begin{equation*}
j_y=\ddp{M_x}{z}-\ddp{M_z}{x}.
\end{equation*}

Working out the currents on the remaining faces of a cube—or using
the fact that our $z$-direction is completely arbitrary—we can
conclude that the vector current density is indeed given by the
equation
\begin{equation*}
\FLPj=\FLPcurl{\FLPM}.

addition, a polarization current $\FLPj_{\text{pol}}=\ddpl{\FLPP}{t}$. And if
the material is also a conductor, we may have a conduction
current $\FLPj_{\text{cond}}$ as well. We can write the total current as

As we remarked in Chapter <a href="II_32.html">32</a>, many people like to

it is often convenient to write $(\FLPB-\FLPM/\epsO c^2)$ as a single
vector field. <em class="emph">We</em> choose to define a new vector field $\FLPH$ by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:12}
\FLPH=\FLPB-\frac{\FLPM}{\epsO c^2}.

Then Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3611">36.11</a>) becomes

It looks simple, but all the complexity is just hidden in the letters
$\FLPD$ and $\FLPH$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S2-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we have to give you a warning. Most people who use the mks units
have chosen to use a different definition of $\FLPH$. Calling
<em class="emph">their</em> field $\FLPH'$ (of course, they still call it $\FLPH$
without the prime), it is defined by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:14}
\FLPH'=\epsO c^2\FLPB-\FLPM.
\end{equation}

(Also, they usually write $\epsO c^2$ as a new number $1/\mu_0$; then
they have one more constant to keep track of!) With this definition,
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3613">36.13</a>) looks even simpler:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:15}
\FLPcurl{\FLPH'}=\FLPj_{\text{cond}}+\ddp{\FLPD}{t}.
\end{equation}

But the difficulties with this definition of $\FLPH'$ are, first, that
it doesn’t agree with the definition of people who don’t use the mks
units, and second, that it makes $\FLPH'$ and $\FLPB$ have different
units. We think it is more convenient for $\FLPH$ to have the same units
as $\FLPB$—rather than the units of $\FLPM$, as $\FLPH'$ does. But if
you are going to be an engineer and work on the design of transformers,
magnets, and such, you will have to watch out. You will find many books
which use for $\FLPH$ the definition of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3614">36.14</a>) rather
than our definition of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3612">36.12</a>), and many other
books—especially handbooks about magnetic materials—that relate
$\FLPB$ and $\FLPH$ the way we have done. You’ll have to be careful to
figure out which convention they are using.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">One way to tell is by the units they use. Remember that in the mks
system, $\FLPB$—and therefore <em class="emph">our</em> $\FLPH$—are measured with
the unit: one weber per square meter, equal to $10{,}000$ gauss. In the
mks system, a magnetic moment (a current times an area) has the unit:
one ampere-meter$^2$. The magnetization $\FLPM$, then, has the unit: one
ampere <em class="emph">per</em> meter. For $\FLPH'$ the units are the same as
for $\FLPM$. You can see that this also agrees with Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3615">36.15</a>),
since $\FLPnabla$ has the dimensions of one over a length. People who
are working with electromagnets also get in the habit of calling the
unit of $\FLPH$ (with the $\FLPH'$ definition) “one ampere <em class="emph">turn</em>
per meter”—thinking of the turns of wire on a winding. But a “turn”
is really a dimensionless number, so that doesn’t need to confuse you.
Since our $H$ is equal to $H'/\epsO c^2$, if you are using the mks
system, $H$ (in webers/meter$^2$) is equal to $4\pi\times10^{-7}$
times $H'$ (in amperes per meter). It is perhaps more convenient to remember
that $H$ (in gauss)${}=0.0126H'$ (in amp/meter).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S2-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">There is one more horrible thing. Many people who use <em class="emph">our</em>
definition of $\FLPH$ have decided to call the units of $\FLPH$
and $\FLPB$ by <em class="emph">different names</em>!  Even though they have the same
dimensions, they call the unit of $\FLPB$ one <em class="emph">gauss</em>,
and the unit
of $\FLPH$ one <em class="emph">oersted</em> (after
Gauss and
Oersted, of

gauss and $\FLPH$ in oersteds. They are really the same unit—$10^{-4}$ of
the mks unit. We have summarized the confusion about magnetic units

<p class="p">Suppose we have a torus (a donut) of iron wrapped with a coil of copper
wire, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F7">36–7</a>(a). A current $I$ flows in the
wire. What is the magnetic field? The magnetic field will be mainly
inside the iron; there, the lines of $\FLPB$ will be circles, as drawn
in Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F7">36–7</a>(b). Since the flux of $\FLPB$ is continuous,
its divergence is zero, and Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3616">36.16</a>) is satisfied. Next,
we write Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3617">36.17</a>) in another form by integrating around
the closed loop $\Gamma$ drawn in Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F7">36–7</a>(b). From
Stokes’ theorem, we have that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:19}
\oint_\Gamma\FLPH\cdot d\FLPs=\frac{1}{\epsO c^2}
\int_S\FLPj_{\text{cond}}\cdot\FLPn\,da,
\end{equation}

where the integral of $\FLPj$ is to be carried out over any surface $S$
bounded by $\Gamma$. This surface is cut once by each turn of the
winding. Each turn contributes the current $I$ to the integral, and,
if there are $N$ turns in all, the integral is $NI$. From the symmetry
of our problem, $\FLPB$ is the same all around the curve $\Gamma$; if
we assume that the magnetization, and therefore, the field $H$ is also
constant along $\Gamma$, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3619">36.19</a>) becomes
\begin{equation*}
Hl=\frac{NI}{\epsO c^2},

where $l$ is the length of the curve $\Gamma$. So,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:20}
H=\frac{1}{\epsO c^2}\,\frac{NI}{l}.

<div id="Ch36-S3-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Now all we need is an equation which relates $\FLPH$ to $\FLPB$. But
there isn’t any such equation! There is, of course,
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3618">36.18</a>), but it is no help because there is no direct
relation between $\FLPM$ and $\FLPB$ for a ferromagnetic material like
iron. The magnetization $\FLPM$ depends on the whole past history of the
iron, and not only on what $\FLPB$ is at the moment.</p>

<p class="p">All is not lost, though. We can get solutions in certain simple cases.
If we start out with unmagnetized iron—let’s say with iron that has
been annealed at high temperatures—then in the simple geometry of the
torus, all the iron will have the same magnetic history. Then we can say
something about $\FLPM$—and therefore about the relation between
$\FLPB$ and $\FLPH$—from experimental measurements. The field $\FLPH$
in the torus is, from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3620">36.20</a>), given as a constant times
the current $I$ in the winding. The field $\FLPB$ can be measured by
integrating over time the emf in the coil (or in an extra coil wound
over the magnetizing coil shown in the figure). This emf is equal to the
rate of change of the flux of $\FLPB$, so the integral of the emf with
time is equal to $\FLPB$ times the cross-sectional area of the torus.</p>

<p class="p">Figure <a href="#Ch36-F8">36–8</a> shows the relation between $\FLPB$ and $\FLPH$,
observed
with a torus of soft iron. When the current is first turned on,
$\FLPB$ increases with increasing $\FLPH$ along the curve $a$. Note
the different scales on $\FLPB$ and $\FLPH$; initially, it takes only
a relatively small $\FLPH$ to make a large $\FLPB$. Why is $\FLPB$ so
much larger with the iron than it would be with air? Because there is
a large magnetization $\FLPM$ which is equivalent to a large surface
current on the iron—the field $\FLPB$ comes from the <em class="emph">sum</em> of
this current and the conduction current in the winding. Why $\FLPM$
should be so large, we will discuss later.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">At higher values of $\FLPH$, the magnetization curve levels off. We
say that the iron <em class="emph">saturates</em>. With the scales of our figure, the
curve appears to become horizontal. Actually, it continues to rise
slightly—for large fields, $\FLPB$ becomes proportional to $\FLPH$,
and with a unit slope. There is no further increase of $\FLPM$.
Incidentally, we should point out that if the torus were made
of some nonmagnetic material, $\FLPM$ would be zero and $\FLPB$ would
equal $\FLPH$ for all fields.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S3-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">The first thing we notice is that curve $a$ in Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F8">36–8</a>—which is
the so-called <em class="emph">magnetization curve</em>—is highly nonlinear. But
it’s worse than that. If, after reaching saturation, we decrease the
current in the coil to bring $\FLPH$ back to zero, the magnetic
field $\FLPB$ falls along curve $b$. When $\FLPH$ reaches zero, there is
still some $\FLPB$ left. Even with no magnetizing current there is a
magnetic field in the iron—it has become permanently magnetized. If
we now turn on a <em class="emph">negative</em> current in the coil, the
$B$-$H$ curve continues along $b$ until the iron is saturated in the negative
direction.  If we then bring the current back to zero again, $\FLPB$
goes along curve $c$. If we alternate the current between large
positive and negative values, the $B$-$H$ curve goes back and forth
along very nearly the curves $b$ and $c$. If we vary $\FLPH$ in some
arbitrary way, however, we can get more complicated curves which will,
in general, lie somewhere between the curves $b$ and $c$. The loop
made by repeated oscillation of the fields is called a
<em class="emph">hysteresis</em> loop of the iron.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S3-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">We see then that we cannot write a functional relationship
like $B=f(H)$, because the value of $\FLPB$ at any instant depends not
only on what $\FLPH$ is at that time, but on its whole past history.
Naturally, the magnetization and hysteresis curves are different for
different substances. The shape of the curves depends critically on the
chemical composition of the material, and also on the details of its
preparation and subsequent physical treatment. We will discuss some of
the physical explanations for these complications in the next chapter.</p>

<h3 class="title section-title">
<span class="tag">36–4</span>Iron-core inductances</h3>
<div id="Ch36-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">One of the most important applications of magnetic materials is in
electrical circuits—for example, in transformers, electric motors, and
so on. One reason is that with iron we can control where the magnetic
fields go, and also get much larger fields for a given electric current.
For example, the typical “toroidal” inductance is made very much like
the object shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F7">36–7</a>. For a given inductance, it
can be much smaller in volume and use much less copper than an
equivalent “air-core” inductance. For a given inductance, we get a
much smaller resistance in the winding, so the inductance is more nearly
“ideal”—particularly for low frequencies. It is very easy to
understand, qualitatively, how such an inductance works. If $I$ is the
current in the winding, then the field $\FLPH$ which is produced in the
inside is proportional to $I$—as given by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3620">36.20</a>). The
voltage $\voltage$ across the terminals is related to the magnetic
field $\FLPB$. Neglecting the resistance of the winding, the
voltage $\voltage$ is proportional to $\ddpl{\FLPB}{t}$. The
inductance $\selfInd$, which is the ratio of $\voltage$ to $dI/dt$ (see
Section <a href="II_17.html#Ch17-S7">17–7</a>), thus involves the relation between $B$
and $H$ in the iron. Since the $\FLPB$ is so much bigger than the $\FLPH$,
we get a large factor in the inductance. Physically, what happens is
that a small current in the coil, which would ordinarily produce a small
magnetic field, causes the little “slave” magnets in the iron to line
up and produce a tremendously greater “magnetic” current than the
external current in the winding. It is as if we had a lot more current
going through the coil than we really have. When we reverse the current,
all the little magnets flip over—all those internal currents
reverse—and we get a much higher induced emf than we would get without
the iron. If we want to calculate the inductance, we can do so through
the energy—as described in Section <a href="II_17.html#Ch17-S8">17–8</a>. The <em class="emph">rate</em>
at which energy is delivered from the current source is $I\voltage$. The
voltage $\voltage$ is the cross-sectional area $A$ of the core,
times $N$, times $dB/dt$. From Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3620">36.20</a>), $I=(\epsO c^2l/N)H$.
So we have
\begin{equation*}
\ddt{U}{t}=\voltage I=(\epsO c^2lA)H\,\ddt{B}{t}.
\end{equation*}

Integrating over time, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:21}
U=(\epsO c^2lA)\int H\,dB.
\end{equation}

Notice that $lA$ is the volume of the torus, so we have shown that the
energy density $u=U/\text{vol}$ in a magnetic material is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:22}
u=\epsO c^2\int H\,dB.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">An interesting feature is involved here. When we use alternating
currents, the iron is driven around a hysteresis loop. Since $B$ is
not a single-valued function of $H$, the integral of $\int H\,dB$
around one complete cycle is <em class="emph">not</em> equal to zero. It is the area
enclosed inside the hysteresis curve. Thus, the driving source
delivers a certain net energy each cycle—an energy proportional to
the area inside the hysteresis loop. And that energy is “lost.” It
is lost from the electromagnetic goings on, but turns up as heat in
the iron. It is called the <em class="emph">hysteresis loss</em>. To keep such energy
losses small, we would like the hysteresis loop to be as narrow as
possible. One way to decrease the area of the loop is to reduce the
maximum field that is reached during each cycle. For smaller maximum
fields, we get a hysteresis curve like the one shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F9">36–9</a>. Also, special materials are designed to have a
very narrow loop. The so-called <em class="emph">transformer irons</em>—which are
iron alloys with a small amount of silicon—have been developed to have
this property.</p>

<div id="Ch36-S4-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">When an inductance is run over a small hysteresis loop, the
relationship between $B$ and $H$ can be approximated by a linear
equation. People usually write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:23}
B=\mu H.
\end{equation}

The constant $\mu$ is <em class="emph">not</em> the magnetic moment we have used
before. It is called the <em class="emph">permeability</em> of the
iron. (It is also sometimes called the “<em class="emph">relative
permeability</em>.”) The permeability of ordinary irons is typically several
thousand. There are special alloys alike
“supermalloy” which can have permeabilities as high
as a million.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S4-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">If we use the approximation that $B=\mu H$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3621">36.21</a>),
we can write the energy in a toroidal inductance as
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:24}
U=(\epsO c^2lA)\mu\int H\,dH=(\epsO c^2lA)\,\frac{\mu H^2}{2}.

<span class="eq-narrow">

\label{Eq:II:36:24}

\end{align}
</span>
So the energy density is approximately
\begin{equation*}
u\approx\frac{\epsO c^2}{2}\,\mu H^2.
\end{equation*}

We can now set the energy of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3624">36.24</a>) equal to the
energy $\selfInd I^2/2$ of an inductance, and solve for $\selfInd$. We get
\begin{equation*}
\selfInd=(\epsO c^2lA)\mu\biggl(\frac{H}{I}\biggr)^2.
\end{equation*}

Using $H/I$ from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3620">36.20</a>), we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:25}
\selfInd=\frac{\mu N^2A}{\epsO c^2l}.
\end{equation}

The inductance is proportional to $\mu$. If you want inductances for
such things as audio amplifiers, you will try to operate them on a
hysteresis loop where the $B$-$H$ relationship is as linear as possible.
(You will remember that we spoke in Chapter <a href="I_50.html">50</a>, Vol. I,
about the generation of harmonics in nonlinear systems.) For such
purposes, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3623">36.23</a>) is a useful approximation. On the
other hand, if you <em class="emph">want</em> to generate harmonics, you may use an
inductance which is intentionally operated in a highly nonlinear way.
Then you will have to use the complete $B$-$H$ curves, and analyze what
happens by graphical or numerical methods.</p>

<div id="Ch36-S4-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">A “transformer” is often made by putting two coils on the same
torus—or <em class="emph">core</em>—of a magnetic material. (For the larger
transformers, the core is made with rectangular proportions for
convenience.) Then a varying current in the “primary” winding causes
the magnetic field in the core to change, which induces an emf in the
“secondary” winding. Since the flux through <em class="emph">each turn</em> of both
windings is the same, the emf’s in the two windings are in the same
ratio as the number of turns on each. A voltage applied to the primary
is transformed to a different voltage at the secondary. Since a
certain <em class="emph">net</em> current around the core is needed to produce the
required change in the magnetic field, the <em class="emph">algebraic</em> sum of the
currents in the two windings will be fixed and equal to the required
“magnetizing” current. If the current drawn from the secondary
increases, the primary current must increase in proportion—there is
a “transformation” of currents as well as voltage.</p>

spread out somewhat in the gap, but if the gap is narrow, this will be
a small effect. It is a fair approximation to assume that the flux
of $\FLPB$ through any cross section of the yoke is a constant. If the
yoke has a uniform cross-sectional area $A$—and if we neglect any edge
effects at the gaps or at the corners—we can say that $\FLPB$ is
uniform around the yoke.</p>

Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3616">36.16</a>). Imagine the closed surface $S$, shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F11">36–11</a>(b), which has one face in the gap and the other
in the iron. The total flux of $\FLPB$ out of this surface must be zero.
Calling $B_1$ the field in the gap and $B_2$ the field in the iron, we

B_1A-B_2A=0.

the line integral around the curve $\Gamma$ in

will be different in the iron and in the air. Calling $H_2$ the field in
the iron and $l_2$ the path length around the yoke, this part of the
curve will contribute the amount $H_2l_2$ to the integral. Calling $H_1$
the field in the gap and $l_1$ the gap thickness, we get the
contribution $H_1l_1$ from the gap. We have that

becomes
\begin{equation}

<div id="Ch36-S6-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We now turn to the question of why it is that in ferromagnetic
materials a small magnetic field produces such a large
magnetization. The magnetization of ferromagnetic materials like iron
and nickel comes from the magnetic moment of the electrons in the
inner shell of the atom. Each electron has a magnetic moment $\FLPmu$
equal to $q/2m$ times its $g$-factor, times its angular
momentum $\FLPJ$. For a single electron with no net orbital motion, $g=2$, and
the component of $\FLPJ$ in any direction—say the
$z$-direction—is $\pm\hbar/2$,
so the component of $\FLPmu$ along the $z$-axis is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:28}
\mu_z=\frac{q\hbar}{2m}=0.928\times10^{-23}\text{ amp$\cdot$m$^2$}.
\end{equation}

In an iron atom, there are actually two electrons that contribute to
the ferromagnetism, so to keep the discussion simpler we will talk
about nickel, which is ferromagnetic like iron but which has only one
electron in the inner shell. (It is easy to extend the arguments to
iron.)
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Now the point is that in the presence of an external field $\FLPB$,
the atomic magnets tend to line up with the field, but are knocked
about by thermal motions just as we described for paramagnetic
materials. In the last chapter we found out that the balance between a
magnetic field trying to line up the atomic magnets and the thermal
motions trying to derange them produced the result that the mean
magnetic moment per unit volume will end up as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:29}
M=N\mu\tanh\frac{\mu B_a}{kT}.
\end{equation}

By $\FLPB_a$ we mean the field acting at the atom, and $kT$ is the
Boltzmann energy. In the theory
of paramagnetism we used for $B_a$ just $B$ itself, neglecting the part
of the field at any given atom contributed by the atoms nearby. In the
ferromagnetic case, there is a complication. We shouldn’t use the
average field in the iron for the $\FLPB_a$ acting on an individual
atom. Instead, we must do as we did in the case of dielectrics—we have
to find the <em class="emph">local</em> field acting at a single atom. For an exact
calculation we should add up the fields at the atom in question
contributed by all of the other atoms in the crystal lattice. But as we
did for dielectrics, we will make the approximation that the field at an
atom is the same as we would find in a small spherical hole in the
material—assuming that the moments of the atoms in the neighborhood
are not changed by the presence of the hole.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Following the arguments we made in Chapter <a href="II_11.html">11</a>, we might
think that we could write
\begin{equation*}
\FLPB_{\text{hole}}=\FLPB+\frac{1}{3}\,\frac{\FLPM}{\epsO c^2}\quad
(\text{wrong!}).
\end{equation*}

But that is not right. We <em class="emph">can</em>, however, make use of the results
of Chapter <a href="II_11.html">11</a> if we make a careful comparison of the
equations of Chapter <a href="II_11.html">11</a> with the equations for
ferromagnetism in this chapter. Let’s put together the corresponding
equations. For regions where there are no conduction currents or
charges we have:
<span class="eq-wide">
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:30}
\begin{alignedat}{2}
&\text{Electrostatics}&\qquad
&\text{Static ferromagnetism}\\
&\FLPdiv{\biggl(\FLPE+\frac{\FLPP}{\epsO}\biggr)}=0&\qquad
&\FLPdiv{\FLPB}=0\\
&\FLPcurl{\FLPE}=\FLPzero&\qquad
&\FLPcurl{\biggl(\FLPB-\frac{\FLPM}{\epsO c^2}\biggr)}=\FLPzero

&\FLPcurl{\biggl(\FLPB-\frac{\FLPM}{\epsO c^2}\biggr)}=\FLPzero
\end{aligned}
\label{Eq:II:36:30}
\end{equation}

</span>
These two sets of equations can be thought of as analogous if we make
the following <em class="emph">purely mathematical</em> correspondences:
\begin{equation*}
\FLPE\to\FLPB-\frac{\FLPM}{\epsO c^2},\quad
\FLPE+\frac{\FLPP}{\epsO}\to\FLPB.
\end{equation*}

This is the same as making the analogy
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:31}
\FLPE\to\FLPH,\quad\FLPP\to\FLPM/c^2.
\end{equation}

In other words, if we write the equations of ferromagnetism as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:32}
\begin{aligned}
&\FLPdiv{\biggl(\FLPH+\frac{\FLPM}{\epsO c^2}\biggr)}=0,\\[1ex]
&\FLPcurl{\FLPH}=\FLPzero,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

they <em class="emph">look like</em> the equations of electrostatics.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">This purely algebraic correspondence has led to some confusion in the
past. People tended to think that $\FLPH$ was “<em class="emph">the</em> magnetic
field.” But, as we have seen, $\FLPB$ and $\FLPE$ are physically the
fundamental fields, and $\FLPH$ is a derived idea. So although the
<em class="emph">equations</em> are analogous, the <em class="emph">physics</em> is not
analogous. However, that doesn’t need to stop us from using the
principle that the same equations have the same solutions.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">We can use our earlier results for the electric field inside of holes of
various shapes in dielectrics—summarized in
Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F1">36–1</a>—to find the field $\FLPH$ inside of
corresponding holes. Knowing $\FLPH$, we can determine $\FLPB$. For
instance (using the results we summarized in
Section <a href="#Ch36-S1">36–1</a>), the field $\FLPH$ in a needle-shaped hole
parallel to $\FLPM$ is the same as the $\FLPH$ in the material,
\begin{equation*}
\FLPH_{\text{hole}}=\FLPH_{\text{material}}.
\end{equation*}

But since $\FLPM$ in the hole is zero, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:33}
\FLPB_{\text{hole}}=\FLPB_{\text{material}}-\frac{\FLPM}{\epsO c^2}.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">On the other hand, for a disc-shaped hole, perpendicular to $\FLPM$,
we have
\begin{equation}
\FLPE_{\text{hole}}=\FLPE_{\text{dielectric}}+\frac{\FLPP}{\epsO},\notag
\end{equation}

which translates into
\begin{equation}
\FLPH_{\text{hole}}=\FLPH_{\text{material}}+\frac{\FLPM}{\epsO c^2}.\notag
\end{equation}

Or, in terms of $\FLPB$,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:34}
\FLPB_{\text{hole}}=\FLPB_{\text{material}}.
\end{equation}

Finally, for a spherical hole, by making our analogy with
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII363">36.3</a>) we would have
\begin{equation}
\FLPH_{\text{hole}}=\FLPH_{\text{material}}+\frac{\FLPM}{3\epsO c^2}\notag
\end{equation}

or
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:35}
\FLPB_{\text{hole}}=\FLPB_{\text{material}}-\frac{2}{3}\,
\frac{\FLPM}{\epsO c^2}.
\end{equation}

This result is quite different from what we got for $\FLPE$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">It is, of course, possible to get these results in a more physical way,
by using the Maxwell equations directly. For example,
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3634">36.34</a>) follows directly from $\FLPdiv{\FLPB}=0$. (You
use a gaussian surface that is half in the material and half out.)
Similarly, you can get Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3633">36.33</a>) by using a line integral
along a curve that goes up inside the hole and returns through the
material. Physically, the field in the hole is reduced because of the
surface currents—which are given by $\FLPcurl{\FLPM}$. We will leave
it for you to show that Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3635">36.35</a>) can also be obtained by
considering the effects of the surface currents on the boundary of the
spherical cavity.

<div id="Ch36-S6-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">In finding the equilibrium magnetization from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3629">36.29</a>),
it turns out to be most convenient to deal with $\FLPH$; so write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:36}
\FLPB_a=\FLPH+\lambda\,\frac{\FLPM}{\epsO c^2}.
\end{equation}

In the spherical hole approximation, we would have
$\lambda=\tfrac{1}{3}$, but, as you will see, we will want later to
use some other value, so we leave it as an adjustable parameter. Also,
we will take all the fields in the same direction so that we won’t
need to worry about the vector directions. If we were now to
substitute Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3636">36.36</a>) into Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3629">36.29</a>),
we would have one equation that relates the magnetization $M$ to the
magnetizing field $H$:
\begin{equation*}
M=N\mu\tanh\biggl(\mu\,\frac{H+\lambda M/\epsO c^2}{kT}\biggr).
\end{equation*}

It is however, an equation that cannot be solved explicitly, so we
will do it graphically.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s put the problem in a generalized form by writing
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3629">36.29</a>) as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:37}
\frac{M}{M_{\text{sat}}}=\tanh x,
\end{equation}

where $M_{\text{sat}}$ is the saturation value of the magnetization,
namely, $N\mu$, and $x$ represents $\mu B_a/kT$. The dependence
of $M/M_{\text{sat}}$ on $x$ is shown by curve $a$ in
Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F13">36–13</a>. We can also write $x$ as a function
of $M$—using Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3636">36.36</a>) for $B_a$—as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:38}
x=\frac{\mu B_a}{kT}=\frac{\mu H}{kT}+\biggl(\frac{\mu\lambda M_{\text{sat}}}
{\epsO c^2kT}\biggr)\frac{M}{M_{\text{sat}}}.
\end{equation}

For any given value of $H$, this is a straight-line relationship
between $M/M_{\text{sat}}$ and $x$. The $x$ intercept is at $x=\mu
H/kT$, and the slope is $\epsO c^2kT/\mu\lambda M_{\text{sat}}$. For
any particular $H$, we would have a line like the one marked $b$ in
Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F13">36–13</a>. The intersection of curves $a$ and $b$ gives us the
solution for $M/M_{\text{sat}}$. We have solved the problem.</p>

Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3638">36.38</a>) that the slope of the line is proportional to
the absolute temperature $T$. So, at <em class="emph">high temperatures</em> we would
have a line like $b_1$. The solution is $M/M_{\text{sat}}=0$. When the
magnetizing field $H$ is zero, the magnetization is also zero. But at
<em class="emph">low temperatures</em>, we would have a line like $b_2$, and there are
<em class="emph">two solutions</em> for $M/M_{\text{sat}}$—one with
$M/M_{\text{sat}}=0$ and one with $M/M_{\text{sat}}$ near one. It turns
out that only the upper solution is stable—as you can see by
considering small variations about these solutions.</p>

<div id="Ch36-S6-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">According to these ideas, then, a magnetic material should magnetize
itself <em class="emph">spontaneously</em> at sufficiently low temperatures. In
short, when the thermal motions are small enough, the coupling between
the atomic magnets causes them all to line up parallel to each
other—we have a permanently magnetized material analogous to the
ferroelectrics we discussed in Chapter <a href="II_11.html">11</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">If we start at high temperatures and come down, there is a critical
temperature, called the Curie temperature $T_c$, where the ferromagnetic
behavior suddenly sets in. This temperature corresponds to the
line $b_3$ of Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F14">36–14</a>, which is tangent to the
curve $a$, and has, therefore, a slope of $1$. The Curie temperature is
given by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:39}
\frac{\epsO c^2kT_c}{\mu\lambda M_{\text{sat}}}=1.
\end{equation}

We can, if we wish, write Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3638">36.38</a>) more simply in
terms of $T_c$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:40}
x=\frac{\mu H}{kT}+\frac{T_c}{T}\biggl(\frac{M}{M_{\text{sat}}}\biggr).
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p13" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we want to see what happens for small magnetizing fields $H$. We
can see from Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F14">36–14</a> how things will go if we shift our straight
lines a little to the right. For the low-temperature case, the
intersection point will move out a little bit along the low-slope part
of curve $a$, and $M$ will change relatively little. For the
high-temperature case, however, the intersection point runs up the
steep part of curve $a$, and $M$ will change relatively rapidly. In
fact, we can approximate this part of curve $a$ by a straight line of
unit slope, and write:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{M}{M_{\text{sat}}}=x=\frac{\mu H}{kT}+
\frac{T_c}{T}\biggl(\frac{M}{M_{\text{sat}}}\biggr).
\end{equation*}

Now we can solve for $M/M_{\text{sat}}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:41}
\frac{M}{M_{\text{sat}}}=\frac{\mu H}{k(T-T_c)}.
\end{equation}

We have a law that is something like the one we had for
paramagnetism. For paramagnetism, we had
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:36:42}
\frac{M}{M_{\text{sat}}}=\frac{\mu B}{kT}.
\end{equation}

One difference now is that we have the magnetization in terms of $H$,
which includes some of the effects of the interaction of the atomic
magnets, but the main difference is that the magnetization is inversely
proportional to the <em class="emph">difference</em> between $T$ and $T_c$, instead of
to the absolute temperate $T$, alone. Neglecting the interactions
between neighboring atoms corresponds to taking $\lambda=0$, which from
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3639">36.39</a>) means taking $T_c=0$. Then the results are just
what we had in Chapter <a href="II_35.html">35</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p14" class="para">
<p class="p">We can check our theoretical picture with the experimental data for
nickel. It is observed experimentally that the ferromagnetic behavior of
nickel disappears when its temperature is raised above $631^\circ$K. We
can compare this with $T_c$ calculated from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3639">36.39</a>).
Remembering that $M_{\text{sat}}=\mu N$, we have
\begin{equation*}
T_c=\lambda\,\frac{N\mu^2}{k\epsO c^2}.
\end{equation*}

From the density and atomic weight of nickel, we get
\begin{equation*}
N=9.1\times10^{28}\:\text{m}^{-3}.
\end{equation*}

Taking $\mu$ from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3628">36.28</a>), and setting
$\lambda=\tfrac{1}{3}$, we get
\begin{equation*}
T_c=0.24^\circ\text{K}.
\end{equation*}

There is a discrepancy of a factor of about $2600$! Our theory of
ferromagnetism fails completely.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p15" class="para">
<p class="p">We can try to “patch up” the theory as Weiss did by saying that for
some unknown reason $\lambda$ is not one-third,
but $(2600)\times\tfrac{1}{3}$—or about $900$. It turns out that one
gets similar values for other ferromagnetic materials like iron. To
see what this means, let’s go back to Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII3636">36.36</a>). We
see that a large $\lambda$ means that $B_a$, the local field on the
atom, appears to be much, much larger than we would think. In fact,
writing $H=B-M/\epsO c^2$, we have
\begin{equation*}
B_a=B+\frac{(\lambda-1)M}{\epsO c^2}.
\end{equation*}

According to our original idea—with $\lambda=\tfrac{1}{3}$ the local
magnetization $M$ <em class="emph">reduces</em> the effective field $B_a$ by the
amount $-\tfrac{2}{3}M/\epsO c^2$. Even if our model of a spherical
hole were not very good, we would still expect <em class="emph">some</em>
reduction. Instead, to explain the phenomenon of ferromagnetism, we
have to imagine that the magnetization of the field <em class="emph">enhances</em>
the local field by some large factor—like one thousand or
more. There doesn’t seem to be any reasonable way to manufacture such
tremendous fields at an atom—nor even fields of the proper sign!
Clearly, our “magnetic” theory of ferromagnetism is a dismal
failure. We must conclude, then, that ferromagnetism has to do with
some <em class="emph">nonmagnetic</em> interaction between the spinning electrons in
neighboring atoms. This interaction must generate a strong tendency
for all of the nearby spins to line up in one direction. We will see
later that it has to do with quantum mechanics and the Pauli exclusion
principle.
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p16" class="para">
<p class="p">Finally, we look at what happens at low temperatures—for $T&lt;T_c$. We
have seen that there will then be a spontaneous magnetization—even
with $H=0$—given by the intersection of the curves $a$ and $b_2$ of
Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F14">36–14</a>. If we solve for $M$ for various
temperatures—by varying the slope of the line $b_2$—we get the
theoretical curve shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch36-F15">36–15</a>. This curve should be
the same for all ferromagnetic materials for which the atomic moment
comes from a single electron. The curves for other materials are only
slightly different.</p>

They fit the theoretical curve fairly well. Even though we don’t
understand the basic mechanism, the general features of the theory seem
to be correct.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch36-S6-p18" class="para">
<p class="p">Finally, there is one more disturbing discrepancy in our attempt to
understand ferromagnetism. We have found that above some temperature
the material should behave like a paramagnetic substance with a
magnetization $M$ proportional to $H$ (or $B$), and that below that
temperature it should become spontaneously magnetized. But that’s not
what we found when we measured the magnetization curve for iron. It
only became permanently magnetized <em class="emph">after</em> we had “magnetized”
it. According to the ideas just discussed, it would magnetize itself!
What is wrong? Well, it turns out that if you look at a <em class="emph">small
enough crystal</em> of iron or nickel, it is indeed completely magnetized!
But in large pieces of iron, there are many small regions or
“domains” that are magnetized in different directions, so that on a
large scale the <em class="emph">average</em> magnetization appears to be zero. In
each small domain, however, the iron has a locked-in magnetization
with $M$ nearly equal to $M_{\text{sat}}$. The consequences of this
domain structure are that gross properties of large pieces of material
are quite different from the microscopic properties that we have
really been treating. We will take up in the next lecture the story of
the practical behavior of bulk magnetic materials.</p>
