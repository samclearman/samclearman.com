<p class="p">Here we begin to discuss another of the peculiar properties
of matter under the influence of the electric field. In an earlier
chapter we considered the behavior of <em class="emph">conductors</em>, in which the
charges move freely in response to an electric field to such points that
there is no field left inside a conductor. Now we will discuss
<em class="emph">insulators</em>, materials which do not conduct
electricity. One might at first believe that there should be no effect
whatsoever. However, using a simple electroscope and a parallel-plate
capacitor, Faraday discovered
that this was not so. His experiments showed that the capacitance of
such a capacitor is <em class="emph">increased</em> when an insulator is put between
the plates. If the insulator completely fills the space between the
plates, the capacitance is increased by a factor $\kappa$ which depends
only on the nature of the insulating material. Insulating materials are
also called <em class="emph">dielectrics</em>; the factor $\kappa$ is then a property
of the dielectric, and is called the <em class="emph">dielectric constant</em>. The
dielectric constant of a vacuum is, of course, unity.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">Our problem now is to explain why there is any electrical effect if
the insulators are indeed insulators and do not conduct
electricity. We begin with the experimental fact that the capacitance
is increased and try to reason out what might be going on. Consider a
parallel-plate capacitor with some charges on the surfaces of the
conductors, let us say negative charge on the top plate and positive
charge on the bottom plate. Suppose that the spacing between the
plates is $d$ and the area of each plate is $A$. As we have proved
earlier, the capacitance is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:10:1}
C=\frac{\epsO A}{d},
\end{equation}

and the charge and voltage on the capacitor are related by
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:10:2}
Q=CV.
\end{equation}

Now the experimental fact is that if we put a piece of insulating
material like lucite or glass between the plates, we find that the
capacitance is larger. That means, of course, that the voltage is
lower for the same charge. But the voltage difference is the integral
of the electric field across the capacitor; so we must conclude that
inside the capacitor, the electric field is reduced even though the
charges on the plates remain unchanged.

<p class="p">Now how can that be? We have a law due to Gauss that tells us that the
flux of the electric field is directly related to the enclosed
charge. Consider the gaussian surface $S$ shown by broken lines in
Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F1">10–1</a>. Since the electric field is reduced with the
dielectric present, we conclude that the net charge inside the surface
must be lower than it would be without the material. There is only one
possible conclusion, and that is that there must be positive charges
on the surface of the dielectric.  Since the field is reduced but is
not zero, we would expect this positive charge to be smaller than the
negative charge on the conductor. So the phenomena can be explained if
we could understand in some way that when a dielectric material is
placed in an electric field there is positive charge induced on one
surface and negative charge induced on the other.</p>

that we had a capacitor with a plate spacing $d$, and we put between
the plates a neutral conductor whose thickness is $b$, as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F2">10–2</a>. The electric field induces a positive charge on
the upper surface and a negative charge on the lower surface, so there
is no field inside the conductor. The field in the rest of the space is
the same as it was without the conductor, because it is the surface
density of charge divided by $\epsO$; but the distance over which we
have to integrate to get the voltage (the potential difference) is
reduced. The voltage is
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{\sigma}{\epsO}\,(d-b).

The resulting equation for the capacitance is like

that all insulating materials contain small conducting spheres

explained by the effect of the charges which would be induced on each

observed. More specifically, it
was assumed that each of the atoms of a material was a perfect
conductor, but insulated from the others. The dielectric

the conducting spheres. This is not, however, the model that is used

workings of dielectric materials.  However, we give here one example
to illustrate a possible mechanism. An atom has a positive charge on
the nucleus, which is surrounded by negative electrons.  In an
electric field, the nucleus will be attracted in one direction and the
electrons in the other. The orbits or wave patterns of the electrons
(or whatever picture is used in quantum mechanics) will be distorted
to some extent, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F4">10–4</a>; the center of
gravity of the negative charge will be displaced and will no longer
coincide with the positive charge of the nucleus. We have already
discussed such distributions of charge. If we look from a distance,
such a neutral configuration is equivalent, to a first approximation,
to a little dipole.</p>

average any charge density produced by this?  Not if $\FLPP$ is
uniform. If the positive and negative charges being displaced relative
to each other have the same average density, the fact that they are
displaced does not produce any net charge inside the volume. On the
other hand, if $\FLPP$ were larger at one place and smaller at
another, that would mean that more charge would be moved into some
region than away from it; we would then expect to get a volume density
of charge. For the parallel-plate condenser, we suppose that $\FLPP$
is uniform, so we need to look only at what happens at the
surfaces. At one surface the negative charges, the electrons, have
effectively moved out a distance $\delta$; at the other surface they
have moved in, leaving some positive charge effectively out a

induced on the surface, we divide by $A$. The magnitude of the surface
charge density is
\begin{equation*}

<p class="p">Today we look upon these matters from another point of view, namely,
that we have simpler equations in a vacuum, and if we exhibit in every
case all the charges, whatever their origin, the equations are always
correct. If we separate some of the charges away for convenience, or
because we do not want to discuss what is going on in detail, then we
can, if we wish, write our equations in any other form that may be
convenient.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S4-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">One more point should be emphasized. An equation like $\FLPD=\epsilon\FLPE$
is an attempt to describe a property of
matter. But matter is extremely complicated, and such an equation is
in fact not correct. For instance, if $\FLPE$ gets too large,
then $\FLPD$ is no longer proportional to $\FLPE$. For some substances, the
proportionality breaks down even with relatively small fields. Also,
the “constant” of proportionality may depend on how fast $\FLPE$
changes with time. Therefore this kind of equation is a kind of
approximation, like Hooke’s law.
It cannot be a deep and fundamental
equation.  On the other hand, our fundamental equations for $\FLPE$,
(<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1017">10.17</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1019">10.19</a>), represent our deepest and
most complete understanding of electrostatics.

<div id="Ch10-S5-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We will now prove some rather general theorems for electrostatics in
situations where dielectrics are present. We have seen that the
capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is increased by a definite
factor if it is filled with a dielectric. We can show that this is
true for a capacitor of <em class="emph">any</em> shape, provided the entire region
in the neighborhood of the two conductors is filled with a uniform
linear dielectric.  Without the dielectric, the equations to be solved
are
\begin{equation*}
\FLPdiv{\FLPE_0}=\frac{\rho_{\text{free}}}{\epsO}\quad
\text{and}
\quad
\FLPcurl{\FLPE_0}=\FLPzero.
\end{equation*}

With the dielectric present, the first of these equations is modified;
we have instead the equations
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:10:26}
\FLPdiv{(\kappa\FLPE)}=\frac{\rho_{\text{free}}}{\epsO}\quad
\text{and}
\quad
\FLPcurl{\FLPE}=\FLPzero.
\end{equation}

Now since we are taking $\kappa$ to be everywhere the same, the last
two equations can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:10:27}
\FLPdiv{(\kappa\FLPE)}=\frac{\rho_{\text{free}}}{\epsO}\quad
\text{and}
\quad
\FLPcurl{(\kappa\FLPE)}=\FLPzero.
\end{equation}
</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S5-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We therefore have the same equations for $\kappa\FLPE$ as
for $\FLPE_0$, so they have the solution $\kappa\FLPE=\FLPE_0$. In other
words, the field is everywhere smaller, by the factor $1/\kappa$, than
in the case without the dielectric. Since the voltage difference is a
line integral of the field, the voltage is reduced by this same
factor. Since the charge on the electrodes of the capacitor has been
taken the same in both cases, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII102">10.2</a>) tells us that
the capacitance, in the case of an everywhere uniform dielectric, is
increased by the factor $\kappa$.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S5-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Let us now ask what the <em class="emph">force</em> would be between two charged
conductors in a dielectric. We consider a liquid dielectric that is
homogeneous everywhere. We have seen earlier that one way to obtain
the force is to differentiate the energy with respect to the
appropriate distance. If the conductors have equal and opposite
charges, the energy $U=Q^2/2C$, where $C$ is their capacitance. Using
the principle of virtual work, any component is given by a
differentiation; for example,
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:10:28}
F_x=-\ddp{U}{x}=-\frac{Q^2}{2}\,\ddp{}{x}\biggl(\frac{1}{C}\biggr).
\end{equation}

Since the dielectric increases the capacity by a factor $\kappa$, all
forces will be <em class="emph">reduced</em> by this same factor.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">One point should be emphasized. What we have said is true only if the
dielectric is a liquid. Any motion of conductors that are embedded in
a solid dielectric changes the mechanical stress conditions of the
dielectric and alters its electrical properties, as well as causing
some mechanical energy change in the dielectric. Moving the conductors
in a liquid does not change the liquid. The liquid moves to a new
place but its electrical characteristics are not changed.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S5-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Many older books on electricity start with the “fundamental” law
that the force between two charges is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:10:29}
F=\frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\epsO\kappa r^2},
\end{equation}

a point of view which is thoroughly unsatisfactory. For one thing, it
is not true in general; it is true only for a world filled with a
liquid. Secondly, it depends on the fact that $\kappa$ is a constant,
which is only approximately true for most real materials. It is much
better to start with Coulomb’s law for charges in a <em class="emph">vacuum</em>,
which is always right (for stationary charges).</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S5-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">What does happen in a solid? This is a very difficult problem which
has not been solved, because it is, in a sense, indeterminate. If you
put charges inside a dielectric solid, there are many kinds of
pressures and strains. You cannot deal with virtual work without
including also the mechanical energy required to compress the solid,
and it is a difficult matter, generally speaking, to make a unique
distinction between the electrical forces and the mechanical forces
due to the solid material itself. Fortunately, no one ever really
needs to know the answer to the question proposed. He may sometimes
want to know how much strain there is going to be in a solid, and that
can be worked out. But it is much more complicated than the simple
result we got for liquids.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S5-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">A surprisingly complicated problem in the theory of dielectrics is the
following: Why does a charged object pick up little pieces of
dielectric? If you comb your hair on a dry day, the comb readily picks
up small scraps of paper. If you thought casually about it, you
probably assumed the comb had one charge on it and the paper had the
opposite charge on it. But the paper is initially electrically
neutral.  It hasn’t any net charge, but it is attracted anyway. It is
true that sometimes the paper will come up to the comb and then fly
away, repelled immediately after it touches the comb. The reason is,
of course, that when the paper touches the comb, it picks up some
negative charges and then the like charges repel. But that doesn’t
answer the original question. Why did the paper come toward the comb
in the first place?</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S5-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">The answer has to do with the polarization of a dielectric when it is
placed in an electric field. There are polarization charges of both
signs, which are attracted and repelled by the comb. There is a net
attraction, however, because the field nearer the comb is stronger
than the field farther away—the comb is not an infinite sheet. Its
charge is localized. A neutral piece of paper will not be attracted to
either plate inside the parallel plates of a capacitor. The variation
of the field is an essential part of the attraction mechanism.</p>

<div id="Ch10-S5-p9" class="para">
<p class="p">As illustrated in Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F8">10–8</a>, a dielectric is always
drawn from a region of weak field toward a region of stronger
field. In fact, one can prove that for small objects the force is
proportional to the gradient of the <em class="emph">square</em> of the electric
field. Why does it depend on the square of the field? Because the
induced polarization charges are proportional to the fields, and for
given charges the forces are proportional to the field. However, as we
have just indicated, there will be a <em class="emph">net</em> force only if the
square of the field is changing from point to point. So the force is
proportional to the gradient of the square of the field. The constant
of proportionality involves, among other things, the dielectric
constant of the object, and it also depends upon the size and shape of
the object.</p>

can be computed by applying the principle of energy conservation.
</div>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S5-p10" class="para">
<p class="p">There is a related problem in which the force on a dielectric can be
worked out quite accurately. If we have a parallel-plate capacitor
with a dielectric slab only partially inserted, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch10-F9">10–9</a>, there will be a force driving the sheet in.  A
detailed examination of the force is quite complicated; it is related to
nonuniformities in the field near the edges of the dielectric and the
plates. However, if we do not look at the details, but merely use the
principle of conservation of energy, we can easily calculate the force.
We can find the force from the formula we derived earlier.
Equation (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1028">10.28</a>) is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:10:30}
F_x=-\ddp{U}{x}=+\frac{V^2}{2}\,\ddp{C}{x}.
\end{equation}

We need only find out how the capacitance varies with the position of
the dielectric slab.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S5-p11" class="para">
<p class="p">Let’s suppose that the total length of the plates is $L$, that the
width of the plates is $W$, that the plate separation and dielectric
thickness are $d$, and that the distance to which the dielectric has
been inserted is $x$. The capacitance is the ratio of the total free
charge on the plates to the voltage between the plates. We have seen
above that for a given voltage $V$ the surface charge density of free
charge is $\kappa\epsO V/d$.  So the total charge on the plates is
\begin{equation*}
Q=\frac{\kappa\epsO V}{d}\,xW+\frac{\epsO V}{d}\,(L-x)W,
\end{equation*}

from which we get the capacitance:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:10:31}
C=\frac{\epsO W}{d}\,(\kappa x+L-x).
\end{equation}

Using (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqII1030">10.30</a>), we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:II:10:32}
F_x=\frac{V^2}{2}\,\frac{\epsO W}{d}\,(\kappa-1).
\end{equation}

Now this equation is not particularly useful for anything unless you
happen to need to know the force in such circumstances. We only wished
to show that the theory of energy can often be used to avoid enormous
complications in determining the forces on dielectric materials—as
there would be in the present case.</p>
</div>
<div id="Ch10-S5-p12" class="para">
<p class="p">Our discussion of the theory of dielectrics has dealt only with
electrical phenomena, accepting the fact that the material has a
polarization which is proportional to the electric field. Why there is
such a proportionality is perhaps of greater interest to physics. Once
we understand the origin of the dielectric constants from an atomic
point of view, we can use electrical measurements of the dielectric
constants in varying circumstances to obtain detailed information
about atomic or molecular structure. This aspect will be treated in
part in the next chapter.</p>
