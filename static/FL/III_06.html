<div id="Ch6-S1-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">We also discussed a little bit about the fact that there can be more
than one base for the states and that we can use Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII61">6.1</a>)
to convert from one base to another. Suppose, for example, that we have
the amplitudes $\braket{iS}{\psi}$ to find the state $\psi$ in every one
of the base states $i$ of a base system $S$, but that we then decide
that we would prefer to describe the state in terms of another set of
base states, say the states $j$ belonging to the base $T$. In the
general formula, Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII61">6.1</a>), we could substitute $jT$
for $\chi$ and obtain this formula:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:4}
\braket{jT}{\psi}=\sum_i\braket{jT}{iS}\braket{iS}{\psi}.
\end{equation}
The amplitudes for the state $(\psi)$ to be in the base states $(jT)$
are related to the amplitudes to be in the base states $(iS)$ by the set
of coefficients $\braket{jT}{iS}$. If there are $N$ base states, there
are $N^2$ such coefficients. Such a set of coefficients is often called
the “<em class="emph">transformation matrix</em> to go from the
$S$-<em class="emph">representation</em> to the $T$-<em class="emph">representation</em>.” This looks
rather formidable mathematically, but with a little renaming we can see
that it is really not so bad. If we call $C_i$ the amplitude that the
state $\psi$ is in the base state $iS$—that is,
$C_i=\braket{iS}{\psi}$—and call $C_j'$ the corresponding amplitudes
for the base system $T$—that is, $C_j'=\braket{jT}{\psi}$, then
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII64">6.4</a>) can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:5}
C_j'=\sum_iR_{ji}C_i,
\end{equation}
where $R_{ji}$ means the same thing as $\braket{jT}{iS}$. Each
amplitude $C_j'$ is equal to a sum over all $i$ of one of the
coefficients $R_{ji}$ times each amplitude $C_i$. It has the same form
as the transformation of a vector from one coordinate system to another.

<p class="p">In order to avoid being too abstract for too long, we have given you
some examples of these coefficients for the spin-one case, so you can
see how to use them in practice. On the other hand, there is a very
beautiful thing in quantum mechanics—that from the sheer fact that
there are three states and from the symmetry properties of space under
rotations, these coefficients can be found purely by abstract reasoning.
Showing you such arguments at this early stage has a disadvantage in
that you are immersed in another set of abstractions before we get
“down to earth.” However, the thing is so beautiful that we are going
to do it anyway.

<p class="p">We will show you in this chapter how the transformation coefficients can
be derived for spin one-half particles. We pick this case, rather than
spin one, because it is somewhat easier. Our problem is to determine the
coefficients $R_{ji}$ for a particle—an atomic system—which is split
into two beams in a Stern-Gerlach apparatus. We are going to derive all
the coefficients for the transformation from one representation to
another by pure reasoning—plus a few assumptions. <em class="emph">Some</em>
assumptions are always necessary in order to use “pure” reasoning!
Although the arguments will be abstract and somewhat involved, the
result we get will be relatively simple to state and easy to
understand—and the result is the most important thing. You may, if you
wish, consider this as a sort of cultural excursion. We have, in fact,
arranged that all the essential results derived here are also derived in
some other way when they are needed in later chapters. So you need have
no fear of losing the thread of our study of quantum mechanics if you
omit this chapter entirely, or study it at some later time. The
excursion is “cultural” in the sense that it is intended to show that
the principles of quantum mechanics are not only interesting, but are so
deep that by adding only a few extra hypotheses about the structure of
space, we can deduce a great many properties of physical systems. Also,
it is important that we know where the different consequences of quantum
mechanics come from, because so long as our laws of physics are
incomplete—as we know they are—it is interesting to find out whether
the places where our theories fail to agree with experiment is where our
logic is the best or where our logic is the worst. Until now, it appears
that where our logic is the most abstract it always gives correct
results—it agrees with experiment. Only when we try to make specific
models of the internal machinery of the fundamental particles and their
interactions are we unable to find a theory that agrees with experiment.
The theory then that we are about to describe agrees with experiment
wherever it has been tested—for the strange particles as well as for
electrons, protons, and so on.

<div id="Ch6-S1-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">One remark on an annoying, but interesting, point before we proceed:
It is not possible to determine the coefficients $R_{ji}$ uniquely,
because there is always some arbitrariness in the probability
amplitudes. If you have a set of amplitudes of any kind, say the
amplitudes to arrive at some place by a whole lot of different routes,
and if you multiply every single amplitude by the same phase
factor—say by $e^{i\delta}$—you have another set that is just as
good. So, it is always possible to make an arbitrary change in phase
of all the amplitudes in any given problem if you want to.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch6-S1-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Suppose you calculate some probability by writing a sum of several
amplitudes, say $(A+B+C+\dotsb)$ and taking the absolute square. Then
somebody else calculates the same thing by using the sum of the
amplitudes $(A'+B'+C'+\dotsb)$ and taking the absolute square. If all
the $A'$, $B'$, $C'$, etc., are equal to the $A$, $B$, $C$, etc.,
except for a factor $e^{i\delta}$, all probabilities obtained by
taking the absolute squares will be exactly the same, since
$(A'+B'+C'+\dotsb)$ is then equal to $e^{i\delta}(A+B+C+\dotsb)$. Or
suppose, for instance, that we were computing something with
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII61">6.1</a>), but then we suddenly change all of the phases of
a certain base system. Every one of the amplitudes $\braket{i}{\psi}$
would be multiplied by the same factor $e^{i\delta}$. Similarly, the
amplitudes $\braket{i}{\chi}$ would also be changed by $e^{i\delta}$,
but the amplitudes $\braket{\chi}{i}$ are the complex conjugates of the
amplitudes $\braket{i}{\chi}$; therefore, the former gets changed by the
factor $e^{-i\delta}$. The plus and minus $i\delta$’s in the exponents
cancel out, and we would have the same expression we had before. So it
is a general rule that if we change all the amplitudes with respect to a
given base system by the same phase—or even if we just change
<em class="emph">all</em> the amplitudes in any problem by the same phase—it makes no
difference. There is, therefore, some freedom to choose the phases in
our transformation matrix. Every now and then we will make such an
arbitrary choice—usually following the conventions that are in general
use.

in the last chapter. A beam of spin one-half particles, entering at
the left, would, in general, be split into <em class="emph">two</em> beams, as shown
schematically in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F1">6-1</a>. (There were three beams for
spin <em class="emph">one</em>.) As before, the beams are put back together again
unless one or the other of them is blocked off by a “stop” which
intercepts the beam at its half-way point. In the figure we show an
arrow which points in the direction of the increase of the
<em class="emph">magnitude</em> of the field—say toward the magnet pole with the
sharp edges. This arrow we take to represent <em class="emph">the “up” axis</em> of
any particular apparatus. It is fixed relative to the apparatus and
will allow us to indicate the relative orientations when we use
several apparatuses together. We also assume that the direction of the
magnetic field in each magnet is always the same with respect to the
arrow.

<div id="Ch6-S2-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">Now suppose we put two of our modified Stern-Gerlach apparatuses in

which we call $S$, can be used to prepare a pure $(+S)$ or a pure
$(-S)$ state by blocking one beam or the other. [As shown it prepares
a pure $(+S)$ state.] For each condition, there is some amplitude for
a particle that comes out of $S$ to be in either the $(+T)$ or the
$(-T)$ beam of the second apparatus. There are, in fact, just four
amplitudes: the amplitude to go from $(+S)$ to $(+T)$, from $(+S)$
to $(-T)$, from $(-S)$ to $(+T)$, from $(-S)$ to $(-T)$. These amplitudes
are just the four coefficients of the transformation matrix $R_{ji}$
to go from the $S$-representation to the $T$-representation. We can
consider that the first apparatus “prepares” a particular state in
one representation and that the second apparatus “analyzes” that
state in terms of the second representation. The kind of question we
want to answer, then, is this: If an atom has been prepared in a given
condition—say the $(+S)$ state—by blocking one of the beams in the
apparatus $S$, what is the chance that it will get through the second
apparatus $T$ if this is set for, say, the $(-T)$ state. The result
will depend, of course, on the angles between the two systems $S$
and $T$.

<p class="p">We should explain why it is that we could have any hope of finding the

impossible to believe that if a particle has its spin lined up in the

with its spin pointing in the $+x$-direction—or in any other

quite. It is so nearly impossible that there is <em class="emph">only one way</em> it
can be done, and that is the reason we can find out what that unique
way is.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch6-S2-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">The first kind of argument we can make is this. Suppose we have a
setup like the one in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6-2</a>(a), in which we have
the two apparatuses $S$ and $T$, with $T$ cocked at the angle $\alpha$
with respect to $S$, and we let only the $(+)$ beam through $S$ and
the $(-)$ beam through $T$. We would observe a certain number for the
probability that the particles coming out of $S$ get through $T$. Now
suppose we make another measurement with the apparatus of
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6-2</a>(b). The <em class="emph">relative</em> orientation of $S$
and $T$ is the same, but the whole system sits at a different angle in
space. We want to <em class="emph">assume</em> that both of these experiments give the
same number for the chance that a particle in a pure state with respect
to $S$ will get into some particular state with respect to $T$. We are
assuming, in other words, that the result of any experiment of this type
is the same—that the <em class="emph">physics</em> is the same—no matter how the
<em class="emph">whole</em> apparatus is oriented in space. (You say, “That’s
obvious.” But it <em class="emph">is</em> an assumption, and it is “right” only if
it is actually what happens.)  That means that the coefficients $R_{ji}$
depend only on the relation in space of $S$ and $T$, and not on the
absolute situation of $S$ and $T$. To say this in another way, $R_{ji}$
depends only on the <em class="emph">rotation</em> which carries $S$ to $T$, for
evidently what is the same in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6-2</a>(a) and
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F2">6-2</a>(b) is the three-dimensional rotation which would
carry apparatus $S$ into the orientation of apparatus $T$. When the
transformation matrix $R_{ji}$ depends only on a rotation, as it does
here, it is called a <em class="emph">rotation matrix</em>.

<p class="p">For our next step we will need one more piece of information. Suppose
we add a third apparatus which we can call $U$, which follows $T$ at
some arbitrary angle, as in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F3">6-3</a>(a). (It’s
beginning to look horrible, but that’s the fun of abstract
thinking—you can make the most weird experiments just by drawing
lines!) Now what is the $S\to T\to U$ transformation? What we really
want to ask for is the amplitude to go from some state with respect
to $S$ to some other state with respect to $U$, when we know the
transformation from $S$ to $T$ and from $T$ to $U$. We are then asking
about an experiment in which both channels of $T$ are open. We can get
the answer by applying Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII65">6.5</a>) twice in
succession. For going from the $S$-representation to the
$T$-representation, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:6}
C_j'=\sum_iR_{ji}^{TS}C_i,
\end{equation}
where we put the superscripts $TS$ on the $R$, so that we can
distinguish it from the coefficients $R^{UT}$ we will have for going
from $T$ to $U$.

<div id="Ch6-S2-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Assuming the amplitudes to be in the base states of the
$U$-representation $C_k''$, we can relate them to the $T$-amplitudes

\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:7}
C_k''=\sum_jR_{kj}^{UT}C_j'.

Now we can combine Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII66">6.6</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII67">6.7</a>) to
get the transformation to $U$ directly from $S$. Substituting $C_j'$
from Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII66">6.6</a>) in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII67">6.7</a>), we have
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:8}
C_k''=\sum_jR_{kj}^{UT}\sum_iR_{ji}^{TS}C_i.
\end{equation}
Or, since $i$ does not appear in $R_{kj}^{UT}$, we can put the
$i$-summation also in front, and write
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:9}
C_k''=\sum_i\sum_jR_{kj}^{UT}R_{ji}^{TS}C_i.

This is the formula for a double transformation.

<div id="Ch6-S2-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">Notice, however, that so long as all the beams in $T$ are unblocked,
the state coming out of $T$ is the same as the one that went in. We
could just as well have made a transformation from the
$S$-representation directly to the $U$-representation. It should be
the same as putting the $U$ apparatus right after $S$, as in
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F3">6-3</a>(b). In that case, we would have written
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:10}
C_k''=\sum_iR_{ki}^{US}C_i,

with the coefficients $R_{ki}^{US}$ belonging to this
transformation. Now, clearly, Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII69">6.9</a>)
and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII610">6.10</a>) should give the same amplitudes $C_k''$, and
this should be true no matter what the original state $\phi$ was which
gave us the amplitudes $C_i$. So it must be that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:11}
R_{ki}^{US}=\sum_jR_{kj}^{UT}R_{ji}^{TS}.
\end{equation}
In other words, for any rotation $S\to U$ of a reference base, which
is viewed as a compounding of two successive rotations $S\to T$
and $T\to U$, the rotation matrix $R_{ki}^{US}$ can be obtained from the
matrices of the two partial rotations by Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII611">6.11</a>). If
you wish, you can find Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII611">6.11</a>) directly from

<p class="p">
To be thorough, we should add the following parenthetical
remarks. They are not terribly important, however, so you can skip to
the next section if you want. What we have said is not quite right. We
cannot really say that Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII69">6.9</a>) and
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII610">6.10</a>) must give <em class="emph">exactly</em> the same amplitudes.
Only the <em class="emph">physics</em> should be the same; all the amplitudes could be
different by some common phase factor like $e^{i\delta}$ without
changing the result of any calculation about the real world. So, instead
of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII611">6.11</a>), all we can say, really, is that
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:12}
e^{i\delta}R_{ki}^{US}=\sum_jR_{kj}^{UT}R_{ji}^{TS},
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is <em class="emph">some</em> real constant. What this extra factor
of $e^{i\delta}$ means, of course, is that the amplitudes we get if we
use the matrix $R^{US}$ might all differ by the same
phase $(e^{-i\delta})$ from the amplitude we would get using the two
rotations $R^{UT}$ and $R^{TS}$. We know that it doesn’t matter if all
amplitudes are changed by the same phase, so we could just ignore this
phase factor if we wanted to. It turns out, however, that if we define
all of our rotation matrices in a particular way, this extra phase
factor will never appear—the $\delta$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII612">6.12</a>)
will always be zero. Although it is not important for the rest of our
arguments, we can give a quick proof by using a mathematical theorem
about determinants. [If you don’t yet know much about determinants,
don’t worry about the proof and just skip to the definition of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII615">6.15</a>).]
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch6-S2-p10" class="para" style="font-size: 95%;">
<p class="p">
First, we should say that Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII611">6.11</a>) is the
mathematical definition of a “product” of two matrices. (It is just
convenient to be able to say: “$R^{US}$ is the product of $R^{UT}$
and $R^{TS}$.” )  Second, there is a theorem of mathematics—which
you can easily prove for the two-by-two matrices we have here—which
says that the determinant of a “product” of two matrices is the
product of their determinants. Applying this theorem to
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII612">6.12</a>), we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:13}
e^{i2\delta}\,(\Det R^{US})=(\Det R^{UT})\cdot(\Det R^{TS}).
\end{equation}
(We leave off the subscripts, because they don’t tell us anything
useful.) Yes, the $2\delta$ is right. Remember that we are dealing
with two-by-two matrices; every term in the matrix $R_{ki}^{US}$ is
multiplied by $e^{i\delta}$, so each product in the
determinant—which has <em class="emph">two</em> factors—gets multiplied
by $e^{i2\delta}$. Now let’s take the square root of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII613">6.13</a>) and divide it into Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII612">6.12</a>); we
get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:14}
\frac{R_{ki}^{US}}{\sqrt{\Det R^{US}}}=\sum_j
\frac{R_{kj}^{UT}}{\sqrt{\Det R^{UT}}}\,
\frac{R_{ji}^{TS}}{\sqrt{\Det R^{TS}}}.

The extra phase factor has disappeared.

<div id="Ch6-S2-p11" class="para" style="font-size: 95%;">
<p class="p">
Now it turns out that if we want all of our amplitudes in any given
representation to be normalized (which means, you remember, that
$\sum_i\braket{\phi}{i}\braket{i}{\phi}=1$), the rotation matrices
will all have determinants that are pure imaginary exponentials,
like $e^{i\alpha}$. (We won’t prove it; you will see that it always comes
out that way.) So we can, if we wish, choose to make all our rotation
matrices $R$ have a unique phase by making $\Det R=1$. It is done like
this. Suppose we find a rotation matrix $R$ in some arbitrary way. We
make it a rule to “convert” it to “standard form” by defining
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:15}
R_{\text{standard}}=\frac{R}{\sqrt{\Det R}}.
\end{equation}
We can do this because we are just multiplying each term of $R$ by the
same phase factor, to get the phases we want. In what follows, we will
always assume that our matrices have been put in the “standard
form” ; then we can use Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII611">6.11</a>) without having any
extra phase factors.

<div id="Ch6-S3-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">We are now ready to find the transformation matrix $R_{ji}$ between
two different representations. With our rule for compounding rotations
and our assumption that space has no preferred direction, we have the
keys we need for finding the matrix of any arbitrary rotation. There
is only <em class="emph">one</em> solution. We begin with the transformation which
corresponds to a rotation about the $z$-axis. Suppose we have two
apparatuses $S$ and $T$ placed in series along a straight line with
their axes parallel and pointing out of the page, as shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F4">6-4</a>(a). We take our “$z$-axis” in this direction.
Surely, if the beam goes “up” (toward $+z$) in the $S$ apparatus, it
will do the same in the $T$ apparatus. Similarly, if it goes down
in $S$, it will go down in $T$. Suppose, however, that the $T$ apparatus
were placed at some other angle, but still with its axis parallel to the
axis of $S$, as in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F4">6-4</a>(b). Intuitively, you would
say that a $(+)$ beam in $S$ would still go with a $(+)$ beam in $T$,
because the fields and field gradients are still in the same physical
direction. And that would be quite right. Also, a $(-)$ beam in $S$
would still go into a $(-)$ beam in $T$. The same result would apply for
any orientation of $T$ in the $xy$-plane of $S$. What does this tell us
about the relation between $C_+'=\braket{+T}{\psi}$,
$C_-'=\braket{-T}{\psi}$ and $C_+=\braket{+S}{\psi}$,
$C_-=\braket{-S}{\psi}$? You might conclude that any rotation about the
$z$-axis of the “frame of reference” for base states leaves the
amplitudes to be “up” and “down” the same as before.  We could write
$C_+'=C_+$ and $C_-'=C_-$—but that is <em class="emph">wrong</em>. All we <em class="emph">can</em>
conclude is that for such rotations the probabilities to be in the
“up” beam are the same for the $S$ and $T$ apparatuses. That is,
\begin{equation*}
\abs{C_+'}=\abs{C_+}\quad
\text{and}\quad
\abs{C_-'}=\abs{C_-}.

We cannot say that the <em class="emph">phases</em> of the amplitudes referred to the

<p class="p">The two apparatuses in (a) and (b) of Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F4">6-4</a> are, in
fact, different, as we can see in the following way. Suppose that we
put an apparatus in front of $S$ which produces a pure $(+x)$ state.
(The $x$-axis points toward the bottom of the figure.) Such
particles would be split into $(+z)$ and $(-z)$ beams in $S$, but the
two beams would be recombined to give a $(+x)$ state again
at $P_1$—the exit of $S$. The same thing happens again in $T$. If we
follow $T$ by a third apparatus $U$, whose axis is in the
$(+x)$ direction and, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F5">6-5</a>(a), all the
particles would go into the $(+)$ beam of $U$. Now imagine what
happens if $T$ and $U$ are swung around <em class="emph">together</em> by $90^\circ$
to the positions shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F5">6-5</a>(b). Again, the
$T$ apparatus puts out just what it takes in, so the particles that enter
$U$ are in a $(+x)$ state with respect to $S$. But $U$ now analyzes
for the $(+y)$ state with respect to $S$, which is different. (By
symmetry, we would now expect only one-half of the particles to get
through.)

<p class="p">What could have changed? The apparatuses $T$ and $U$ are still in the
same <em class="emph">physical</em> relationship to each other. Can the
<em class="emph">physics</em> be changed just because $T$ and $U$ are in a different
orientation? Our original assumption is that it should not. It must be
that the <em class="emph">amplitudes</em> with respect to $T$ are different in the
two cases shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F5">6-5</a>—and, therefore, also in
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F4">6-4</a>. There must be some way for a particle to
know that it has turned the corner at $P_1$. How could it tell? Well,
all we have decided is that the <em class="emph">magnitudes</em> of $C_+'$ and $C_+$
are the same in the two cases, but they could—in fact,
<em class="emph">must</em>—have different <em class="emph">phases</em>. We conclude that $C_+'$
and $C_+$ must be related by
\begin{equation*}
C_+'=e^{i\lambda}C_+,
\end{equation*}
and that $C_-'$ and $C_-$ must be related by
\begin{equation*}
C_-'=e^{i\mu}C_-,
\end{equation*}
where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are real numbers which must be related in
some way to the angle between $S$ and $T$.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch6-S3-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">The only thing we can say at the moment about $\lambda$ and $\mu$ is
that they must not be equal [except for the special case shown in
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F5">6-5</a>(a), when $T$ is in the same orientation
as $S$]. We have seen that equal phase changes in all amplitudes have no
physical consequence. For the same reason, we can always add the same
arbitrary amount to both $\lambda$ and $\mu$ without changing
anything. So we are permitted to <em class="emph">choose</em> to make $\lambda$
and $\mu$ equal to plus and minus the same number. That is, we can always
take
\begin{equation*}
\lambda'=\lambda-\frac{(\lambda+\mu)}{2},\quad
\mu'=\mu-\frac{(\lambda+\mu)}{2}.
\end{equation*}
Then
\begin{equation*}
\lambda'=\frac{\lambda}{2}-\frac{\mu}{2}=-\mu'.
\end{equation*}
So we adopt the convention<a name="footnote_source_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup class="mark">2</sup></a>
that $\mu=-\lambda$. We have then the general rule that for a rotation of
the reference apparatus by some angle about the $z$-axis, the
transformation is
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:16}
C_+'=e^{+i\lambda}C_+,\quad
C_-'=e^{-i\lambda}C_-.
\end{equation}
The absolute values are the same, only the phases are different. These
phase factors are responsible for the different results in the two
experiments of Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F5">6-5</a>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch6-S3-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we would like to know the law that relates $\lambda$ to the angle
between $S$ and $T$. We already know the answer for one case. If the
angle is zero, $\lambda$ is zero. Now we will <em class="emph">assume</em> that the
phase shift $\lambda$ is a continuous function of angle $\phi$ between
$S$ and $T$ (see Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F4">6-4</a>) as $\phi$ goes to zero—as
only seems reasonable. In other words, if we rotate $T$ from the
straight line through $S$ by the small angle $\epsilon$, the $\lambda$
is also a small quantity, say $m\epsilon$, where $m$ is some
number. We write it this way because we can show that $\lambda$ must
be proportional to $\epsilon$. Suppose we were to put after $T$
another apparatus $T'$ which makes the angle $\epsilon$ with $T$, and,
therefore, the angle $2\epsilon$ with $S$. Then, with respect to $T$,
we have
\begin{equation*}
C_+'=e^{i\lambda}C_+,
\end{equation*}
and with respect to $T'$, we have
\begin{equation*}
C_+''=e^{i\lambda}C_+'=e^{i2\lambda}C_+.
\end{equation*}
But we know that we should get the same result if we put $T'$ right
after $S$. Thus, when the angle is doubled, the phase is doubled. We
can evidently extend the argument and build up any rotation at all by
a sequence of infinitesimal rotations. We conclude that for <em class="emph">any</em>
angle $\phi$, $\lambda$ is proportional to the angle. We can,
therefore, write $\lambda=m\phi$.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch6-S3-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">The general result we get, then, is that for $T$ rotated about the
$z$-axis by the angle $\phi$ with respect to $S$
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:17}
C_+'=e^{im\phi}C_+,\quad
C_-'=e^{-im\phi}C_-.
\end{equation}
For the angle $\phi$, and for all rotations we speak of in the future,
we adopt the standard convention that a <em class="emph">positive</em> rotation is a
<em class="emph">right-handed</em> rotation about the positive direction of the
reference axis. A positive $\phi$ has the sense of rotation of a
right-handed screw advancing in the positive $z$-direction.

</div>

<div id="Ch6-S3-p7" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we have to find what $m$ must be. First, we might try this
argument: Suppose $T$ is rotated by $360^\circ$; then, clearly, it is
right back at zero degrees, and we should have $C_+'=C_+$
and $C_-'=C_-$, or, what is the same thing, $e^{im2\pi}=1$. We
get $m=1$. <em class="emph">This argument is wrong!</em> To see that it is, consider that
$T$ is rotated by $180^\circ$. If $m$ were equal to $1$, we would have
$C_+'=$ $e^{i\pi}C_+=$ $-C_+$ and $C_-'=$ $e^{-i\pi}C_-=$ $-C_-$. However, this
is just the <em class="emph">original</em> state all over again. <em class="emph">Both</em>
amplitudes are just multiplied by $-1$ which gives back the original
physical system. (It is again a case of a common phase change.) This
means that if the angle between $T$ and $S$ in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F5">6-5</a>(b)
is increased to $180^\circ$, the system (with respect to $T$) would be
indistinguishable from the zero-degree situation, and the particles
would again go through the $(+)$ state of the $U$ apparatus.
At $180^\circ$, though, the $(+)$ state of the $U$ apparatus is the
$(-x)$ state of the original $S$ apparatus. So a $(+x)$ state would become a
$(-x)$ state. But we have done nothing to <em class="emph">change</em> the original
state; the answer is wrong. We cannot have $m=1$.

<div id="Ch6-S3-p8" class="para">
<p class="p">We must have the situation that a rotation by $360^\circ$ and <em class="emph">no

It is very curious to say that if you turn the apparatus $360^\circ$
you get new amplitudes. They aren’t really new, though, because the
common change of sign doesn’t give any different physics. If someone
else had decided to change all the signs of the amplitudes because he

one-half particles with respect to a reference frame $S$, and we then

rotation of $\phi$ around the $z$-axis, the new amplitudes are given

<div id="Ch6-S4-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Next, we will try to guess the transformation for a rotation of $T$
with respect to $S$ of $180^\circ$ around an axis <em class="emph">perpendicular</em>
to the $z$-axis—say, about the $y$-axis. (We have defined the
coordinate axes in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F1">6-1</a>.)  In other words, we
start with two identical Stern-Gerlach equipments, with the second
one, $T$, turned “upside down” with respect to the first one, $S$,
as in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F6">6-6</a>. Now if we think of our particles as
little magnetic dipoles, a particle that is in the $(+S)$ state—so
that it goes on the “upper” path in the first apparatus—will also
take the “upper” path in the second, so that it will be in the
<em class="emph">minus</em> state with respect to $T$. (In the inverted
$T$ apparatus, both the gradients <em class="emph">and</em> the field direction are
reversed; for a particle with its magnetic moment in a given
direction, the force is unchanged.)  Anyway, what is “up” with
respect to $S$ will be “down” with respect to $T$. For these
relative positions of $S$ and $T$, then, we know that the
transformation must give
\begin{equation*}
\abs{C_+'}=\abs{C_-},\quad
\abs{C_-'}=\abs{C_+}.
\end{equation*}
As before, we cannot rule out some additional phase factors; we could
have (for $180^\circ$ about the $y$-axis)
\begin{equation}

C_+'=e^{i\beta}C_-\quad

<div id="Ch6-S4-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">What about a rotation of $360^\circ$ about the $y$-axis? Well, we
already know the answer for a rotation of $360^\circ$ about the
$z$-axis—the amplitude to be in any state changes sign. A rotation
of $360^\circ$ around any axis always brings us back to the original
position. It must be that for <em class="emph">any</em> $360^\circ$ rotation, the
result is the same as a $360^\circ$ rotation about the $z$-axis—all
amplitudes simply change sign. Now suppose we imagine two successive
rotations of $180^\circ$ about $y$—using Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII620">6.20</a>)—we
should get the result of Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII618">6.18</a>). In other words,
\begin{equation*}
C_+''=e^{i\beta}C_-'=e^{i\beta}e^{i\gamma}C_+=-C_+
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:21}
C_-''=e^{i\gamma}C_+'=e^{i\gamma}e^{i\beta}C_-=-C_-.
\end{equation}
This means that
\begin{equation*}
e^{i\beta}e^{i\gamma}=-1\quad
\text{or}\quad
e^{i\gamma}=-e^{-i\beta}.

So the transformation for a rotation of $180^\circ$ about the $y$-axis
can be written

C_+'=e^{i\beta}C_-,\quad
C_-'=-e^{-i\beta}C_+.

<p class="p">The arguments we have just used would apply equally well to a rotation
of $180^\circ$ about <em class="emph">any</em> axis in the $xy$-plane, although
different axes can, of course, give different numbers for $\beta$.
However, that is the only way they can differ. Now there is a
certain amount of arbitrariness in the number $\beta$, but once it is
specified for one axis of rotation in the $xy$-plane it is determined
for any other axis. It is <em class="emph">conventional</em> to choose to

<p class="p">We can now think of getting to the same orientation by the two
successive rotations shown in (b) and (c) of the figure. First, we

will be as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F7">6-7</a>(b), and the amplitudes
<em class="emph">with respect to</em> $U$ are given by (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII622">6.22</a>).

<div id="Ch6-S4-p6" class="para">
<p class="p">Now notice that we can go from $U$ to $T$ by a rotation about the

Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F7">6-7</a>(c). From the figure you can see that the angle
required is two times the angle $\alpha$ but in the opposite direction
(with respect to $z'$). Using the transformation of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII619">6.19</a>)
with $\phi=-2\alpha$, we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:24}
C_+''=e^{-i\alpha}C_+',\quad

Combining Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII624">6.24</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII622">6.22</a>), we get

C_-''=-e^{-i(\beta-\alpha)}C_+.

These amplitudes must, of course, be the same as we got

and $\beta$ by
\begin{equation}

\beta_A=\beta-\alpha.

This means that if the angle $\alpha$ between the $A$-axis and the

<p class="p">While we are thinking about the $y$-axis, let’s next ask for the
transformation matrix for a rotation of $90^\circ$ about $y$. We can
find it because we know that two successive $90^\circ$ rotations about
the same axis must equal one $180^\circ$ rotation. We start by writing
the transformation for $90^\circ$ in the most general form:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:28}
C_+'=aC_++bC_-,\quad
C_-'=cC_++dC_-.

A second rotation of $90^\circ$ about the same axis would have the
same coefficients:

C_+''=aC_+'+bC_-',\quad
C_-''=cC_+'+dC_-'.

Combining Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII628">6.28</a>) and (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII629">6.29</a>), we have

These four equations are enough to determine all our unknowns: $a$, $b$,
$c$, and $d$. It is not hard to do. Look at the second and fourth
equations. Deduce that $a^2=d^2$, which means that $a=d$ or else that
$a=-d$. But $a=-d$ is out, because then the first equation wouldn’t be
right. So $d=a$. Using this, we have immediately that $b=1/2a$ and
that $c=-1/2a$. Now we have everything in terms of $a$. Putting, say,
the second equation all in terms of $a$, we have
\begin{equation*}
a^2-\frac{1}{4a^2}=0\quad
\text{or}\quad
a^4=\frac{1}{4}.
\end{equation*}
This equation has four different solutions, but only two of them give
the standard value for the determinant. We might as well

  by $\alpha$ about $z'$, followed by (c) a rotation of $-90^\circ$
  about $y''$.

<p class="p">(These facts of the combinations of rotations, and what they produce,
are hard to grasp intuitively. It is rather strange, because we live
in three dimensions, but it is hard for us to appreciate what happens
if we turn this way and then that way. Perhaps, if we were fish or
birds and had a real appreciation of what happens when we turn
somersaults in space, we could more easily appreciate such things.)

<div id="Ch6-S5-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">Anyway, let’s work out the transformation for a rotation by $\alpha$
around the $x$-axis by using what we know. From the first rotation
by $+90^\circ$ around $y$ the amplitudes go according to
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII632">6.32</a>). Calling the rotated axes $x'$, $y'$, and $z'$,
the next rotation by the angle $\alpha$ around $z'$ takes us to a frame
$x''$, $y''$, $z''$, for which
\begin{equation*}
C_+''=e^{i\alpha/2}C_+',\quad
C_-''=e^{-i\alpha/2}C_-'.
\end{equation*}
The last rotation of $-90^\circ$ about $y''$ takes us to $x'''$,
$y'''$, $z'''$; by (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII633">6.33</a>),
\begin{equation*}
C_+'''=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,(C_+''-C_-''),\quad
C_-'''=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,(C_+''+C_-'').
\end{equation*}
Combining these last two transformations, we get
\begin{align*}
C_+'''&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,
(e^{+i\alpha/2}C_+'-e^{-i\alpha/2}C_-'),\\
\\
C_-'''&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,
(e^{+i\alpha/2}C_+'+e^{-i\alpha/2}C_-').
\end{align*}
Using Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII632">6.32</a>) for $C_+'$ and $C_-'$, we get the
complete transformation:
\begin{align*}
C_+'''&=\tfrac{1}{2}
\{e^{+i\alpha/2}(C_++C_-)-e^{-i\alpha/2}(-C_++C_-)\},\\
\\
C_-'''&=\tfrac{1}{2}
\{e^{+i\alpha/2}(C_++C_-)+e^{-i\alpha/2}(-C_++C_-)\}.
\end{align*}
We can put these formulas in a simpler form by remembering that
\begin{equation*}
e^{i\theta}+e^{-i\theta}=2\cos\theta,\quad\text{and}\quad e^{i\theta}-e^{-i\theta}=2i\sin\theta.
\end{equation*}
We get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:34}

Here is our transformation for a rotation about the $x$-axis by

the others.

<div id="Ch6-S6-p1" class="para">
<p class="p">Now we can see how to do <em class="emph">any</em> angle at all. First, notice that
any relative orientation of two coordinate frames can be described in
terms of three angles, as shown in Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F9">6-9</a>. If we
have a set of axes $x'$, $y'$, and $z'$ oriented in any way at all
with respect to $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can describe the relationship
between the two frames by means of the three Euler angles $\alpha$, $\beta$,
and $\gamma$, which define three successive rotations that
will bring the $x$, $y$, $z$ frame into the $x'$, $y'$, $z'$
frame. Starting at $x$, $y$, $z$, we rotate our frame through the
angle $\beta$ about the $z$-axis, bringing the $x$-axis to the
line $x_1$. Then, we rotate by $\alpha$ about this temporary $x$-axis, to
bring $z$ down to $z'$. Finally, a rotation about the new $z$-axis
(that is, $z'$) by the angle $\gamma$ will bring the $x$-axis into $x'$
and the $y$-axis into $y'$.<a name="footnote_source_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup class="mark">6</sup></a> We know the transformations for each of the three

<div id="Ch6-S6-p2" class="para">
<p class="p">So just starting from some assumptions about the properties of space,
we have derived the amplitude transformation for any rotation at
all. That means that if we know the amplitudes for any state of a spin
one-half particle to go into the two beams of a Stern-Gerlach
apparatus $S$, whose axes are $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can calculate what
fraction would go into either beam of an apparatus $T$ with the axes
$x'$, $y'$, and $z'$. In other words, if we have a state $\psi$ of a
spin one-half particle, whose amplitudes are $C_+=\braket{+}{\psi}$
and $C_-=\braket{-}{\psi}$ to be “up” and “down” with respect to
the $z$-axis of the $x$, $y$, $z$ frame, we also know the amplitudes
$C_+'$ and $C_-'$ to be “up” and “down” with respect to the
$z'$-axis of any other frame $x'$, $y'$, $z'$. The four coefficients
in Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII635">6.35</a>) are the terms of the “transformation
matrix” with which we can project the amplitudes of a spin one-half
particle into any other coordinate system.

</div>

<div id="Ch6-S6-p3" class="para">
<p class="p">We will now work out a few examples to show you how it all
works. Let’s take the following simple question. We put a spin
one-half atom through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus that transmits only the
$(+z)$ state. What is the amplitude that it will be in the $(+x)$ state? 
The $+x$ axis is the same as the $+z'$ axis of a system
rotated $90^\circ$ about the $y$-axis. For this problem, then, it is
simplest to use Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII632">6.32</a>)—although you could, of
course, use the complete equations of (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII635">6.35</a>). Since
$C_+=1$ and $C_-=0$, we get $C_+'=1/\sqrt{2}$. The probabilities are
the absolute square of these amplitudes; there is a $50$ percent
chance that the particle will go through an apparatus that selects the
$(+x)$ state. If we had asked about the $(-x)$ state the amplitude
would have been $-1/\sqrt{2}$, which also gives a
probability $1/2$—as you would expect from the symmetry of space. So if a
particle is in the $(+z)$ state, it is equally likely to be in $(+x)$
or $(-x)$, but with opposite phase.
</p>
</div>

<div id="Ch6-S6-p4" class="para">
<p class="p">There’s no prejudice in $y$ either. A particle in the $(+z)$ state has a
$50$&ndash;$50$ chance of being in $(+y)$ or in $(-y)$. However, for these
(using the formula for rotating $-90^\circ$ about $x$), the amplitudes
are $1/\sqrt{2}$ and $-i/\sqrt{2}$. In this case, the two amplitudes
have a phase difference of $90^\circ$ instead of $180^\circ$, as they
did for the $(+x)$ and $(-x)$. In fact, that’s how the distinction
between $x$ and $y$ shows up.

<div id="Ch6-S6-p5" class="para">
<p class="p">As our final example, suppose that we know that a spin one-half
particle is in a state $\psi$ such that it is polarized “up” along
some axis $A$, defined by the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ in
Fig. <a href="#Ch6-F10">6-10</a>. We want to know the amplitude $C_+$ that the
particle is “up” along $z$ and the amplitude $C_-$ that it is “down” 
along $z$.  We can find these amplitudes by imagining that $A$ is the
$z$-axis of a system whose $x$-axis lies in some arbitrary
direction—say in the plane formed by $A$ and $z$. We can then bring
the frame of $A$ into $x$, $y$, $z$ by three rotations. First, we make a
rotation by $-\pi/2$ about the axis $A$, which brings the $x$-axis into
the line $B$ in the figure. Then we rotate by $\theta$ about line $B$
(the new $x$-axis of frame $A$) to bring $A$ to the $z$-axis. Finally,
we rotate by the angle $(\pi/2-\phi)$ about $z$. Remembering that we
have only a $(+)$ state with respect to $A$, we get
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:III:6:36}
C_+=\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\,e^{-i\phi/2},\quad
C_-=\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\,e^{+i\phi/2}.

<p class="p">We would like, finally, to summarize the results of this chapter in a
form that will be useful for our later work. First, we remind you that
our primary result in Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII635">6.35</a>) can be written in
another notation. Note that Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII635">6.35</a>) mean just the
same thing as Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII64">6.4</a>). That is, in
Eqs. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII635">6.35</a>) the coefficients of $C_+=\braket{+S}{\psi}$
and $C_-=\braket{-S}{\psi}$ are just the amplitudes $\braket{jT}{iS}$ of
Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII64">6.4</a>)—the amplitudes that a particle in the
$i$-state with respect to $S$ will be in the $j$-state with respect
to $T$ (when the orientation of $T$ with respect to $S$ is given in terms
of the angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$). We also called them
$R_{ji}^{TS}$ in Eq. (<a href="#mjx-eqn-EqIII66">6.6</a>). (We have a plethora of
notations!) For example, $R_{-+}^{TS}=\braket{-T}{+S}$ is the
coefficient of $C_+$ in the formula for $C_-'$, namely,
$i\sin\,(\alpha/2)\,e^{i(\beta-\gamma)/2}$. We can, therefore, make a
summary of our results in the form of a table, as we have done in

    Also, if something has been rotated by a sequence of
small rotations whose net result is to return it to the original
orientation, it is possible to define the idea that it has been
rotated $360^\circ$—as distinct from zero net rotation—if you have
kept track of the whole history. (Interestingly enough, this is
<em class="emph">not</em> true for a net rotation of $720^\circ$.)

    With a little work you can
show that the frame $x$, $y$, $z$ can also be brought into the frame
$x'$, $y'$, $z'$ by the following three rotations about the
